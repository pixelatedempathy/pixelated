# Recruitment Plan – Phase 1.3 Annotation & Labeling

**Objective**: Build a high‑quality labeled dataset for the Pixel therapeutic‑enhancement model with **Cohen’s Kappa > 0.85** and full coverage of all 5 000+ samples.

## 1. Target Profile

| Role | Required Credentials | Preferred Experience | Responsibilities |
|------|----------------------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Clinical Annotator** | • Master’s or Doctoral degree in Psychology, Psychiatry, Social Work, or related field  <br>• Active licensure (or equivalent certification) | • 1–2 years of clinical documentation, diagnostic coding, or case‑note review experience | Apply label taxonomy, flag safety‑triggers, provide justification notes |
| **Quality Assurance (QA) Annotator** | • Same baseline credentials <br>• Proven experience in research reliability studies | • Experience with inter‑annotator agreement calculations (Cohen’s Kappa) | Conduct double‑blind reviews, calculate Kappa, resolve conflicts |
| **Safety‑Screening Specialist** | • Licensed clinician with risk‑assessment training | • Experience in crisis intervention hotlines or emergency response | Perform safety‑screening on all items flagged `Safety‑Trigger`; ensure escalation protocols are followed |

## 2. Sourcing Channels

| Channel | How to Post | Targeting Tips |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| **Professional Networks** (LinkedIn, APA LinkedIn groups, NASW forums) | Post a concise “Research Study – Paid Annotation Opportunity (≈ $25 / hour)” with link to application form | Use keywords *clinical annotation, research data labeling, mental‑health research* |
| **Academic Departments** (Psychology, Psychiatry, Social Work) | Contact department secretaries to circulate a flyer; ask graduate‑assistantship offices for student‑worker pools | Offer course‑credit option or stipend; prioritize PhD candidates in clinical psychology |
| **Clinical Practice Networks** (e.g., TherapyNet, local health‑system staff newsletters) | Submit a brief description to practice managers; ask them to forward to clinicians interested in side‑project work | Emphasize flexible hours, remote work, and compensation |
| **Online Freelance Platforms** (Upwork, Fiverr) | Create a vetted “Research Annotation” job posting; include a short screening questionnaire | Filter for candidates who pass a brief clinical‑knowledge quiz before hiring |
| **Referral Program** | Incentivize current annotators to refer peers (e.g., $50 bonus per successful hire) | Track referral source for quality control |

---

## 3. Screening & Selection Process

1. **Application Form** – Collect: name, credentials, licensure number, brief CV, availability (hrs/week), and a short statement on why they’re interested.
2. **Screening Quiz** – 5‑question multiple‑choice test covering:
   - Label definitions (e.g., difference between `Suicidal` and `Self‑Harm`)
   - Safety‑trigger identification
   - Basic inter‑rater reliability concepts
3. **Live Calibration Exercise** – Provide 3 sample items; ask the candidate to label them and justify each choice. Senior annotator reviews for conceptual accuracy.
4. **Background Check** – Verify licensure status via state licensing board (if applicable).
5. **Offer & Onboarding** – Send compensation details, confidentiality agreement, and platform access instructions.

*Target throughput:* 15 qualified annotators within the first 2 weeks to allow parallel double‑blind labeling.

## 4. Training & Calibration

| Training Module | Duration | Content |
|-----------------|----------|---------|
| **Platform Walk‑through** | 30 min | How to import text, apply labels, add secondary tags, submit notes |
| **Label Taxonomy Deep‑Dive** | 45 min | Detailed walkthrough of each category, edge‑case examples, and secondary‑tag rules |
| **Safety‑Trigger Protocol** | 20 min | Recognizing mandatory‑reporting language, escalation chain, and documentation requirements |
| **Quality‑Control Overview** | 30 min | Understanding double‑blind workflow, conflict‑resolution steps, and Kappa calculation |
| **Mock Annotation Session** | 60 min | Annotate 5 pre‑selected items; senior annotator provides feedback and discusses rationale |

All training materials (slides, recordings, FAQ) are stored in the `training/` folder of the repository for version control.

---

## 5. Compensation & Logistics

| Item | Details |
|------|---------|
| **Hourly Rate** | $25 USD / hour (benchmark for clinical contract work) |
| **Payment Method** | Automated Payroll via university‑affiliated payroll system or direct bank transfer (contractor agreement) |
| **Hours** | Flexible; annotators choose 5–20 hr blocks per week, with a mandatory minimum of 10 hrs / week to ensure dataset velocity |
| **Remote Setup** | All work is fully remote; annotators receive a secure link to the annotation platform and a VPN token for accessing internal data sources |
| **Equipment Reimbursement** | Up to $100 USD for headset or ergonomic chair (submitted via expense form) |

---

## 6. Timeline

| Week | Milestone |
|------|-----------|
| **Week 1** | Post job ads, collect applications, begin screening quiz |
| **Week 2** | Complete screening, live calibration, and background checks; extend offers |
| **Week 3** | Conduct training modules; run mock annotation session; finalize annotator roster |
| **Week 4** | Begin double‑blind labeling of pilot set (≈ 200 items) and calculate provisional Kappa |
| **Week 5** | Refine guidelines based on Kappa results; scale up to full dataset |
| **Week 6–8** | Full‑scale labeling (target 2 500 items/week) |
| **Week 9** | Complete labeling, calculate final Kappa (≥ 0.85) and perform QA audit |
| **Week 10** | Package final labeled dataset for training pipeline |

---

## 7. Success Metrics (Recruitment Phase)

- **Qualified Applicant Yield:** ≥ 30 applicants from combined channels.
- **Screening Pass Rate:** ≥ 60 % pass the screening quiz.
- **Training Completion:** 100 % of hired annotators finish all mandatory modules.
- **Initial Kappa (pilot set):** ≥ 0.80 before full‑scale labeling begins.
- **Time‑to‑Hire:** ≤ 14 days from ad posting to offer acceptance.

---

## 8. Contingency Plans

- **Low Yield of Qualified Applicants:** Expand outreach to international clinical training programs; offer remote stipend to attract global talent.
- **High Attrition:** Implement a “probation‑before‑pay” pilot (first 5 hrs paid only after successful calibration) to ensure commitment.
- **Skill Mismatch:** If initial annotators struggle with nuanced labels, provide supplemental micro‑training videos focused on ambiguous edge cases.

---

### Next Action

- **Create the application form** (Google Form or REDCap) and publish the posting to the identified channels.
- **Schedule a kickoff call** with the study PI and the eventual annotator cohort (≈ 30 min) to walk through the taxonomy and safety protocols.

Let me know if you’d like the application‑form template drafted, the kickoff‑call agenda prepared, or any part of this recruitment plan refined before execution.
