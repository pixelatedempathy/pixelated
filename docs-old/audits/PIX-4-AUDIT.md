# PIX-4 Audit Report

**Date**: 2026-02-20  
**Auditor**: Code Assistant  
**Task**: Verify & Download Tier 3 & Tier 4 Datasets  

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL FINDING: PIX-4 Identity Crisis

There are **MULTIPLE CONFLICTING DEFINITIONS** of PIX-4 in the codebase:

| Reference | Title | Status | Meaning |
|----------|-------|--------|---------|
| **Jira PIX-4** | Verify & Download Tier 3 & Tier 4 Datasets (if needed) | To Do | Download CoT + Reddit datasets |
| **dataset_audit_final_report.md (line 223)** | P1 - YouTube Transcript Extraction Script | Missing | YouTube extraction |
| **metrics (line 170)** | 🟠 P1: YouTube Extraction | P1 | YouTube extraction |

### **Key Discrepancy**: The Jira PIX-4 is about dataset download, but other docs reference PIX-4 as YouTube extraction!

## 📊 Dataset Status Analysis

### Datasets Referenced in Jira PIX-4

| Dataset | Google Drive Location | Size | Status |
|---------|---------------------|------|--------|
| CoT_Neurodivergent_vs_Neurotypical_Interactions | `gdrive:datasets/CoT_Neurodivergent_vs_Neurotypical_Interactions_downloaded.json` | 53MB | ✅ Exists in GDrive |
| CoT_Philosophical_Understanding | `gdrive:datasets/` | Unknown | ⚠️ Path unclear |
| CoT_Rare-Diseases_And_Health-Conditions | `gdrive:datasets/CoT_Rare-Diseases_And_Health-Conditions/` | 65MB | ✅ Exists in GDrive |
| CoT-Reasoning_Cultural_Nuances | `gdrive:datasets/CoT-Reasoning_Cultural_Nuances/` | 42MB | ✅ Exists in GDrive |
| mental_disorders_reddit.csv | `gdrive:datasets/reddit_mental_health/` | 562MB | ✅ Exists in GDrive |
| Suicide_Detection.csv | `gdrive:datasets/reddit_mental_health/` | 160MB | ✅ Exists in GDrive |

**Total in GDrive**: ~882MB (exceeds the 786MB target in Jira!)

### Verification Commands (from Jira PIX-4)

```bash
# Tier 3 - CoT Datasets
ls ~/datasets/consolidated/cot/
ls ~/datasets/consolidated/reddit/
```

**Status**: NOT EXECUTED - Cannot verify without access to VPS

## 🔍 YouTube Script Investigation

### Audit Report Claim: "PIX-4 Scripts Missing"

From `metrics/dataset_audit_final_report.md`:
> ⚠️ YouTube/Books Extraction Scripts Missing (PIX-4, PIX-2)
> - Scripts referenced but not implemented

### Reality: Scripts DO EXIST! 🎉

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `ai/pipelines/voice/youtube_processor.py` | YouTube playlist processing | ✅ EXISTS |
| `ai/pipelines/voice/audio_downloader.py` | Audio download from YouTube | ✅ EXISTS |
| `ai/pipelines/orchestrator/youtube_rag_system.py` | YouTube RAG system | ✅ EXISTS |
| `ai/pipelines/voice/mcp_server.py` | MCP tool: `transcribe_youtube` | ✅ EXISTS |
| `ai/pipelines/voice/api/server.py` | API endpoints for transcription | ✅ EXISTS |

**Finding**: This is a FALSE POSITIVE in the audit. The YouTube extraction infrastructure is ALREADY IMPLEMENTED.

## 📋 Documentation Conflicts

### Conflict #1: Tier 4 Reddit Download Status

| Document | Claim |
|----------|-------|
| `TASK_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT_2026-02-17.md` (line 90) | ✅ `[x] Download Tier 4 Reddit Data` |
| `MASTER_TRAINING_EPIC.md` (line 320) | ⚠️ `[ ] Tier 4 Reddit Data (700MB+) - PENDING VERIFICATION` |
| Jira PIX-4 | ⏳ Status: "To Do" with "Status unknown (pending verification)" |

### Conflict #2: Tier 3 CoT Status

| Document | Claim |
|----------|-------|
| `TASK_CONSOLIDATION_AUDIT_2026-02-17.md` (line 106) | ❌ `[ ] HIGH: Download Tier 3 CoT Datasets` |
| `MASTER_TRAINING_EPIC.md` (line 312) | ⚠️ `[ ] Tier 3 CoT Datasets (86MB) - PENDING VERIFICATION` |

## 🎯 True State Assessment

### What PIX-4 Actually Is

Based on the current Jira issue, PIX-4 is a **verification task**:
1. Check if Tier 3 CoT datasets exist in `~/datasets/consolidated/cot/`
2. Check if Tier 4 Reddit datasets exist in `~/datasets/consolidated/reddit/`
3. If missing, download via rclone commands provided in the issue

### What PIX-4 Was Mistaken As

The audit report incorrectly conflates PIX-4 with YouTube extraction, which:
- Already has extensive infrastructure
- Has a working `transcribe_youtube` MCP tool
- Is a DIFFERENT task entirely

---

## ✅ Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Clarify PIX-4 Scope**
   - Current Jira PIX-4 = Dataset download verification
   - Create separate ticket for YouTube extraction if needed
   - Remove PIX-4 from the "missing scripts" list

2. **Execute Verification** (requires VPS access)
   ```bash
   ls ~/datasets/consolidated/cot/
   ls ~/datasets/consolidated/reddit/
   ```

3. **If Missing, Download**
   ```bash
   rclone copy gdrive:datasets/CoT_Neurodivergent_vs_Neurotypical_Interactions ~/datasets/consolidated/cot/
   rclone copy gdrive:datasets/CoT_Philosophical_Understanding ~/datasets/consolidated/cot/
   rclone copy gdrive:datasets/reddit_mental_health/mental_disorders_reddit.csv ~/datasets/consolidated/reddit/
   rclone copy gdrive:datasets/reddit_mental_health/Suicide_Detection.csv ~/datasets/consolidated/reddit/
   ```

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Remove PIX-4 from "missing scripts" list in audit reports
   - Update MASTER_TRAINING_EPIC with actual verification status
