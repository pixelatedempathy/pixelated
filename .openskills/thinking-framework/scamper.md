# SCAMPER

## Definition
Creativity technique using 7 prompts to modify existing ideas: Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to another use, Eliminate, Reverse.

## Steps
For each SCAMPER element, ask:
1. **Substitute**: What can be replaced? (materials, processes, people)
2. **Combine**: What can be combined with something else?
3. **Adapt**: What else is like this? What can we copy?
4. **Modify**: Change size, shape, color, form?
5. **Put to another use**: Other applications? Other markets?
6. **Eliminate**: Remove parts, simplify, reduce?
7. **Reverse**: Flip, invert, reverse sequence?

## Pros
- Quick ideation
- Structured creativity
- Easy to learn and apply

## Cons
- Modification-based (not first principles innovation)
- May produce incremental rather than breakthrough ideas
- Requires existing product/idea as starting point

## Example
**Product**: Traditional milk carton

- **Substitute**: Plastic → Plant-based packaging
- **Combine**: Milk + cereal in one package
- **Adapt**: Wine box dispenser design → milk dispenser
- **Modify**: Make carton square for better stacking
- **Put to another use**: Carton as seed starter pot after use
- **Eliminate**: Remove need for carton → direct dispenser at store
- **Reverse**: Instead of vertical pour, lay flat with spout (like detergent)

## When to Use
- Product innovation
- Creative brainstorming
- Incremental improvement
- Design variations

## Success Context
- **creative_innovation**: 100% success rate
- Best for: Quick ideation sessions and product improvements
- Use when: You have existing concept to modify/improve
- Avoid for: Breakthrough innovations (use First Principles instead)
