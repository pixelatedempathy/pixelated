## Phase 06 â€” Training & Evaluation Pipelines

Summary
-------
Phase 06 wires dataset outputs into reproducible training and evaluation pipelines: model training jobs, hyperparameter management, evaluation metrics, and reproducible artifacts (checkpoints, logs, manifests).

Primary goal
- Create production-ready training pipelines that accept dataset versions and produce validated model artifacts with reproducible metrics.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Define training manifests (dataset version, hyperparameters, seed, compute target)
- [ ] Implement reproducible training runners (containerized, GPU-capable) with logging and checkpointing
- [ ] Integrate evaluation scripts and standard metrics (accuracy, safety metrics, fairness metrics)
- [ ] Add automated evaluation gates for promoting a model to staging/production
- [ ] Add dataset-to-training traceability (which dataset commit/version produced this model)
- [ ] Add hyperparameter sweeps and tracking (e.g., with WandB or similar), and store artifacts
- [ ] Implement cost and resource accounting for runs to control spend
- [ ] Add tests and small smoke-training runs in CI (fast, low-resource) for sanity checks
- [ ] Document the training run process in `docs/ops/training.md` and provide sample manifests
- [ ] Ensure training infra supports rolling back to previous checkpoint reliably
- [ ] Provide alerting on unusual training metrics or failures
