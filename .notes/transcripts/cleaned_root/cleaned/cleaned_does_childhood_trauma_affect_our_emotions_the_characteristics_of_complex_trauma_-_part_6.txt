We are looking at the 85 characteristics of complex trauma.  So the way that complex trauma affects people, the way they learn to cope, the maladaptive survival strategies that kept the child safe, but began to cause problems in adult life.  Today, I want to look at how complex trauma affects the emotional world and and just to say up front is, to me, in working with clients all the time, it's just very sad to watch the huge amount of damage that happens in the emotional world, how we try to cope with painful emotions that becomes very maladaptive and causes all kinds of problems in adult life.  So I want to just give you a bunch of the different characteristics that come out of complex trauma around emotions.

But before I do it, I just want to give you kind of a backdrop of information that will help you understand all of these characteristics even better.  So the first thing to understand is that the brain is designed for really four feel good chemicals.  So it wants to have dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins and those all come out of safety, connection, their make a child feel very good.  What happens with complex trauma when there's danger, when the child cannot connect, is those four chemicals are absent somewhat in pretty much in the brain.  And they are replaced with cortisol, adrenaline and opioids.  So instead of getting these four feel good chemicals, they are getting other chemicals that are trying to help them escape pain.

But there's pain is really what is happening mainly in the child's life.  The reality for those children, then, is they cannot resolve the pain on their own.  Nobody's helping them resolve the pain.  They are not old enough to have tools to resolve the pain.  They cannot escape the pain.  And so these negative emotions are there, but then they just keep getting added to, added to, added to.  So there's more and more pain piling up inside of them.  The second thing to understand is that emotions in a healthy situation and a healthy family are designed to train a child in positive ways.  They are like the lights on a dashboard.  They tell you something's wrong underneath the hood in your environment so that you can fix it.  So when a child is in pain, the emotion of pain or fear, what does it do?  It pulls them to want to connect to mom and dad.  It pulls them to want to express their needs.  It pulls them in a healthy direction that would provide safety, healing and help them resolve.

But what happens to a child in complex trauma?  They experience hurt and pain.  They follow those instincts.  They go to mom and dad.  They express their needs, their feelings, and they get rejected.  They get punished.  They get neglected.  They get shamed.  So going in the positive direction is actually resulted in more pain.  And so now when they experience pain, the brain now pulls them in an opposite direction.  I am going to isolate.  I am going shut down.  I am not going to talk to anybody.  I am going to deny that I have needs.  So the limbic brain is now pulling them in the wrong direction in a self-destructive direction.  The limbic brain now has been mistrained and it is no longer a reliable guide.  So that's big picture.  Now if you look at this graph, a child in a healthy home, the red line on the top is they are mainly experiencing positive emotions.  And when they experience a negative emotion, parents comfort them, nurture them, give them tools to resolve it.  And so it's resolved.  It does not stay there.  They go back to a positive emotion.

But what are you seeing with the child in complex trauma?  Most of their emotions are negative.  They cannot resolve them.  They are getting more and more negative emotions all the time.  And so you can see this is not a very pleasant world to live in.  This is a very painful world that cannot be resolved.  And so because of that, the brain then goes to solutions that it hopes will resolve these emotions, fix this living in constant pain and emptiness.  And that's where these characteristics come from.  So the very first one is that most people from complex trauma become emotional stuffers.  I cannot resolve the emotion of pain.  I cannot fix it.  So just stuff it.  Somehow get rid of it.  And part of what they do with that is they repress the emotions.

But then they kind of see all emotions as bad because all of their emotions have only led to more painful situations.  Or they see emotions as unnecessary.  Who needs emotions?  I just need to be in my head and think and figure stuff out in life.  Emotions just make life messy.  Emotions make life difficult.  They add more problems.  So emotions are bad and unnecessary.  So different methods are used by the brain to try to suppress the emotions to stuff them down so that they are kind of below the conscious level.  So number one is as soon as they feel a negative emotion, it's like a switch flips in their head and they immediately shove it down.  They immediately repress it.  Some of that can even happen subconsciously for them.  They are not even aware that they do it.  They have done it for so long.  Others as soon as they feel emotions, they escape to their head and more and more, they just live in their head.  And so the emotional world is something that they avoid at all costs and they justify it by they are just totally thinking through life constantly and that to them is very healthy.  Some children they go to the mindset of whatever because what they have realized is if you care about something, then it hurts more when you lose it.  So do not care about anything.  Just whatever about everything.  Do not get attached to anything.  Do not have any feelings towards anything because that will only add more pain ultimately to you.  So with that, for some kids, is they just heart in their heart.  Do not love.  Do not have warm emotions.  Do not connect.  Just be a hard person.  That's how you protect yourself from pain.  So it's turning the heart into a stone so that it cannot be penetrated by anything.  Some, instead of feeling emotions, I would rather just stay busy.  So I need constant distractions.  As long as I am busy doing something, then I do not have time to feel.  So I become a workaholic.  I will constantly be doing something that keeps me from feeling.  Others, let's medicate emotions.  As soon as I feel them, so I can use distractions, but I can also use sex.  I can also use food.  I can also use gambling, TV, whatever, anything that creates a pleasure that's artificial, but it's a pleasure that meditates the emotions.  Or I can use anger.  So if I get angry, then I do not feel pain.  So I use other emotions to try to medicate the pain.  For many, they end up in what we would define as emotional anorexia.  They have pushed down, suppressed their emotions for so long.  They no longer even know they are there.  It's like the person who suppressed their hunger desire for so long, they no longer feel hunger.  So emotional anorexia, I have seen it in so many people.  They do not even, they are not even aware of their emotions.  You ask them what they are feeling.  They do not know.  They have repressed it for so long.  It's almost like it's a system that's been shut down and does not even know how to work and is not even acknowledged.  So that seems to work for the child.

But in adult life, they start to have problems.  So problem number one is when you are suppressing all of your emotions, basically what you are saying is I am weak because I have these weak emotions.  These emotions are bad.  They are part of me that I do not like.  These emotions, if I show them, embarrass me.  And so it just builds shame.  That because I have these emotions, because I have to repress them, I must be a bad person.  So they try to lock their emotions away.  The second thing that happens is even though you repress emotions, even though you try to convince yourself, you are just a thinker and you make all your decisions based on thinking, your emotions are still operating your life at a subconscious level.  Your fear, your anger, all of that is still running the show.  You are not aware of it, but it is.  And so you are making decisions often based on emotions more than on thinking.  You may have developed systems to deny that to yourself, but if you stop and look at it, you will probably see that it's there.  The next problem is so you have got all these repressed emotions that are down there.  As soon as they are triggered, so somebody touches your fear.  Somebody touches your fear of abandonment, fear of disrespect, fear of criticism, fear of getting hurt, fear of failure.  All of a sudden you are going back to old behaviors.  So you might be going along in your life and living very healthy behaviors, but soon as that fear that you are not even aware of gets triggered, you regressed old behaviors, old survival things.  So as long as those emotions stay repressed and you do not acknowledge them, you are only going to get healthy to a certain degree.  Because as long as they get triggered, you just keep going back to old behaviors.  And so you do not grow beyond that point.  Another very tricky thing is when people repress emotions, they think they are only repressing negative emotions.

But in reality, you are repressing all emotions.  You are repressing your ability to feel a lot of positive emotions, to feel joy, to feel a contentment.  So you cannot just divide negative from positive emotions and only repress one.  You are repressing it all.  And it's making you feel like a robot dead inside, emotionally stunted.  Then a lot of people, when they shut down emotions, the way to make sure they do it is to harden themselves, turn off their conscience so that I do not want to care.  I do not want to feel guilty about anything.  So let's shut down my conscience.  Let's shut down caring.  So let's just get harder and harder inside.  Because everything makes me weak.  Emotions make me weak.  I need to be strong.  So that means I need to not feel.  I need to be hard.  So that usually then develops a person who's got a lot of anger who does not have empathy.  And that then leads to the next problem is it begins to affect all your relationships.  People cannot get close to you.  People want to have intimacy, but they cannot with you.  There's a hardness.  There's an inability to connect emotionally with people.  People see you as distant.  People just say I try to connect, but you are emotionally unavailable.  All of those things begin to cause relationships to break down.  So conflicts begin to increase tensions, mount, and then you drift apart more and more.  So it always affects relationships negatively.  That then, when you have shut down emotions, you are dead inside.  You feel no joy.  There's a growing loneliness.  There's a growing emptiness that is haunting for people.  So this stuffing of emotions is so common in complex trauma, but it is an major issue for people to begin healing from in their recovery journey, to begin to allow themselves to feel emotions, to identify emotions, to learn how to handle emotions, how to express emotions.  That becomes emotional intelligence.  And it is a huge topic because a lot of people after they have repressed emotions for so long, they do not even are not aware they have emotions.  They do not even know what the feeling is.  They do not auto-identify it.  And it takes a lot of time to develop emotional intelligence.  So be patient with yourself.  The next issue that comes out of all of this emotional stuff with complex trauma is they have trouble regulating their emotions.  So they dysregulate very quickly.  They go from zero to a hundred in a nanoseconds.  So they are calm, one minute, something happens, and then it's an explosion.  They just cannot regulate their emotions.  So let me go back to childhood.  Children babies have no natural tools to regulate emotions.  They learn to regulate their emotions by having a co-regulator.  And that co-regulator needs to be a person who is calm, a person who is safe, so a person who's regulated themselves.  So the baby's vagus nerve, their neural section senses the vibes of this other person.  Are they stressed out?  Are they angry?  Are they safe?  Okay, if they are safe, they are in a calm place, then I can connect to them and regulate my own emotions.  So that is where it starts.  So what then does the co-regulator, the parent do to help regulate this child?  And as they regulate this child over and over again, the child begins to learn tools to regulate themselves.  Because they are picking up from the parent, the things that they do that are helping them calm down.  First thing that we have come to realize about regulating emotions is, so if you look in a child in the womb, where they feel safe, where they have a secure little world, they have a rhythm that they are hearing all the time.  And that's the mother's heartbeat.  60 to 80 beats a minute.  And what we found is that when a child is dysregulated, an infant is dysregulated, if they can return to hearing or feeling the rhythm of 60 to 80 beats a minute, so rocking music that has a steady rhythm, padding them on the back.  All of a sudden, something in the brain goes, I feel safe again and they can calm down.  So rhythm has this amazing ability to regulate emotions.  And so what we have found is that for people coming out of complex trauma, when they are dysregulated, often you cannot think your way to a regulated state, you got to go bottom up, you got to go to rhythm stuff.

So, walking, dancing, doodling, even cleaning has a rhythm.  A back rub, a massage, music, all of that has a steady rhythm that can help regulate your emotions.  And breathing can be part of that as well.  Because often when a child is dysregulated, they take a deep breath and shudder and then they can regulate themselves.  So rhythm is key.  If a child though does not get rhythm provided for them by the parents, so the parents leave them alone, the parents get angry at them, the parents do not, be a co-regulator to them.  The child typically will begin to develop self-soothing activities.  They will come across things that they find are helpful.  So they will suck their thumb, they will get a blanky, they will get a teddy bear, they will rock in their bed.

But then for some it, as it goes to stuff that seems to be soothing them, it has a rhythm, but it can become destructive.  So they will start banging their head.  They will start hitting themselves, pulling their hair regularly.  Some escape into a fantasy world, they dissociate that way.  All of that seems to be soothing, but it actually becomes self-destructive.  And so it becomes very important for them in recovery to learn healthy self-soothing versus unhealthy self-soothing.  The other thing that happens in the child who did not have a parent who come in to regulate them, to give them the tools to regulate, to provide the rhythm for them, is that they do not have a lot of tools to regulate their emotions.  And now when they have any negative emotion, fear, especially stress, they disregulate quickly.  Because they have no ability to know how to handle even the early eight stages of stress and fear.  And so that's where they go from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond.  And what's so important to understand is this person can be wonderful 99% of the time.

But when they get triggered and they disregulate in adult life, that's when the damage happens in the relationship.  The other thing then that we have learned regulates a child, a baby, is they are connecting to this co-regulator.  So connection helps the vagus nerve when they connect with a safe person to become regulated.  So they need connection to a safe person who's not going to judge them.  Then they need the need met.  So rhythm helps.  Connection is vital.  Then the need has to be met.  When that happens, then the child is regulated.

Now, beyond if those do not happen, what the brain then does to regulate the child is produce chemicals, opioids.  Those are designed to help the child regulate when nothing else is working.  And so in extreme cases today for people in recovery, if they are so dysregulated that nothing is working, they may need medication temporarily.  So let's go to what dysregulates a child.  The first thing is when they have a need that's not met.  So you have your vagus nerve is keeping track of all your needs in your body, physical needs, emotional needs, all your organs.  So if a need is out of balance, so your internal systems are out of balance, you feel discomfort, you feel hunger, you feel thirst, you feel itch, you feel a pain, you feel a cramp.  All of those things cause discomfort.  Then the child cries.  The child expresses that need.  That's the only way they can.  So the parents come figure connect, figure out what the need is, meet the need, soothe the child, everything is taken care of.  So having a system that is out of balance, dysregulates us.

But secondly, when a child is trying to connect, which they need for survival, but they are not able to connect, then that dysregulates them greatly.  Because now they feel all alone, now they feel afraid.  So not connecting, dysregulates.  The third thing is if their perception or interception of the vagus nerve is picking up danger.  So there's danger in their external world or their vibes are sensing, somebody is not safe.  That dysregulates the child.  So if there's the potential for feeling, getting hurt, then the stress system is activated.  The person becomes dysregulated because now it's we got to go to fight flight to get out of here because this is not a safe situation.  So as I said, emotional dysregulation comes out of a child not being able to connect, not getting their needs, not having a co-regulator to soothe them.  And so they just do not have the ability to deal with intense emotions, to regulate their own emotions.  And now when they are triggered, they go nanosecond zero to a hundred tons of damage done.  That causes many people to go, I think I need help because I am hurting those I love.  And those are the only ones I am hurting greatly.  And I just cannot continue to do that.

But learning to regulate emotions is such an important skill.  And there's so many practical tools that you can learn to do that.

But there are many tools that need to be learned.  The next characteristic is emotional reasoning.  So it's the limbic brain that is reasoning.  So as you think, healthy reasoning for us comes out of the cortex where we can look at all the evidence, the facts, look at it from different perspectives, weigh out everything, hear different input from different people.  And we end up with some good reasoning.  The limbic brain, when it reasons, it does not look at facts.  Its primary basis for determining truth is how it feels.  So if I feel a certain way, that must be the truth of the situation.  So if it feels like you rejected me because you set a boundary with me, then you must have rejected me.  You might be setting a boundary to make a healthier relationship.

But that feels like rejection.  So you must be rejecting me.  So I am not looking at evidence.  I am looking at feelings.  If I am having a bad day and nobody calls me, nobody texts me.  I guess nobody cares about me.  That's what it feels like.  So it must be true.  So what can happen for people in complex trauma where they only have the limbic brain is all of their reasoning comes out of the limbic brain.  And if they remain in complex trauma, the limbic brain continues to be the dominant force in how their brain works.  So then how they get to adult life in recovery.  And they are learning to reason out of their cortex.  And they are doing a better and better job at that.

But as soon as their limbic brain gets triggered, all of a sudden, they go back to limbic brain reasoning, emotional reasoning.  All of a sudden, their whole sense of this is true.  Why?  Not because of the evidence because I feel a certain way.  Now if you try to reason with a person when they are in that state, it's very, very difficult.  It's almost impossible because they do not see that a lot of their thinking is irrational because it feels so true.  How can it be wrong?  And so often in early recovery, people when they get triggered, they go to emotional reasoning and they just cannot see that there's a problem.  It takes a while for them to begin to realize, wow, that was really distorted.  That discounted or excluded a whole bunch of facts in that moment.  I got tunnel vision.  I got distorted, but it felt so true.  The danger is is when you are in that emotional reasoning state, that's when people can make some bad decisions.  So all of a sudden, they are ghosting a healthy person who set a boundary with them because they say, wow, feels like you rejected me.  So I guess you rejected me.  It feels like you are abandon me.  So I guess you are abandon me.  So I will abandon you.  Or I think you disrespected me because you set a boundary.  So I am going to develop a resentment against you.  I am now going to see you as a very unkind person.  I am not going to see you as a person who just disrespects people.  And obviously, you got a resentment that's not based on facts.  It's based on a distortion, a lie that came out of your emotional reasoning.  So in recovery, it becomes so important to begin to understand or know or identify when you go into your limbic brain.

Now, at first, often you do not even realize that.  Sometimes you need somebody else to point that out to you.

But once you begin to realize, oops, I am in my limbic brain.  I am feeling intense emotions.  Okay, all my reasoning is probably going to get distorted now.  So do not trust it.

But I got to get back to my cortex.  I got to regulate my emotions.  I got to figure out how to calm myself down and get back to my cortex.  And that could take several minutes.  I could take several hours.  I could even take several days for some people.  So it's just being aware that my limbic brain has been mistrained.  It now is an unreliable guide.  It has distorted reasoning.  So if I go there, I got to figure out how to get out of there and back to my cortex.  The next characteristic that comes out of complex trauma around emotions is anxiety issues.  So most people 90% at least of people with complex trauma have anxiety and depression issues.  So anxiety is the emotion we feel when we do not think we have resources to handle a situation or not sure if we have resources to handle situations.  So if you think of the child in complex trauma, their needs are not being met.  They are facing problems.  Nobody's helping them.  Nobody's giving them tools.  They feel all alone in facing this scary world.  So they constantly feel danger.  They constantly then feel stress overwhelmed.  And that means they constantly feel fear and anxiety.  That becomes their normal every day.  They feel it.  It's their default setting now.  And so the sad part of complex trauma is that because the child lived within this big scary world with no support and no tools, fear becomes their main emotion.  Anxiety becomes their constant companion.

But what is important to understand is that we often see fear and anxiety as a bad emotion.

But fear and anxiety were actually designed.  Their main purpose is to protect the child.  They are to alert us to danger so that we can get to safety so that we can either resolve the situation or fight or flight.  So we got to fix it or flee it.  That is what fear and anxiety purposes.  So fear and anxiety because danger can do so much damage and hurt us so badly, fear and anxiety tend to be very intense emotions.  They are not pleasant to live with.

But they do not care.  Their only function is to keep you safe.  They do not care whether you are happy.  They do not care about your relationships.  They do not care about your life goals.  It's all about survival.  And so they if they perceive a threat that threatens your safety, then they are indifferent to everything else in your life.  All they care about is keeping you safe.  So with complex trauma, they could never get you to safety.  So they become constant companions that you cannot resolve.  So they then become maladaptive over time.  Instead of protecting you now, they now drive you in situations that give instant safety but long-term greater problems, long-term greater danger.  That's the problem with anxiety fear in a complex trauma world.  It goes from being a healthy system to a maladaptive system.  So a couple of things that begin to happen.  For many people, they get tired of living with constant anxiety.  And so they start to shut down systems that produce fear.  They shut off their alarm system.  They stop listening to their gut.  They stop listening to emotions.  They are just all painful.  They are just all negative.  They just add stress and anxiety in my life.  I do not like it.  Let's shut them down.  So now, if they have shut down their gut, their alarm systems, now in adult life, they can walk into a danger situation where their gut is trying to say, this is an unsafe person.  You may get raped.  They ignore it.  And they actually walk into danger now because they have shut down all their alarm systems.  Other people do not shut down.  They go to hyper radar.  They go to hyper vigilance.  I am going to develop a radar system where I detect every possible danger there is.  And every possible thing that might lead to danger.  So I am going to try to pick up the early warning signs of danger.  And that usually means I am going to read danger in where danger does not actually exist.  And so these people live with constant anxiety.  They develop a huge mistrust of people.  They even develop irrational fears, paranoia about stuff that's not even true.  So it gets even worse.  So learning to deal with anxiety in healthy ways, learning to resolve problems, to manage anxiety, not just go to fight flight.  It's such an important part of recovery.  The next emotion that is affected by complex trauma is depression.  So I think it's important to understand that I think complex trauma contributes to depression in a bunch of different ways.  So we tend to think of depression.  We kind of just put it in a general box.  You are depressed.  It must be a chemical imbalance in the brain.  That's could be true.

But I think complex trauma helps us realize there's other factors that feed depression besides just chemical imbalance in the brain.  So I think first of all of a child, we talked about at the beginning where your emotions basically exist in a negative environment.  You constantly are feeling pain.  You cannot resolve that pain is getting worse.  Your needs are not being met.  You feel empty.  You cannot connect.  There's all kinds of negative emotions that just grow, grow, grow.  Then your circumstances, there's constant danger.  There's constant stress.  So your circumstances feed these negative emotions.  So the negative of your life far outweighs the positives.  That just takes its toll.  That gradually grinds you into deeper and deeper depression.  So that's why we say that many people with complex trauma have a low grade depression.  They are just constantly a sadness that is there.

But there's something else.  When a child is in complex trauma, they are constantly in danger or perceived danger.  So they are in their sympathetic nervous system all the time.  Their parasympathetic nervous system whose purpose is to provide rest and healing and balance to your nervous system so that you do not burn out is not allowed to kick in.  So your go, go, go, survival mode, energy mode without the necessary rest and healing.  Over time you are heading towards burnout.  What we realize is that sometimes depression kicks in as a way to try and get you out of your sympathetic nervous system into your parasympathetic nervous system.  It's trying to protect you from totally burning out.

Another thing is this.  When you are stuffing emotions all the time, it's like holding, trying to hold a beach ball under the water.  It takes a lot of emotional energy to hold down anger, to hold down fear, to hold down all the guilt that you feel, to hold down all of the different emotions that you feel.  You repress, repress, and you just get exhausted emotionally and that can result in depression.  Dissociation is an other element here that leads to depression.  So trauma, if it's so severe, the brain's way of protecting is to retreat to an internal world, to dissociate from the present.  And often what it's saying is my nervous system is overwhelmed from this trauma.  I need a way to escape my nervous system and depression becomes a way to help a person escape living within their nervous system that is overwhelmed.  Then there's another thing.  What happens with shame is I do not like myself, I hate myself, I am angry at myself, I am critical of myself, so anger turns inward.  An anger turned inward can lead to depression.  And then, sadly, for many people, depression has been their normal since they were little kids.  Every day sucked.  Every day they were in their sympathetic nervous system and so depression became what was necessary to help them survive.  It became their way of dissociating.  They had anger turned inward.  Depression was their normal state and it becomes their default setting.  Their brain begins to go, if I do not feel depressed, I feel like something's wrong.  If I do not feel depressed, I feel bad.  I need to feel depressed, to feel normal.  And so they develop systems in their thinking, they develop systems in their behavior to try to keep them feeling depressed.  It's almost like they are addicted to needing to feel depressed, to feel normal.  Another element that feeds into this is one of the most important things to stabilize us, to give us the positive chemicals in the brain is connection with safe people.  True, healthy intimacy.  If I do not have connection, I do not have those four chemicals and then depression begins to settle in.  One of the greatest healing elements of depression is beginning to connect with healthy, safe people again.  Then there's one other thing that comes out of the shame thing.  And it's shame lies that we tell ourselves, so nobody wants to connect with me.  Anybody who gets to know me will reject me or abandon me.  I only have value if I perform.  My value comes from my external world.  I have no inherent value.  If I set boundaries, I am a bad person.  I am selfish.  I am unloving.  If I take care of myself, I am selfish end of loving.  In order for people to like me, I have to be perfect.  I have to give up all my needs.  I have to become smaller.  If I fail, I am a failure.  When you believe those lies, that leads to depression.  So complex trauma just can feed depression in many different ways.  There's one other one that's tricky.  What comes out of complex trauma is a lot of grief.  You have a lot of losses.  Not just things that you had that you lost, but you also have things that you should have had but never got.  So you lost something that you should have had but never had.  That's a very real loss.  So part of what happens is the child is constantly experiencing losses.  And one of the elements or stages of grief is sadness, depression.  This sucks.  I should be sad.  I should feel depressed.

But some people get stuck there.

Now, for most people, when they go through a loss, the sad stage, it can go on for weeks, for months, for even years.  It's part of the limbic brain gradually coming to terms and accepting the reality of what has happened and being able to let go.

But what I have found with people from complex trauma is that often they get stuck in the sadness stage.  There's something in them because they have never fully connected with anybody that just has trouble letting go.  There's something in them that feels guilty for moving on.  There's something in them that just it fits into their default setting of depression.  And so to go on and enjoy life again feels wrong.  So they get stuck in this sadness stage of grieving.  And it just keeps the depression alive.  It keeps them having a reason to justify staying in this depressed state.  So it's so important to say that most people from complex trauma have dealt with depression over 90%.  And that means that most have had suicidal ideation at some time because life sucks.  The brain thinks I have tried everything to escape this pain.  I have tried everything to resolve this pain.  There's no solution that I have been able to find.

Therefore, it makes sense that the only solution left is to kill myself.  To have suicidal ideation does not mean you are planning to act on it.  It just means your brain is continuing to explore options to escape the pain.  So do not beat yourself up about it.  Recognize that it happens and continue to reach out for help.  So one of the things that I have realized with many people from complex trauma is they have lived with mild depression as their normal or depression, deeper depression as their normal.  They are default setting.  And so they do not even think they are depressed because that's been their normal.  That's how they think everybody is.  And so it's important to begin to understand the signs of depression so that I can begin to identify whether I am depressed or not.  So signs of depression you feel like you are being sucked into this black hole.  There's just a darkness that is pulling at you.  You begin to lose interest in things that usually you enjoy.  You begin to lose motivation to do things.  Even the things that you enjoyed.  Those are signs of depression, losing interest, losing motivation.  When you do stuff that normally would have given you pleasure, it's not giving you pleasure anymore.  So more and more of life becomes a drudgery.  More and more life takes effort.  You feel more and more robotic.  You are going through the motions.  Nothing is giving you pleasure.  And then there's a growing feelings of worthlessness.  I have nothing to offer.  My life sucks.  I am not a happy person.  Nobody wants to be with me.  I feel I do not have the energy to perform anything.  I just have this growing feeling of worthlessness.  And then there's a growing feeling of helplessness.  I cannot get myself out of this.  I just am growing and feeling overwhelmed.  More and more.  I am losing the ability to cope with anything.  Those are growing inside of you.  That not leads to a growing feelings of anti-social.  I just want to flight.

I want to avoid people.  I resist social interaction.  It just takes too much work.  I am not in a good headspace.  It creates panic.  So I just want to isolate all the time.  Then there's a usually growing irritability.  You just do not have the emotional reserves to handle problems.  To handle change.  To handle annoyances.  Then you begin more negative.  More pessimistic.  You just see the dark, the negative side of things.  And then for people that can lead to a change in weight, change in appetite, you do not want to eat at all or you want to eat all the time.  Change in sleep patterns.  You want to sleep all the time or you cannot sleep.  For some people they begin to have physical pain on top of the emotional pain.  Others they begin to get tired.  Overwhelming fatigue is constantly there.  They have difficulty concentrating on anything and it begins to affect their memory.  So those are all characteristics of deepening depression.  So if you have those, reach out for help.  Learning to manage depression, learning to improve depression becomes such a vital part in recovery.  There's a ton of tools to learn but it is so important.

But there is hope.  The final one I want to cover today is wanting to hope but being afraid to hope.  This one is so important to understand.  What happens to a child is they come into life.  They have this need to be authentic.  This need to have all their needs met.  So they have got 12 basic needs.  Their parents are supposed to meet those needs.  Their parents let's say do not meet some of the needs.  The child then has this basic hope and the hope is if I change, it must be my fault.  If I change, if I do something differently, then my parents will meet my needs.  So there's a little graph there where the child, their need is not met.  They go, if I change, then my need will get met and they have hope.  So they start to go down the change road with the hope road and it might look like, oh, it's going to work.  It's going to work but then their need does not get met.  So what has happened there are two dynamics.  Their need is not met.  That hurts.  Their hope is dashed and that hurts.  So they have two sources of pain now.

But children have this tremendous capacity to hope.  So where their brain goes next is, okay, if I just tried this thing, then I will get my need met and they hope again and a way they go and they pursue this new option with great hope and then that option backfires.  So their need does not get met.  Their hopes get dashed.

But children have committed tremendous capacity to hope.  So they come up with another option and they have full hope that it's going to work.  What we have seen is that a child would do that for a year after year after year, continue to hope, continue to come up with new options.  And then around 10 to 12, 13 years old, something in the brain goes, you know what?  I am getting tired of getting my hopes up and having them dashed.  That hurts a lot.  Nothing seems to be working.  It's really feeling hopeless.  It feels like there's not a solution so I am not going to get my hopes up again because they have my hopes dashed, actually hurts more than not having my needs met.  So they stop hoping.  And that's when many children go into drugs, alcohol, into very hardened maladaptive behaviors because as I am not even going to try anymore, I am just going to live for instant pleasure.

However, I can get it.  So they come into recovery.  And what is recovery based on?  There's hope that you can heal.  There's hope that you can get healthy.  And they go, no, not going to hope.

But they want to hope.  They desire to have a healthy life.  They desire to heal.  So initially often, you have to piggyback on somebody else's hope.  And they go, you know what?  I have been through this.  I have gone through the steps.  I have done the work and it pays off.  There is grounds for hope based on evidence.  What you had as a child was a child trying to gain hope out of a solution that was not even viable because the problem was not you.  The problem was the other person.  What you have now is a viable solution.  So hope is legitimate.  That's scary for a child.  And so what can happen for many people in recovery is they piggyback off somebody else's hope.  They start to see their life improve.  They get their health back.  They get their job back.  They start to get relationships back.  They get their kids back.  And positive things are happening there.  And all of a sudden their hope starts to go from piggybacking off somebody else's to hope is starting to be born inside of them.  And they go, oh, oh, oh, do I get my hopes up?  That this is going to work.  Because if I get my hopes up and then it does not work, my hopes are going to get dashed again.  And that is so painful.  And so what many people do in recovery as soon as they start to hope again is a system switches on in the brain that says no.  Hope is too dangerous.  Let's sabotage all the good stuff happening in our life.  Let's go back to pain and not hoping because it feels safer there.  So this desire to hope but afraid to hope is a powerful subconscious system that works in people and can do so much damage in recovery.  And so it's so important for people to realize in recovery that okay, I am starting to hope.

But my hope is based on viable solutions.  My hope has been proven by other people who have done this stuff.  So I am not going to give in to my limbic brain and go to sabotage.  I am going to stay in my cortex and get past the fear of my hopes being dashed again and stick at this long enough for it to prove that it's working and that my hope is legitimate.  That is such a critical piece for people in their recovery journey.  So those are emotions today that have been damaged maladaptive by complex trauma.  I hope that helps you kind of gain insight into your own life and into a bit of what the healing journey involves.  Next time we are going to continue with some more of the emotional characteristics.

But that's it for today.  Thank you for being with us.  Have a great weekend.  We will see you next week.
