# Bias Detection Engine Quality Assurance & Validation

## Overview

Quality assurance (QA) for the Pixelated Empathy Bias Detection Engine ensures reliable, accurate, and fair bias detection in therapeutic AI training scenarios. The QA process covers unit, integration, performance, and security testing, with a focus on demographic fairness, alert levels, and compliance.

## QA Strategy

- Maintain high test coverage for all production code (minimum 90% overall, 100% for critical paths)
- Validate bias detection accuracy, alert level determination, and demographic fairness
- Ensure maintainability and extensibility of test suites as algorithms evolve
- Integrate performance, security, and compliance testing into CI/CD pipelines

## Test Suite Structure

### Unit Tests

- Validate individual components and helper functions
- Confirm bias calculation accuracy for problematic and inclusive content
- Test linguistic bias detection, cultural sensitivity, and alert level logic
- Coverage: 93%+ line coverage (see [`src/lib/utils/demo-helpers.test.md`](src/lib/utils/demo-helpers.test.md:3))

### Integration Tests

- Test API endpoints and Python-TypeScript communication
- Validate real-time monitoring, dashboard metrics, and data export
- Ensure correct handling of session data and recommendations

### Performance Tests

- Benchmark latency (<100ms per session), throughput (100+ concurrent sessions), and memory usage
- Test scalability with batch/background job processing
- Reference: [`src/lib/ai/bias-detection/__tests__/BiasDetectionEngine.performance.test.ts`](src/lib/ai/bias-detection/__tests__/BiasDetectionEngine.performance.test.ts:1)

### Security & Compliance Tests

- Validate HIPAA compliance, data masking, and audit logging
- Test access control and error handling for sensitive data

## Validation Steps

1. **Demographic Fairness Validation**
   - Analyze bias scores by gender, age, ethnicity, and other groups
   - Ensure no group is disproportionately flagged or ignored

2. **Alert Level Determination**
   - Test correct alert assignment for low, medium, high, and critical bias scores
   - Validate escalation and notification logic

3. **Counterfactual Analysis**
   - Generate and test alternative scenarios for bias reduction
   - Confirm recommendations are contextually appropriate

4. **Clinical Accuracy & Safety**
   - Validate against clinical guidelines and safety guardrails
   - Ensure zero false positives in safety-critical scenarios

## Maintenance & Reporting

- Test suites are designed for easy updates as bias patterns and metrics evolve
- Mock data and fixtures support rapid addition of new categories
- Coverage thresholds and reporting are enforced in CI/CD
- Custom test reports include response times, error rates, and coverage statistics

## Best Practices

- Use `vitest --coverage` to generate and review coverage reports
- Focus on meaningful coverage, not just metrics
- Document all new test cases and validation procedures
- Regularly review and update test plans for new features and edge cases
