But last week we started a new series on codependency.  And what I said in that opening talk on that was, in my experience as an addictions counselor, one of the main causes of things that lead people to a relapse is they get into a relationship that is a codependent relationship.  And before we know it, they have become back into kind of addicted to a person.  And all of their addictive behavior and all of their old ways of doing things kick in.  And before you know it, they are all messed up inside and they end up relapsing to the drugs or alcohol.  So it is a huge issue that many in recovery have to deal with if they ever want to stay clean and sober.

But then I said beyond that, I do not think codependency is properly understood until people understand the complex trauma.  And that, to me, is significant because one of the symptoms of complex trauma is it sets people up to become codependent, which means it sets people up so that their relationships are not healthy and end up failing.  So that's why I want to do this series is because it's such a big issue for people in recovery.  It's one of the most common questions that I receive from clients when they are trying to recover.  And I think that's a big issue.  And I think that's a big issue.  And I think that's a big issue.  And I think that's a big issue.  And I think that's a big issue.  I think that's a big issue.  I think that's a big issue.  I think that's a big issue.  And so tonight I want to take it a little bit further.  And what I want you to understand up front is that when I say codependency, I have a spectrum in my mind.  So there is kind of mild codependency to severe codependency.  So you might say, I do not think I am codependent because I am not in the severe end of the spectrum.

But you might have some of the more mild parts of codependency that still can get you into a lot of trouble in a relationship.  So taking that, what I want to talk about tonight is the more severe end of the codependency spectrum.  And when you get to the more severe end of the codependency spectrum, a word comes into play that has become a very popular word, and it's called narcissism.  And so when you are in the more severe end of the codependency spectrum, there's usually a narcissist who's part of that relationship.

But what I want you to understand tonight is in order for a narcissist to be in a relationship, there's got to be a co-narcissist.  And I will explain that in a little bit.  And my hunch would be that most of you here would either fall in the category of a narcissist or a co-narcissist.

Now, they are supposed to be on the back of your handout, a test that you can take to see if you are a narcissist or a co-narcissist.  And then, so do not do that when I am talking, because I want you to listen.  And I do not want you all of a sudden getting super depressed or super angry or just stomping out because you are mad.  I did not invent the test.  It is produced by the American Psychological Society as what they use to measure narcissism and co-narcissism.  Okay, so let me.

Now, take that back to complex trauma.  What we have seen is that complex trauma is living in danger basically all the time.  So you are constantly in survival mode.  What happens when you are in survival mode is that you have to make your needs and your survival more important than the needs of others.  So you put yourself in a narcissistic place.  Okay?  Your needs now matter.  You now matter more than anything else in the world.

Now, what happens in one-event trauma is in survival mode, fight, flight, freeze, you put your needs and yourself ahead of everybody else until the danger passes, and then you come back down to feeling and acting equal to everybody, and you enter into loving relationships again where you value them and they value you just as much.  The tragedy of complex trauma, is you are constantly living in danger, so you are constantly living with you mattering more than anybody else.  So complex trauma sets you up to become a narcissist.  That's what you had to do to survive.

Now, I am not beating you up by saying that.  I am saying that's what survival mode that happens 24-7 looks like.  Your needs have to become more important than everybody else, so complex trauma is the birthplace of narcissism.  Okay?

Now, let me take that a little bit further.  The other effect of complex trauma is that the child is abused, abandoned, or neglected, and they conclude it's their fault.  So it develops shame.  So the greater the abuse, the greater the neglect, the greater the abandonment, the more it's a problem.  Okay?  The more the child takes home the message and personalizes that I must not matter at all, I must be totally unlovable, I must have zero value, and they develop this belief about themselves that they are not good enough, they are less than.  So the greater the trauma, the greater the shame.

Now, with that in mind, what I want you to understand is that narcissism is a response to severe shame.  So when a person is in a place where they feel totally like they are nothing because of severe trauma, they have severe shame, that is no fun to live with.  Who wants to walk around saying, I suck, I am useless, nobody, everybody should know I am totally unlovable and have zero value.  No, that is just way too depressing to live with.  That is just way too painful to live with.  So the brain begins to develop ways of trying to get rid of that.  So narcissism, to understand it correctly, it is the brain doing everything possible to either deny that it has any shame at all, or to overcompensate and feel that it does not have any shame, so it tries to disprove that there's any shame at all, and tries to prove that it has great value, that it is totally lovable, and it goes to the place that I am better than everybody.  So narcissism comes out of complex trauma as a response to severe trauma and severe shame.  That's what I want you to understand up front.  Now let me take it a bit further.  So response number one to severe shame is the narcissist.  I am better than everybody.  And the way I will make my life is that I will try to be the center of the universe.  And everybody needs to revolve around me because life is now going to be all about me.  So there you are, center of the universe.  Everybody is now in an orbit, around you, taking their cues from you about how they should act, what emotions they should show, and making sure that you are happy.  So that's how codependency begins.  Now what I want you to understand with that is that narcissism is like a big monster that needs to be fed all the time.  So a narcissist needs somebody adoring him all the time.  That's how he's fed.  So guess what that creates is what we call a co-narcissist or a mirror or an echo that reflects back to the narcissist.  You are wonderful.  I adore you.  You are such a beautiful person.  And the narcissist is getting fed.  So narcissists do not go into relationships with a healthy person who's not going to feed them.  They go look at them.  They are looking for a co-narcissist who will feed them and reflect back to them like a mirror how wonderful they are.  That is the co-narcissist narcissist thing.  Now what you have to understand about the co-narcissist is they walk around saying, I am awful.  I am terrible.  They do not try to compensate for their shame.  They give in to their shame.  And they are depressed.  They are feeling bad.  They are feeling terrible about themselves.  They hate themselves.  They live with that feeling all the time.  Guess what they want?  A narcissist to be the sun of their world who comes in and shines their light on them and says, I like you.

Let me help you.  I will fix you.  And they go, oh, I do have value.  This important person just noticed me and wants to help me.  And now you have the sun and the planet working beautifully together.  That is a narcissist and that is a co-narcissist.  Okay, let me take that a bit further.  So that goes beyond just the couple, okay?  So there you are, the sun of the universe.  Everything has to revolve around you.  The co-narcissist says, let me take care of your emotions.  You are sad.

Let me make you happy.  You are angry.

Let me fix your problems.  You are in trouble.

Let me make all your bad consequences go away.  And they give up all their rights.  They make all kinds of sacrifices to keep the sun of their universe happy because they cannot be happy unless the sun is happy.  And that's codependency, okay?

But it spreads beyond the couple to the family.  So now what you have is a narcissist who abandons and neglects and abuses everybody who does not give them what they want.  So they are this black hole that just sucks everything, but they are never satisfied.  And so the children get neglected because the narcissist is all wrapped up pursuing their selfish endeavors.  The children get abandoned or abused if they do not cooperate with the narcissist.  Well, children do not like living like that.  That's painful.  So children in their own mind are trying to solve the family problems that arise when a narcissist is the sun within the family system.  And so children will adopt different roles to try to fix the family and to try to make the narcissist happy.  And so each child will try different things as a way to solve their family problems and to try to get the narcissist to meet their needs and validate them and not neglect them or abuse them.  So that's where you get the child that says, I will be a hero.  I will be the perfect child.  I will never cause problems.  I will do extra chores.  I will get straight A's at school.  I will never get a fighter in trouble.  I will do all kinds of things extra around the house just to make everything run smoothly.  Trying to solve the problem.  Then you get the comedian child who says, there's a whole lot of pain in this family.  The way to solve it is to be funny and laughing all the time.  So I will be the jokester, the comedian, the storyteller, and I will make everybody happy.  And that will fix our family.  And then the invisible child says, I will have no needs.  I will fade into the background.  I will never ask for anything.  I will hide out in my room so that I do not add any extra stress to this family because it is not in a good place.  So each child can try different ones.  They can try all three.  Most will settle in on one.

But what they are going to find as they get older is it did not fix the thing.  The narcissist was not happy.  The narcissist did not meet their needs.  The narcissist did not validate them.  And they took it personally and developed their own shame and said, it's my fault.  I am the problem.  And that creates the next generation of codependent people.  Okay, so that's how it begins.  Now I am going to give you a very psychological analysis tonight to see if you are a narcissist.  Okay?  So if you were to go to the DSM or the diagnostic manual that is used to determine narcissists and look through the literature around how can you tell if a person's a narcissist, you would come up with these 18 criteria.  You do not have to meet all 18, but you got to meet at least half of them, okay?  So here we go.  A narcissist, if you do not know what a narcissist, where it comes from, let me quickly give you the back story.  It comes from a Greek myth.  So back in a long time ago in Greece, before there were ever mirrors, you never saw a reflection of yourself.  And so one day this guy named narcissist, he goes out to get a drink of water at the pond.  And it's nice and calm that day and the sun's shining just right and he looks into the pond to get a drink of water and he sees his reflection.  And he goes, that is the handsomest guy I have ever seen in my life.  I fall in love with you.  I am coming back every day just to look at myself and admire myself and how beautiful I am.  That's where narcissism came from.  That's the idea, okay?  So number one, they believe they are special and unique, which means they think they are a little bit better than everybody else.

But the reason we say they think they are special is they think they can only be understood by special people.  So what that means is if you call them on your stuff, they have a comeback that says, you do not get me because you are not special.  Only the right people understand my greatness.  So they have that system in their mind.  Second thing, deep down, they may not say it, they might say it, but they do believe they are more important than other people.  That they are smarter, more capable, better in every category almost.  Next, they exaggerate their achievements.  So they did not just catch a fish this big, they catch a fish this big, right?  So you get that kind of thing.  That kind of exaggeration that takes place.  And they expect to be recognized by you as being better than you.  So they expect you to look up to them and kind of adore them and stand in awe of how great they are.  In their private fantasy mind, they have fantasies about how powerful they are and how powerful they are going to be and how successful they are and how attractive they are.  And they can sometimes play in their mind, that person said hi to me today.  They must be in love with me.  And they can just start playing with that in their mind and developing a fantasy that everybody loves them because everybody said hi to them.  And that's where they go.  Like I said, they have an insatiable appetite for attention, praise, and admiration.  They always are looking for a pat on the back for validation.  Now I am not saying you should never give people a pat on the back, because we should.  That's part of being healthy.  You validate people on what they are doing.  A narcissist just wants it constantly.  They are always looking for it.  And then in their own mind, they think everybody's jealous of them.  They think everybody wishes they could be like them.  And that, again, is in their own deluded fantasies.  A key thing to understand about narcissists is they are all about image.  So they do not feel good enough inside, but they will never admit that.  So they base all of their value on their image.  So their focus is looking good.  So they do that through a couple things.  They associate with a high status person.  So if you are a very good-looking woman and you have been with a narcissist, at some point you have wondered, I think I am just a trophy on his arm.  That he wants me on his arm because I make him look good.  He does not really care about me.  He just cares that I make him look better than if he did not have me.  So that's what narcissists do.  And then if it's not a woman, then they want to say, I know the president of this, and I know the president of that.  And they drop names, and they try to hang out and go for coffee with very influential people because it makes them look good.  Then they try to control how you think about them.  So if they do something that maybe was not appropriate, they now will send you emails to explain away what they did and to tell you what you should conclude about them.  So they put a lot of energy into managing their image and trying to control how other people think of them.  Then arrogance, or they are just, their nose is a little bit in the air, a bit of snobbishness is there.

Now, if you have been in a relationship with a narcissist, you will understand this next one.  They must never, they must never be wrong.  Because their image says you, they always have to be right.  So if you are in a conflict with a narcissist, they will never admit they are wrong, but rather, they will take what happened and twist it to make you wrong.  And they will take what you say and twist it to make you wrong.  So what I say to people, do not argue with a narcissist, because the more you try to convince them of your truth, the more they are going to twist what you say and use it against you.  Because they must never be wrong.  And then, at first a narcissist can act very caring, but as their true colors come out, you find they do not really have much empathy or care for other people's needs or feelings at all.  Rather, they are, it's all about me, causes them to feel very entitled.  That you owe me special treatment.  You have to meet all of my needs.  I do not have to meet any of your needs.  So a relationship with a narcissist is never giving 50-50.  It's always lopsided.  You are doing the majority of the giving, they are doing all the getting.  And that is their sense of entitlement.  Then, they do not think rules apply to them.  So they live by a double standard.  Rules apply to you, but not to me.  I can go through your phone, you cannot go through mine.  So rules do not apply to them.  They are the exception in their mind to every rule.  Do not know how you are scoring yourself so far, but I will keep going.  What I mean by they are exploitive of others is this.  Narcissists are people who are all about manipulating you to meet their needs.  Narcissists do not know how to love people, they just know how to use people.  Now in their minds, they are being loving.  Because they are giving, they are kind in their early days.

But what they are really doing is grooming you.  They are giving to get.  They are playing a long game where I will give, give, give, give, till I have got past their defenses, and their guards, and they trust me, and then I will get.  So that is the manipulation that happens inside of a narcissist.  Now to help you understand that, when a person has a lot of shame deep down that they have never acknowledged, they are pretty sure that if people get to know them, nobody will ever want to meet their needs.  So the only way they can get their needs met is not to express them, but to learn how to manipulate them.  And so narcissists become master manipulators.  They can get so good at manipulating, sometimes you are not even aware that they are manipulating you.  Usually there's always a hidden agenda that's happening when you are working with a narcissist, and when you first meet a narcissist and they say, tell me about yourself, and you pour out your heart, and tell them about you, and tell them everything about yourself, guess what they are doing?  They are taking notes.  Oh yes, here's where I can manipulate them.  I got their hot button.  Now I know what to use if I want to get something badly.  They are taking notes on you.  They must feel control, and they must always get what they want.  Now this is important to understand from this perspective.  Narcissists can be the sweetest, nicest people in the world, 99% of the time, until they do not get what they want.  And then you got World War III.  They explode, and there is hell to pay to anybody who has crossed them.  So what I am saying is this.  Narcissists can act very healthy until they are triggered.  And it's those triggers that reveal their true colors.  They can no longer hide their deeper stuff once they get triggered.  The masks come away, and they come out.  So some of the main triggers for a narcissist are perceived rejection.  So if you reject them or say no to them, watch out.  Not getting what they want, not getting enough attention.  You are not feeding me enough, or anything that messes with their image.  So what happens if they do not get what they want, or they get triggered?  Usually they go to anger, and then they get cruel, abusive, they lash out, they say extremely hurtful things, and they can be very destructive.  Just that one trigger can set off a whole lot of painful things, and they can do that, and not even have a conscience about it.  So you often do not know a person's a narcissist until one of their triggers get triggered.  And then their true colors will come out.  Another characteristic of a narcissist, because they always have to be fed, is they have a lot of jealousy issues.  What happens in an extreme narcissist is this.  If you are in a relationship with them, the only way they can be convinced that they are the son of the universe is that there's nobody else in the universe but you.  So they get rid of all your friends, they get rid of your family, and they demand your full attention.  And they are jealous if you talk to anybody else, if you go to an activity somewhere.
