You tend to reenact old dynamics.  So you are attracted to a narcissist, you put up with red flags and stuff in the relationship that you should not, and pretty soon you are back into a narcissistic relationship.  Well, welcome to another little chat with Tim.

I want to do a little mini series, short chats on some more narcissism stuff.  I have done talks on narcissism in the past that I have really tried to explore it in depth, but I just wanted to add a few things that I have picked up over the years that I thought I would put into short videos.  Today I would like to talk about what's the results of being in a relationship with a narcissist for a period of time?  How does it affect the person?  And this could be, being in an intimate relationship where there's a partner, a husband, a wife, whatever, or it could be a parent or grandparent that you were in a relationship with for years, or it could be a boss or a religious leader that claims to represent God, and then you do all you can to please them and have a relationship with them as your pastor or leader.  How does that affect you?  And I would say there's a real good chance that you have complex trauma or complex PTSD as a result of that.  Because what happens when you are in a relationship with a narcissist is that you are always on guard, you are always feeling a certain element of lack of safety or danger or something might happen.  And over time, that begins to take its toll and you get complex trauma.

Now, some of you might get, you know, a little bit resistant to that and go, yes, I do not think that's going to, that's what happened to me.  And so what I would like to do today is just to give you a very basic test that you can apply to yourself, hopefully with an open mind, just to see if these characteristics apply to you.  And then at the end, we will talk a little bit more about it.  So what are the indicators that a person has complex PTSD?  And if you come out of a relationship with a narcissist, you are going to be in a relationship with a narcissist.  And you are going to be in a relationship with a narcissist.  And you have these characteristics, then you go, okay, where did these characteristics come from?  So the first is just basically you have been exposed to actual or threatened violence.  And that could be, you have been threatened that they are going to hurt you or kill you or sexually violate you, or you have witnessed somebody else being threatened or something bad happening to them.

But you have been in an environment of threats of actual violence.  And you have been exposed to violence, of actual violence as part of that relationship.  And then some of the emotional and psychological results that would come out of that would be hypervigilance that you have never had before.  So now you are always looking for danger, scanning the environment, the horizon, feeling like you are walking on eggshells.  And that can go on even after the relationship has ended.  And then you have recurrent, involuntary, intrusive memories of events that happened.  They just pop into your head.  Or you have emotional flashbacks.  So suddenly something's happening in your life today that triggers all this flood of emotions.  And they are all negative emotions, fear, worthlessness, shame, panic, all of that gets triggered and comes rushing in.  And always the result is that there's an increased shame so that you have a lower self image.  Deep down you do not feel anybody would want you.  You feel anybody that gets to know you is going to abandon you or reject you.  You feel like you are too much or you are not enough or you are just unlovable.  Those lies have just deepened in their beliefs in you.  Their intensity in you as a result of this relationship.  And then there's a persistent guilt that follows you around.  So you hear all of the words of the narcissist in your head.  Their criticisms, their blame, all the things they tried to make your fault.  And you are wondering if maybe they were right.  That it's somehow your fault.  That somehow you should have been able to fix it.  If only you had tried more things.  You probably could have fixed it.  So there's just this nagging guilt all the time.  And then there's what we would call identity erosion.  You are not sure anymore who you are.  You do not know who you are apart from the relationship.  You have kind of absorbed the narcissist's view of you that you are nothing without them.  That you cannot do anything right.  That they, you cannot think properly.  You do not know who they are.  They do not seem to care about what you do.  They are not your friends.  They do not think about what you do.  They come to you on everybody's wait order.  They are suspected of raisinghando you for broken an ent justification.  Then of course, fear Kesha.  Fear Kesha can make you want to break in and get back together this way for god's sake.  They have all got the same engravings for you.  And what this inner fear word is like, here's what we make up.  It's totally perverse here.  Fear Kesha comes infuriating you for of a falseNA.  Fear Kesha is going, what are you doing?  Fear Kesa lets you meet that way.  Fear Kesha has solid faith.  Fear Kesha is growing stronger.  Fear Kesha is twice spicy.  Fear Horse.  Fear Kesha is more strong.  Value you.  And then you find you have difficulty trusting.  The narcissist has caused you to distrust everybody.  And so now when you meet new people, you just assume they are going to manipulate you, betray you, abandon you, use you.  So trust has been terribly damaged.  And then you find you just have this deep, deep anger inside for all that you have been through, the mistreatment, for not being seen, for your needs not being met, for being betrayed, all of those things.  There's just this deep, deep anger and it often shows up in a lot of irritability.  And then at times you are just going to be hit with a deep grief that you just miss this person so much.

But you have not just lost this person.  Sometimes the grief is all the wasted years with this person, all the lost opportunities.  And then there's going to be a real conflicted emotions inside where at one moment you just hate this person, the other moment you love them and want to get back with them.  And so you are just this torn sense inside of you of love, hate at the same time.  And then at times there's just this, this wanting to hope that maybe there is a way to fix the relationship, a way that maybe you could get back together.  That's still, it's like a flickering candle, but it's still there.  And then you are going to find some cognitive indicators.  So intrusive thoughts.  So your brain's going to replay arguments that you had with the person, cruel words that they said to you, demeaning incidents.  They put you down, they embarrassed you.  They made you feel terrible.  That's just going to pop into your head periodically.  And then lots of self doubt and confusion.  So you question your own perception of thing.  You question your sense of reality.  You question your ability to think for yourself.  All of that's the results of the gaslighting that has taken place by the narcissist for years.  And now you, you find you just still have trouble thinking for yourself and believing your own perceptions of things, even trusting your gut.  And so that leads to difficulty making decisions because your fear of making the wrong decision, your fear that you are not smart enough to make a good decision, your fear you are going to get punished if you make the wrong decision.  And then you might have some memory issues that crop up.  So you have the inability to remember some of the things you do not properly remember that we could agree with.  There are a lot of the KPIs, and you are actually driving a to the çık now you are driving a car, so drive yourself back to the gut.  Just растравляing, getting into the impatientности of the unconscious heart.  All of this makes you feel deeper, frame like that.  You identify the sense of sharpness and learnerism of having lost a topic you were approaching.  It's true to say, you know what?  When you are having some, you have a vague idea or you have chills, want to stay distracted.  Sitting quietly, that makes stuff too uncomfortable for you.  And then there's some behavior indicators.  Many begin to want to isolate.  It's like they just do not want to be around people, either because they are afraid that people are judging them or what they have been saying behind their back, cannot look people in the eye, so it's just easier to stay away.  Or they are afraid they are going to get attacked.  They are going to get these long, I told you so sermons, and it's just going to be more painful.  Or they are just too tired.  They are depressed.  They just do not want to deal with people.  And so they just, it's easier to isolate.  Some go to people pleasing.  So they know that these friends and family have been warning them about this person for years, and they have ignored it.  And now they just want to get rid of people.  They just want to get rid of people.  So they just want to get rid of people.  And now they get back with these friends and family so they go over the top to try to please them to be whatever they want them to be to avoid conflict with them and again they are going back to just old survival tools to try and keep themselves safe because of all that's happened some just go to avoid avoid so you steer clear of any reminders of the narcissist any conflict any intimate relationships because it's just easier to avoid all the things that stir up pain than to deal with the pain and then dysregulated responses so you are going through a day you have been very calm very much operating out of a very healthy place in your brain and then something triggers an emotion in you fear anger shame and you just lose it you and you go from zero to 100 in a nanosecond and you lash out and you just cannot stop those emotions once they start to happen and that happens periodically and then there's some physical or somatic indicators so you find that there's a lot of kind of chronic tension muscle tightness that results in headaches stomach issues it's like all of that tension over the last years was stored in your body and now your body's starting to talk to you that can also result in sleep disturbances so you have nightmares or you just cannot sleep or you have difficulty sleeping you fall asleep but then you wake up and then cannot fall back to sleep some are even afraid to fall asleep because they are afraid of the nightmares that are going to come most go through great exhaustion chronic fatigue adrenal fatigue their body is just headed it's burnt out and that can go on for months after coming out of the relationship and then others find that they have just physical pain all of a sudden they are just aware that they hurt in different parts of their body and then there's relationship indicators that you might see so you make friends with new people but now you find this intense fear of abandonment that they are probably going to abandon me once they start to get to know me and that just becomes consuming and that can lead to jealousy issues or sabotaging relationships or you tend to reenact old dynamics so you are attracted to a narcissist you put up a with red flags and stuff in the relationship that you should not and pretty soon you are back into a narcissistic relationship most struggle with boundaries because with a narcissist you could not have any boundaries so now they go to either very rigid boundaries or not at all they just do not know how to set boundaries how to enforce boundaries how to say no and so boundaries is a huge issue and then they just find they become quite emotionally numb so they have difficulty feeling joy they have difficulty getting close to anybody just showing warmth affection there's just a flatness a roboticness about them it's just like their emotions have shut down so how did you do those are some of the indicators of complexion complex trauma complex PTSD and so if those were true of you after you have come out of a relationship with a narcissist I am not surprised because what I want you to see is that a narcissist does not know how to provide safety does not know how to meet needs for another person does not know how to connect with another person and so the other person always feels lack of safety due to the disconnection they feel lack of safety because the other person is not meeting their needs narcissists create complex trauma environments and the longer you stay in it the greater the effect on you and it takes its toll so if you realize wow I have complex PTSD because of my relationship with the narcissist please get help you will benefit so much from getting help with a therapist with taking a course like our lift course to really help you begin to deal with all that stuff and the ramifications are huge but I want to leave you with one final thing to think about if you have complex trauma today because of a relationship of a narcissist I want you to consider the fact that that's actually a symptom that you probably have complex trauma from earlier in childhood that set you up to be attracted to a relationship with a narcissist to be unable to walk away from all the red flags that you saw not listen to your gut when you first met the narcissist so you were set up earlier in life with complex trauma that made you vulnerable to being having it repeated with a narcissist today you need help with that as well I hope this helps you if this is true of you that you go wow I need to get some help here you.
