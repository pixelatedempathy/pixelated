## ü§ù **COLLABORATION & DECISION POINTS**

### **Immediate Questions for Team**
1. **Scope prioritization**: Focus on depth (fewer experts, more detail) vs. breadth (more experts, basic extraction)?
2. **Quality thresholds**: What confidence score should trigger human review of extracted concepts?
3. **Expert permissions**: Do we need consent from living experts (Dr. Ramani, Gabor Mat√©) for voice pattern analysis?
4. **Cultural sensitivity**: How do we handle religious vs. secular therapeutic approaches (Tim Fletcher's dual versions)?

### **Resource Requirements**
- **Compute**: Knowledge extraction is CPU-intensive, may need parallel processing
- **Storage**: Knowledge base could reach 1GB+ with full extraction
- **Validation**: Budget for licensed clinician review time ($2000-5000)
- **Legal**: Review intellectual property considerations for expert content
