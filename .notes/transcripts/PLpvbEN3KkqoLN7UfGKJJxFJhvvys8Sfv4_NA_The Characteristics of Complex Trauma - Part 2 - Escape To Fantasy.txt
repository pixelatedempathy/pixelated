## Transcript

 Well, welcome again to another Friday night and last week we started a new series looking  at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma in more detail.  And we started by looking at perfectionism and tonight I want to come to escape to fantasy.  Most or many of the clients that I work with would not see this as one of their characteristics  initially.  Well, once they begin to understand it, many go, wow, I didn't even realize I did that.  And this is a really significant issue for me to look at.  And that's really what I want to do today is just help you better understand what we mean  when we talk about escaping to fantasy, why people from complex trauma do it, and what  healthy looks like.  So let me begin with the definition.  It's said to be a self protective coping mechanism used by many abuse victims.  It's a way of mentally or emotionally leaving the situation or spacing out to enter a fantasy  world.  And this often helps to anath the size the person by relieving their present pain.  So it's a way of escaping out of pain and feeling better.  That's what it is.  But it's also something that becomes addictive and obsessive.  And so when a person becomes addicted to this escape through fantasy, it often is very hard  for them to let go, much more difficult than they expected it to be.  So another way just to say that is a person is escaping something painful and that could  be their circumstances, but it could also be themselves and we're going to develop that.  Or it could be painful emotions that they're wanting to escape.  And so it's trying to make all these negative feelings go away and replace them with positive.  And so fantasy becomes their way of doing that.  Let me give you a couple examples just so you understand what I'm talking about and  how broad this whole topic is.  So we live in a day of internet dating.  And for many people they meet somebody online and without really getting to know the person  at all, they begin to develop a fantasy of this person where they're madly in love with  them, this person's madly in love with them.  And it becomes this relationship that there's nothing in reality that is actually happening.  But in the fantasy world, it is developing into this wonderful relationship with a wonderful  person.  That happens.  Some people, as younger people, or even adults, still escape to fantasy about becoming  somebody great, a movie star, the most popular person in the class, the one that everybody  wants to date.  And the fantasy world is where they escape to feeling important and feeling loved.  Some people, when they go through sexual abuse, they're escaped out of their body like  experience so that they're not even conscious of it happening to them.  It sometimes feels like it's happening to somebody else.  Some people escape into fantasy within the world of religion.  And they go into the world of religion thinking that it will magically fix their marriage,  their addiction, their children.  And so the religion and the magic of the religion is a fantasy fix.  So they don't have to work at anything, it will just fix it for them.  I had a client ten years ago and I taught about escaping to fantasy and at first he didn't  even think that was an issue for him.  But then over the next days, as he thought about it, he realized that the minute he stepped  out of his apartment to go for a walk downtown or go pick something up, he checked out of  the present and escaped into this world of fantasy the entire time he was walking.  And it was always this wonderful world where everything went well.  And when he saw that, he was actually quite shocked and scared by how big of a thing  it was in his life.  Or let's say you meet Mr. Wright.  And Mr. Wright is your night in shining armor.  They're just so kind and wonderful to you and you just fall head over heels in love even  though everybody around you who knows that Mr. Wright is saying he's Mr. Wrong.  And you conclude they're all wrong, you're the only one that's got it right.  Mr. Wright is perfect.  Or you can have a boy growing up in a home where he's not love or he doesn't feel like  he belongs.  And so he is attracted to gang life.  There it looks like everybody loves each other and respects each other there.  He's made to feel like he fits in and belongs and this is his family.  And he creates this fantasy of the wonderful family he will have in gang life.  Mark can even go into more subtle stuff like a mother or a father who is not present  to their children because they're on their phone on social media looking up stuff on  the internet, shopping, escaping into their fantasy world.  Denzel Washington has said this, beware of destination addiction.  So that's one type of fantasy type addiction.  The idea that happiness is in the next place, the next job or even the next partner until  you give up the idea that happiness is somewhere else, it will never be where you are.  So very well said.  Let me read something that somebody wrote.  Starting on fantasy, daydreaming as escapism, I suffer from avoidant personality disorder  as well as depression, low self-esteem and over the past couple of years, a way that I  have dealt with it is to use fantasy.  I started off with occasionally imagining myself as a different person and daydreaming about  being in positive situations, but over the years, the fantasies have become more detailed.  With the person I imagine having a totally different name, life, etc.  It's gotten to the point where I imagine these fantasies every single day and have trouble  sleeping if I'm not imagining myself as this other person.  I'm fully aware that it's all fantasy, but the degree that I've come to rely on it scares  me and I've never heard of anyone else with this kind of problem.  I'm afraid to talk to a therapist about it because I'm afraid of what he or she would  think of me, signed dreamer.  So hopefully those examples help you understand what I'm talking about by this escapity fantasy.  And hopefully if you do that yourself, you've been able to identify some of the times that  you do escape into this fantasy world.  I need to say up front that there are healthy escapes into fantasy.  They're not all unhealthy.  So let me just give you examples of healthy escapes into fantasy.  All of us young, old, we still go into our imaginations and we imagine a different world.  We imagine how things could be better.  That can be a very healthy activity.  Children love to use their imaginations.  They love to make forts, have tea parties, dress up and imagine that they're somebody  else.  They love to write stories of imagination.  And that can be a very helpful thing for them in developing their brains, in developing  their minds and their outlook on life.  If you look at our culture today, we escape into watching sports.  And some would even imagine when they played that sport.  We escape into movies and we go on Netflix marathons.  We escape into novels, books that take us to some other place.  And that can be a very healthy thing as part of self-care.  We also make plans for our future.  We have dreams about what we would one day like to do, where we would one day like to live.  And that can be a healthy thing.  Sometimes, when we're struggling with very frustrating, difficult circumstances, when  life is hard, when we're struggling with depression, we can escape by going back to what life  was once like.  And we can say, you know what, this too will pass.  We will one day have things better again.  And it's a way of counteracting the negative thinking, the depression that wants to take  us into a more morbid point of view by saying, no, this is what we can get to again.  So there is a healthy type of escape.  What makes it unhealthy is when it interferes with a couple of things.  Number one, it interferes with the individual's ability or willingness to take responsibility  for their own actions.  So instead of doing anything about their problems, they escape into reality.  And then that just makes it so they don't feel they need to deal with their problems.  It interferes with taking responsibility.  It interferes with making realistic decisions in real time, important decisions about their  future, about how to resolve situations.  So it's a way of avoiding.  And so it has been classified as not just kind of flight or avoidance.  In some cases, it's denial of the problem.  In some cases, it's dissociation from yourself, from the pain, from your circumstances.  So it has some very scary type of tendencies.  But bottom line, it's unhealthy if it results in me not dealing with life on life's terms  by avoiding life.  The other fact about it is it's relying on emotions, not facts, to make decisions.  So this makes me feel good, so I will pursue that.  I will choose that, instead of looking at the facts, I will just chase the feeling.  So why do people escape into this fantasy world?  I think for the vast majority of people who do so, complex trauma is at the core of it.  It's really what it's all about.  And so you need to understand the complex trauma piece to really appreciate this style of coping.  And the issue in complex trauma is a child is in circumstances that aren't fair, that are  painful, that aren't safe, and they're trying to fix them, but mum and dad aren't allowing  that to happen, or the teacher at school isn't allowing that to happen.  So there's no way for them to solve their own problems, doesn't matter what they try,  it doesn't improve their situation, they remain in ongoing pain.  And so the brain is looking for ways to escape that problem-filled life since nothing healthy  is working.  And so one of the things that the brain comes up with for some people is escaping into  a fantasy world.  So it's all about a child's inability to resolve the difficult circumstances and the  most painful emotions of their life.  So if you take that and then look at what this fantasy world looks like for that child,  it's a world where they feel safe and happy all the time, where they don't have any fear,  they don't have any pain.  It's a world where everybody loves them, where everybody treats them and each other with respect.  It's a world where all their needs are met.  It's a world where they had power, where they weren't powerless.  It's the nature of the fantasy world that they create.  Now I should say this, for people in extreme abuse, the brain has tried everything to  relieve the abuse to make the situation better and nothing has worked.  And the abuse is so severe that the brain just takes over in trying to protect the child  and it will actually dissociate from the events that are around that child so that  the child can have an out-of-body experience, they can be like they're on the ceiling looking  down and that's happening to somebody else, or they can escape to some place that it  is safe.  But it's a subconscious thing, they're not consciously doing it.  The brain just does it as a last ditch effort to protect this child and that begins your  dissociative disorders.  But let's go back to a person that escapes of their own choice to a fantasy world.  What you need to understand is that their current situation is creating a lot of negative  emotions and pain in their limbic brain.  And so what the brain is wanting to do is find something that will overpower the negative  limbic brain emotions with positive emotions instantly.  And so escaping to a fantasy world is a way to take all those positive emotions and make  them feel like they're happening and overpower the negative emotions of their current situation.  And then it goes further.  What else comes out of complex trauma is this shame piece where I don't feel good enough.  My identity says, I am not lovable, I am not valuable, so I live with the pain of constant  shame.  I don't like myself.  And in some cases, I hate myself.  And so now people escape to fantasy so they don't have to live in their own skin.  So they can imagine a different them where everybody loves them.  And then beyond that, in complex trauma, you have many needs that aren't met.  And so in the fantasy, you are getting your needs met.  And so if you grow up with injustice, where things aren't fair, where one child is favored  over the other, where dad doesn't care about justice just about what he wants, then you  can have revenge fantasies.  You can imagine yourself being able to execute justice and vengeance on all the people who  are perpetrating injustice.  And then you create this environment where you're respected and loved unconditionally,  where you connect with people where you fit in and belong.  And that is getting your needs met.  So complex trauma introduces a whole bunch of different things that all involve painful  emotions as the consequence.  And so escaping to fantasy becomes a critical piece in many different ways to survive for  a person in complex trauma.  And so if it's about getting needs met, what can then happen in the person's mind is they  begin to think that the fantasy is the solution to their problems.  If only I had that, then life would be good.  If only I had this, then I would be happy.  And so now your fantasy is causing you to believe certain things that are probably lies.  So let me take it further.  Complex trauma means ongoing pain, ongoing danger, ongoing unmet needs.  And so a person then escapes the fantasy on a regular basis in order to have positive  emotions in order to survive.  And so they begin to get to a point where they don't want to live in the present at all because  it's constantly painful.  A large part of their brain is now used to explore their fantasy world to live there and  it is more enjoyable than their present.  And now they do it without even realizing they do it.  And it can become their default setting.  They go there now, subconsciously, they go there all the time because they've been there  for so long.  So that's kind of why it develops.  Now let me take it a bit further to show some of the negative consequences that start  happening the longer the person uses escaping the fantasy as a coping mechanism.  So they, as we have said, begin to think that maybe their fantasies can become reality.  And they don't realize that their fantasies contain lies.  To them, their fantasy feels so real.  And so just for example, a person who is lonely and sad begins to fantasize about having  a little puppy and it just fills their heart with warmth, with love.  And they begin to think, if only I have a puppy, I will be happy.  And they're convinced it is true.  They don't see some of the lies that are part of that fantasy.  And so their fantasy becomes the magical solution to all of their problems.  So it's a new puppy, it's a new car, it's a new partner, it's a new job, it's a new  neighborhood, it's a more travel, it's better clothes, it's more money.  These, this is going to be the magic solution because in their fantasy it is.  And they get very distorted in their thinking about reality.  Now one thing I want you to think about is this, fantasy, if you look at it, can contain  for some an element of narcissism.  So what is it in the fantasy is they have all the power.  Everybody adores them.  They are able to get all their needs met all the time.  And so without realizing it for some, they picture themselves this way but really they're  a narcissist.  And they're thinking that being a narcissist is what will make them happy.  And that can be very dangerous.  Further, it causes them to put on rose colored glasses.  They no longer see people accurately, they see them through their fantasy.  And if they think this person is going to love them and fix all their problems, they  now see the person through the eyes of fantasy and don't see them accurately and they can  get connected to somebody who is a narcissist who will become very abusive.  And then they get mad at people who try to burst their bubble, who try to get them to see  reality.  And so what you see is they now want to see through rose colored glasses.  They want their fantasy to be true more than anything even if it means denying reality.  And that is scary.  Some keep chasing fantasies of magic and never do the hard work of life.  They never accept responsibility to make decisions to better their life.  They keep chasing the next magic fantasy.  And they can do that for years.  So here's what I want you to see.  Finding fantasy can become self-destructive.  The longer you stay in fantasy, the more distorted you get and the more you ultimately do damage  to yourself and to others.  Yes, it makes you feel good in the moment, but it is starting to create lots of negative  consequences.  There is a study, or some studies that have been done that suggest that escapism, people  that escape to fantasy are often depressed and that's kind of what we've been talking about.  But the longer they stay in fantasy and not deal with their life, the more depressed  they get.  And so it starts with depression, but then it feeds even greater depression.  More than that, what they have seen in other studies is that people who are attracted  to psychopaths and narcissists are often people with a high tendency to escape to fantasy.  Because a narcissist and a psychopath, they are very charming up front.  They are very good at manipulating people and making them think they're loved when they're  only being used.  And so people with a high level of escaping to fantasy have a greater risk of being attracted  to psychopaths and narcissists.  So bottom line again, escaping to fantasy, yes, gives you instant gratification, but  man does it result in a lot of pain and heartache down the road.  Now the next thing I want you to think about is an understanding yourself.  If escape to fantasy has been something that you do, what triggers it today?  What would cause you today to go into a fantasy world?  So let me just give you a couple of things.  Stress, frustration, conflict, problems, pain, anger, anxiety, painful emotions.  And then, outside of those more intense emotions, discontent, boredom, loneliness.  In other words, any negative emotion in the limbic brain can trigger your escape to fantasy.  Besides that, any time oxytocin is released in your brain.  You meet somebody and you fall in love.  That releases oxytocin and that can trigger you to go into a fantasy about that person.  So what that basically says is you can get triggered to go into your fantasy many times  a day whenever you feel negative emotions or even positive emotions.  So study yourself to become aware of your triggers.  Okay, let me take you to healthy tools.  So you understood the problem.  What does healthy look like?  So Dane and Category wrote this.  You cannot find any peace by escaping from human pain and suffering.  You have to find peace and harmony right in the midst of human pain.  In other words, you got to face reality.  There's no pleasure, there's no peace by escaping.  It's only by dealing with your present reality.  So face reality, commit yourself to base your decisions on reality.  Now if you decide to do that, know this.  Reality sometimes feels very cruel.  So Mr. Charming, you find out is really a jerk and you have to say no to that and set  boundaries that and it just seems so cruel to have to deny yourself that.  And you don't like the facts, they go against your emotions and what your emotions want  to believe.  But know this in the long term, you will be glad you went with reality.  So whenever you're looking at a circumstances or your emotions or your life, discipline  yourself or develop the practice of separating fact from fiction.  What is truth, what is a lie?  What is fact, what is fantasy?  Identify the fantasy lies that you have believed, the magic ones, the denial type ones.  Now you might need to have a friend who's going to help you with this and they're going  to do kind of reality checkups with you about whether you're facing reality accurately,  straightforward, honestly, or whether there's some fantasy mixed in.  Another thing that you might find helpful is if you think you have a fantasy type belief  or something you do, write it down.  And often in writing it down, you can see really kind of more objectively, but you can  see how crazy it can be or just how wrong, how out of touch with reality it is.  Next, as you get to know your triggers, then learn to catch yourself.  At the times you slip into fantasy.  So you catch yourself, oh, I'm going to fantasy, stop yourself, don't feed into the fantasy.  And so what you're doing is you're blocking all of the access points to your fantasy world  so that you more and more train yourself to live in reality.  So know that this is a slow process.  You're not going to do this perfectly overnight.  If you slip into fantasy, don't beat yourself up, but ask yourself, what are you trying  to avoid?  Because that's what triggered you.  And once you've identified that, then you go, okay, I've been wanting to have a better,  healthier life.  And so this situation here is what's causing me to be triggered and wanting to escape.  What could I do to better the situation?  What could I do to improve the situation?  What actual steps can I take?  So very practical stuff.  But don't forget to have healthy escapes as part of self-care so that you work hard, you  face reality, and then you go, you know what, I'm going to take a couple hours tonight  just to relax.  I'm really tired, I need a break.  And you can watch something on TV as in a little escape to reality, but then come back  to reality.  Learn to be present in your relationships.  This is to me really, really big.  Learn your signs for when you're drifting into not being present to your kids or to your  partner.  Those will give you extra self-awareness of triggers of when you're starting to escape.  So for some of you, it's when you're on your phone and you really don't want to listen.  You're antsy when somebody wants to talk to you.  Your mind wanders a lot.  Those could be early warning signs.  And then realize when oxytocin is happening in your brain.  Because that is going to take you to your limbic brain, out of your cortex.  It is going to trigger your desire to go into a fantasy world.  And that can cause you to ignore red flags when you meet somebody.  I think in the work that I do, one of the biggest challenges is I see people get healthy.  They want to go back into the dating world after a period of time, after they've worked  on themselves.  And sometimes they'll ask me, do you think I'm ready?  I might say, yeah, I think so, but go really slow and check in all the time.  And so as they start into the dating world, it triggers oxytocin.  And so something in their cortex says, go slow and their limbic is saying go fast.  And their limbic is feeling so good right now.  They want to pursue that intense positive emotion and ignore their cortex.  And I think one of the hardest things for people to do is to stay in their cortex when  their limbic is being fueled by oxytocin.  And they say, I am going to continue doing looking for the facts about this person, not following  my feelings for this person, very, very difficult.  Now let me flip that.  Let's say that your friend is starting to date with somebody, oxytocin is in their brain  and you can see that they have gone to their limbic and shut their cortex down, put on  rose color glasses, ignored red flags, what do you do?  Two things that I tell clients, number one, don't say anything to them unless they have  a lot of respect for you, unless your words carry quite a bit of weight.  Because if they don't really respect you a ton, your words are pretty much empty to them.  Secondly, if you do say something, don't start nagging about it, don't get in their face  every time you see them, say your piece, but then bite your tongue.  Finally, don't allow the fantasies of others to infringe on your own safety, freedom, or  dignity.  Two examples.  Many women that I work with have had guys who have fantasized about them and fallen in  love with them and think that they love them.  And now that person is like a stalker, they're texting all the time, they're showing up at  their work, they're asking for dates constantly because they're pursuing their fantasy and  they don't accept the reality of the woman's no, I'm not interested.  You need to stand up to protect yourself in those cases because that person's fantasy  has become an obsession that could put you in danger.  Secondly, I work with people who have gone through psychosis, who still maybe have some  type of psychosis or schizoaffective, they can become dangerous.  And so you need to be aware of that.  And for some, and I've dealt with a number of them, part of what happened in their psychosis  was they went to a fantasy world, sometimes a sexual one.  And they wanted to make it reality in time.  And that would have put many people in danger.  Let me end with this.  Johann Martinson says this, success is not a big step in the future, success is a small  step taken right now.  Well, that's the end of part one.  If you do have escaping to fantasy as one of your coping tools, I hope this has helped  you understand yourself better.  I hope it's helped you see the dangers of it.  Again, it's given you some tools to begin to change that.  I'm going to take a one minute break and then we're going to come back and do the Christian  part.  And again, if you're not interested in the Christian part, no problem, no offense taken  by me, look forward to seeing you again next week.  For the rest of you, be back in a minute.  Well, welcome back to the Christian part.  We've been looking at the life of Peter, one of Jesus 12 disciples, a man who became  a very important leader in the early church after Jesus went back to heaven.  And we've been just going through the different events that are recorded from his life and  learning lessons from them and finding, I hope, that they're very helpful to people  in recovery, people dealing with complex trauma.  So today, we come to a section and you need to understand it in light of the last two  weeks, what we've been talking about.  Remember that Jesus had taken his disciples way up to the north of Israel to Cesarea  Philippi?  And he asked them, who do you, who do people say I am and who do you say I am?  And Peter said, you are the Messiah.  You are God's anointed one, the king of Israel.  And they thought that that would mean that Jesus would go into Jerusalem, overthrow all  the corrupt authorities, overthrow Rome, set up his kingdom with Jerusalem as the capital  city, and he would sit on the throne and the disciples would be all working for him  in his political government.  But Jesus then said, we're now going to leave Cesarea Philippi and head to Jerusalem where  I'm going to die.  And Peter was shocked by that and going, no, no, no, no, no, that can't happen Lord.  That didn't fit with what he thought about the Messiah.  Now, what's interesting to me is about a week passes now and we're not told anything about  what happened in that week.  And I just have a hunch or I wonder if there was a lot of tension because the disciples  are wrestling with this statement that Jesus is going to die, they're not liking it.  They're feeling very confused, they're wondering if they've been following the wrong guy,  their whole world and what they were dreaming about has all been just rocked.  And so you can imagine the tension, they don't know what to talk about.  They don't know what to say.  And so I think Jesus knows that the disciples badly need encouragement.  They need assurance that he is the Messiah, that they haven't got it wrong.  But more than that, Jesus knows that when he goes to Jerusalem and dies, that the disciples  are going to fail greatly, they're going to run away from him.  They're not going to be loyal.  And Peter is going to fail the most next to Judas Iscariot by denying with an oath that  he knows Jesus or has any connection to him.  And so Jesus knows that Peter, especially, but all the disciples are going to fail greatly,  to be probably considered from their perspective the greatest failure of their life to that  point.  And so he needs to prepare them for failure so that they can get back up again, so they  can forgive themselves.  So we come to Matthew 17.  So six days later, Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, that's James and John, the  inner three, he led them up a high mountain to be alone.  As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the  sun.  So his clothes became as white as light.  So you can just, this radiant, blinding light comes out of Jesus' body.  So that's what we call the transfiguration.  He's transfigured into this radiant being.  Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.  Peter exclaimed, Lord, it's wonderful for us to be here.  He's all excited.  He said, if you want, I'll make three shelters or memorials, one for you, one for Moses and  one for Elijah.  Let's set up a celebration here.  And even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them.  And a voice from the cloud said, this is my dearly loved son, who brings me great joy,  listen to him.  The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground.  I just want to share a few lessons.  So the first one that Jesus is giving the disciples this, I am going to go and die,  but here's what I'm going to be like after I die.  This is, death is not final.  I am going to be this radiant, beautiful being after I die.  And so what Jesus is helping the disciples to understand is that his death does not end  in defeat.  It will end in glory.  His death is not the end of the story.  He's making aware of a bigger story taking place, a story in which he dies, but it leads  to him being this radiant being.  Imagine how helpful that would have been to the disciples.  They were so concerned that the crucifixion of Jesus was going to be the end.  But now they see, no, he's still going to be the radiant king, the Messiah.  Whoa, what a load just fell off their shoulders.  But he doesn't end there.  Moses was there and Elijah were there in radiance as well.  And what Jesus is saying is, humans will one day share in my glory.  Just as Moses and Elijah shared in my glory, you guys will one day share in my glory.  You're not going to live in this frustrating place forever.  You're not going to live in this world that is marked by pain and sickness and death and  famine and disease forever.  One day you're going to share with me in my glory.  So your dream isn't going to happen like you thought it was, but it's still going to happen  in an even greater way than you probably ever dreamed.  But then look at the two witnesses, Moses and Elijah.  Both were great leaders amongst God's people.  Moses considered to be one of the greatest leaders.  Elijah, a great prophetic leader.  What is interesting is that Moses was not allowed to go into the land god promised Israel  because he failed.  I guess where Moses is now in the land god promised Israel.  And what God is showing is that even though Moses failed and couldn't physically at that time  go into the land, God has forgiven him and rewarded him with the land.  And then Elijah, this great prophet that brought Israel back to God, his life ended on  a low.  He was depressed.  He wanted to die and whereas he, with Jesus in his glory, so what is Jesus saying?  Even great men fail, Peter.  Great men even fail greatly, but that doesn't mean that's the end for them.  People might think so, but God isn't done.  He forgives and he will bring them to a place they didn't  earn or deserve a place that God's grace is provided of sharing in Jesus' glory and  Peter.  You're going to fail one day greatly in the very near future, but I will forgive you.  What a help that would be after Peter's failure for him to go back into his, in his mind  to that mount where Jesus was transfigured and remember Moses and Elijah.  But just think of this meant for Jesus.  I think it would have been just so encouraging for Jesus to talk to Moses and Elijah.  They understood leadership.  They understood the struggles of leadership, the frustrations of leadership.  They understood deep pain, rejection.  They understood what Jesus was going to be going through.  And that would be so encouraging.  But they also reminded Jesus, but this event also reminded Jesus that his death was not  final, that it was the doorway, the entry point to great glory.  And he had to keep that in mind.  And then he heard his father speak from heaven and say, this is my son.  I am pleased with him.  I am proud with him.  That tells us that Jesus is starting to think a lot about dying.  About all the pain, the rejection, the torture he's going to go through, what it's going  to be like for him, a pain beyond what we can even imagine.  And God is already encouraging him and letting him know you are in my will, you are on track.  I am so pleased with you and proud of you and he validates his son.  So this Transfiguration, beautiful lessons, I hope they help you, I hope they just kind  of encourage you and also help you see that God is aware of what we are going through  or what we are going to be going through in the future.  And he's very involved in our lives to help us through those times.  Let's pray.  Father, I'm just grateful for this story and just the situation time wise, how critical  it was for Peter, because of all that he was going through and would go through in the  next weeks and how you just prepared him and helped him to get through a time of great  failure.  And I just pray you to encourage and help each person here tonight, amen.  Well that's the end of our Friday, thank you so much again for sharing it with us.  We look forward to seeing you again next Friday, have a great weekend.
