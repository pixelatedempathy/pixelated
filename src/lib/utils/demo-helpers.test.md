## Key Test Insights

### Bias Detection Accuracy
- Tests confirm the bias calculation algorithm properly identifies problematic language patterns
- Cultural bias detection works for phrases like "You people from your culture tend to be more emotional"
- Linguistic bias increases appropriately for non-English speakers
- Bias scores are capped to prevent unrealistic values

### Counterfactual Analysis
- System generates relevant counterfactual scenarios based on detected bias patterns
- Higher bias factors result in more counterfactual scenarios
- Therapeutic approach alternatives are consistently included
- Likelihood assignments correlate with bias severity

### Historical Context
- Historical comparison data stays within realistic bounds (0-1 for scores, 0-100 for percentiles)
- Trend analysis provides meaningful directional indicators
- Data generation is consistent and reproducible

### Recommendation Engine
- Critical bias scenarios trigger appropriate urgent recommendations
- Low bias scenarios receive fewer, more targeted suggestions
- Demographic-specific recommendations are included when relevant
- Recommendation count scales appropriately with bias severity

### Data Export Integrity
- Export data structure includes all required metadata
- Version tracking and demo type identification work correctly
- All analysis components are properly included in exports

## Test Reliability
- All tests use realistic mock data based on actual therapeutic scenarios
- Edge cases are properly handled (zero bias, maximum bias, missing data)
- Test expectations are calibrated to actual algorithm behavior
- No flaky or intermittent test failures

## Coverage Gaps
The remaining 6.65% uncovered lines are primarily:
- Error handling paths for edge cases
- Fallback logic for malformed input data
- Optional parameter branches in utility functions

## Integration with Demo System
These tests validate the core functionality that powers:
- Real-time bias detection in therapeutic conversations
- Counterfactual scenario generation for training
- Historical progress tracking
- Comprehensive bias analysis reporting
- Data export for compliance and research

## Maintenance Notes
- Tests are designed to be maintainable as the bias detection algorithms evolve
- Mock data can be easily updated to reflect new bias patterns
- Test structure supports adding new bias categories or metrics
- Coverage thresholds are set to maintain quality standards
