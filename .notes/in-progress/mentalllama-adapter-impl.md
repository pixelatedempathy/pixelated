# ðŸ§  MentalLLaMA Adapter Foundational Implementation

This document details the tasks completed as part of the initial, foundational implementation of the `MentalLLaMAAdapter`, `MentalHealthTaskRouter`, and related crisis notification logic. This was necessary because the adapter was previously a stub.

## âœ… Completed Tasks (as of 2025-06-26)

### Core Types Definition (`src/lib/ai/mental-llama/types/mentalLLaMATypes.ts`)
- [x] Defined `MentalHealthAnalysisResult` (including `isCrisis`, `_routingDecision`)
- [x] Defined `CrisisContext` for `ICrisisNotificationHandler`
- [x] Defined `RoutingInput` and `RoutingContext`
- [x] Defined `RoutingDecision`
- [x] Defined `LLMInvoker` function type
- [x] Defined `MentalLLaMAAdapterOptions`
- [x] Defined or ensured alignment with `ICrisisNotificationHandler`

### `MentalHealthTaskRouter` Implementation (`src/lib/ai/mental-llama/routing/MentalHealthTaskRouter.ts`)
- [x] Created `MentalHealthTaskRouter` class.
- [x] Constructor accepts a (stubbed) `LLMInvoker`.
- [x] Implemented `determineRoute(input: RoutingInput): Promise<RoutingDecision>`:
    - [x] Orchestrates keyword matching, LLM classification (stubbed), and contextual rules.
    - [x] Prioritizes crisis detection.
- [x] Implemented `matchKeywords(text: string)`:
    - [x] Defined `KEYWORD_ROUTING_RULES` for crisis, depression, anxiety, etc.
- [x] Implemented `performBroadClassificationLLM(text: string, context?: RoutingContext)`:
    - [x] **Updated: Now makes actual LLM calls via `OpenAIModelProvider` (if configured).**
- [x] Implemented `applyContextualRules(currentDecision: RoutingDecision, context: RoutingContext)` (basic initial rules).
- [x] Defined `LLM_CATEGORY_TO_ANALYZER_MAP`.

### `MentalLLaMAAdapter` Implementation (`src/lib/ai/mental-llama/MentalLLaMAAdapter.ts`)
- [x] Created `MentalLLaMAAdapter` class.
- [x] Constructor accepts `MentalLLaMAAdapterOptions` (modelProvider, pythonBridge?, crisisNotifier?, taskRouter?).
- [x] Implemented `analyzeMentalHealth(text: string, routingContextParams?: Partial<RoutingContext>): Promise<MentalHealthAnalysisResult>`:
    - [x] Invokes `taskRouter.determineRoute()`.
    - [x] Based on `RoutingDecision.isCritical` or `targetAnalyzer === 'crisis'`:
        - [x] If `crisisNotifier` exists, calls `crisisNotifier.sendCrisisAlert()`.
        - [x] Sets `isCrisis` flag in the result.
        - [x] Constructs and returns `MentalHealthAnalysisResult` indicating crisis.
    - [x] If not a crisis:
        - [x] **Uses `ModelProvider` for detailed analysis of `general_mental_health` category.**
        - _Detailed analysis for other non-crisis categories (depression, anxiety, etc.) using a `ModelProvider` is NOT YET IMPLEMENTED._
- [x] Implemented `analyzeMentalHealthWithExpertGuidance` as a basic stub.
- [x] Implemented `evaluateExplanationQuality` as a basic stub.

### `IModelProvider` and `OpenAIModelProvider` Implementation
- [x] Defined `IModelProvider` interface in `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/providers/types.ts`.
- [x] Implemented `OpenAIModelProvider` in `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/providers/OpenAIModelProvider.ts`.
- [x] Added `OPENAI_API_KEY` configuration to `env.config.ts` and `.env.example` (verified existing).

### `MentalLLaMAFactory` Update (`src/lib/ai/mental-llama/index.ts`)
- [x] Removed the original adapter stub.
- [x] Imports the new `MentalLLaMAAdapter`, `MentalHealthTaskRouter`, `SlackNotificationService`, and `OpenAIModelProvider`.
- [x] In `createFromEnv()`:
    - [x] Initializes `SlackNotificationService` if `config.notifications.slackWebhookUrl()` is available.
    - [x] **Initializes `OpenAIModelProvider` if `OPENAI_API_KEY` is available.**
    - [x] **Creates an `llmInvokerForRouter` that uses the initialized `ModelProvider` (or falls back to stub if no provider).**
    - [x] Instantiates `MentalHealthTaskRouter` with this invoker.
    - [x] Instantiates `MentalLLaMAAdapter` with the router, conditional notifier, and the actual (or undefined) `modelProvider`.
    - [x] Returns the instantiated adapter and other components.

### Slack Webhook Configuration
- [x] Modified `src/config/env.config.ts`:
    - [x] Added `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL` to `envSchema`.
    - [x] Added `slackWebhookUrl()` accessor to `config.notifications`.
- [x] Added `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL=""` to `.env.example`.

### User/Session Flagging Documentation (Crisis Protocol)
- [x] In `MentalLLaMAAdapter.ts`, added a detailed `// TODO:` comment for future integration with a user/session management API for flagging crisis sessions.

### Deferred Item Documentation
- [x] Added detailed `TODO` comments in `MentalLLaMAAdapter.ts` regarding future work on scaling, performance optimizations, and testing.
- [x] Created `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/docs/README.md` to document stubbed features (TaskRouter LLM calls, ModelProvider integration) and list deferred/future work items (performance, scalability, reliability).

### Basic Testing & Verification (CLI Script)
- [x] Modified `src/scripts/mental-llama-analyze.ts`:
    - [x] Added `--crisis-text` flag.
    - [x] Ensured `routingContextParams` are passed.
    - [x] Logs the full `MentalHealthAnalysisResult`.
    - _Manual verification of Slack notification dispatch is still required with a live webhook URL._

## Outstanding Items from Original Checklist (Now Deferred or Requiring Full Implementation)

Many items from the original `.notes/in-progress/mentalllama-integration.md` checklist implicitly relied on a fully functional `MentalLLaMAAdapter`. The following areas now require more substantial implementation rather than just minor modifications:

- **Full LLM Integration in TaskRouter**: The `performBroadClassification` method needs to make actual LLM calls.
- **Model-Based Analysis in Adapter**: The `analyzeMentalHealth` method in the adapter needs to use a `ModelProvider` to perform detailed analysis for various mental health categories beyond basic routing and crisis flagging.
- **PythonBridge Integration**: If required for specific models or evaluations.
- **Performance Optimizations**: Caching, batching, async processing (most are deferred).
- **Advanced Evaluation**: `evaluateExplanationQuality` needs a real implementation.
- **Scalability and Reliability Features**: Require dedicated implementation efforts.
