## Known Issues & Blockers

### Critical Items
1. **Bias Detection Model**: No trained model currently available
   - **Impact**: Core functionality blocked
   - **Next Steps**: Research available pre-trained models or establish training pipeline

### Minor Items
- Test coverage currently estimated at 20-30% (needs formal measurement)
- Integration testing framework needs setup
- Documentation needs to be synchronized with code changes

## Recent Accomplishments
- ✅ **Memory Bank System Complete**: All core files created and configured
- ✅ **Project Structure Analysis**: Full codebase understanding established
- ✅ **Development Environment**: Basic setup validated and working
- ✅ **Documentation Framework**: Comprehensive project documentation created

## Next Immediate Goals

### This Week
1. **Establish CI/CD Pipeline**: Set up basic GitHub Actions workflow
2. **Create Hello World API**: Simple endpoint to validate infrastructure
3. **Database Schema Design**: Complete initial database structure
4. **Fix Memory Bank Integration**: Optimize file-based memory bank system

### This Month
1. **Bias Detection MVP**: Working end-to-end bias detection service
2. **Basic Frontend**: Functional user interface for testing
3. **80% Test Coverage**: Comprehensive testing suite
4. **Production Environment**: Bootstrapped staging deployment

## Custom Commands & Workflows

### Frequently Used Commands
```bash
# Development workflow
pnpm install                  # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev                  # Start development server
pnpm run build               # Production build
pnpm run test                # Run test suite
pnpm run lint                # Lint and fix code

# Docker workflow
docker-compose up -d         # Start all services
docker-compose down          # Stop all services
docker build -t pixelated .  # Build container

# Memory Bank management (custom)
# Note: These would typically be custom commands but can be executed manually:
# - Update memory bank files after significant changes
# - Review all memory bank documentation before project decisions
```

### Custom Memory Bank Commands
The Memory Bank system is now fully operational with working file-based commands:

1. **Update Memory Bank**: Ask Cline to "**update memory bank**" after significant changes
2. **Read Context**: Reference `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for custom commands and context
3. **Add Custom Commands**: Edit `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to add your own workflows
4. **Review Changes**: Use `git diff memory-bank/` to see documentation updates
5. **Search Documentation**: `grep "custom" memory-bank/activeContext.md` to find command examples
6. **Validate Setup**: All 6 core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are now established and ready for customization

## Performance & Metrics Goals

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- **API Response Time**: <100ms P95
- **Uptime**: 99.9%
- **Accuracy**: >95% for bias detection
- **Throughput**: 1000 requests/second

### Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Prometheus metrics collection
- [ ] Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Alert manager configuration
- [ ] Log aggregation with ELK stack

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Model Quality**: Without trained models, core value proposition is blocked
- **Performance**: AI inference performance may not meet real-time requirements
- **Scalability**: Initial architecture may need significant refactoring

### Medium Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple technologies may introduce complexity
- **Security**: Need thorough security review before production deployment
- **User Adoption**: May require UX/UI work to drive user engagement

### Low Risk
- **Technology Choices**: Well-established technologies with strong community support
- **Team Dependencies**: No external team dependencies identified

## Future Considerations
- Multi-cloud deployment strategy
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Machine learning model marketplace
- API ecosystem and partnerships
- Mobile application development
