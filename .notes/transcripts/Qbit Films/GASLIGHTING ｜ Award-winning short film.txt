I love you. I love you. I love you. Morning, honey. Morning. You woke me up. Again. How? You were sleeping when I got up. As usual, you wake up first and then you try to wake me up. What? You always do that. But I wasn't trying to wake you up. I just wanted to see if you were awake, maybe. And that you woke me up. Of course. I hardly touched you. Gosh, I was half asleep by myself. I let you alone, didn't I? Why are you so bitchy this morning? Have you slept poorly? No. I slept perfectly till you had to wake me up. Can you please stop now? Or do I want to ruin the whole day? Here are your eggs. Thank you, honey. You know, I'm sorry. Maybe I did sleep badly. I can't really remember. Thank you for the eggs. It's okay, darling. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have touched you when you were asleep. I know you don't like that. It's okay. It's not so important. Let's eat now. You can't expect me to always clean up after you. We're not in the 50s. I have a job. Why can't we have a proper conversation about that? Why do you switch now? Fighting again? Really? Everything was just so fine. You're always doing the same thing. You're always ruining everything. I don't want to talk to you. I'm sorry I'm calling so late. It's just... I said... He said... Love at first sight makes you happy. It's a big Ch product. You get aÃ§Ãº iruli for any of yourss. The killer's eyes. InHey,d? You talk about your doll, inherent pig of your stomach. Anything that's uncomfortable. At this particular moment, there's still a knife thatword of Vipshop finally scored my touching. So... Oh, attitude is so important. You're looking great inside. I am a little scared and distressed at yourys. If you say shit like... buradan supervision only... ...all the bad on the surface. You want to go back and start getting patted matches? You're not listening to Yusakun. It's not like you have any contact with him. You've said it so often. It's clearly not what I consider necessary. Sorry. Who was it? No one. It doesn't matter. So next week? Yeah. Yeah? Great. What do you have to say? Uh-oh. Wait. Let's find out. Good night, honey. Good night, honey. Good night, honey. Come on, come on, I don't want him to wait. It's just five minutes. I waited for you to leave the apartment, remember? Now you command me to run? I just can't get anywhere because of the stupid five minutes. I just can't get anywhere because of the stupid five minutes. Did Peter call you? Do we have to hurry up? No, but I don't want to be disrespectful towards him. Go faster. It's five minutes, just ride him. I will not ride him. Come on. No. We will be late. Do as I say. Are you crazy? I'm not your dog. I don't want to make him wait. Why? It's so awful to let him wait five minutes. What the fuck, Alex? Just hurry up. I don't want to make him wait. If you say this one more time. He seriously thinks I have to run after him? I'm not having this. Goodness. Not now. Hi, Vicky. Look, there are ways in which you can talk to me and others in which you can't. Look, there are ways in which you can talk to me and others in which you can't. It's non-negotiable. If you bitch at me like that, I won't follow you anywhere. If you bitch at me like that, I won't follow you anywhere. It's your decision how you talk to me but it's also my decision if I'm having that or not. You understand? Yeah, you're right. I know what you mean. I shouldn't talk to you like that. Look, I'm with Sonja now and I have to go to work soon, okay? See you later, darling. Okay. Bye. I really don't need stress like this before work. Such a drama. Why did you have to make such a... ðŸŽµ Last week you didn't close the door for me. Come on, I'm a show-in now. I told you days ago, of course you know how to close the fucking door. We've been living here for two weeks by now. I can't believe this. Oh my god, I even sent you a fucking video of me closing the door for Christ's sake. Leave me alone with this shit now. Maria Caroline, from that show, then. Are you insane? We're talking grown-up women here and that includes me. Would you ask a man, let's say Peter, to do the same thing? If you didn't close the door before, of course I would. You fucking bastard knew you wouldn't. Stop it now! You always know everything better. You've got a problem, Vicky. And it's also the reason why I don't have so many friends. Open the door, Vicky. What the fuck? Go have your dinner. That's hysterical, Vicky. Don't you think you're a bit neurotic? It wasn't for nothing. Calm down, please. Okay? You're really overreacting right now. I'm sorry. You have a talent for bringing me up the wall. So why do you do that? Do you enjoy having a tantrum. Sorry. Why do you do that? What? You know, we talked about that many times already. Your anger problem and all this. And I really don't want to talk about it anymore, but something will have to change. You know? Exactly. Also, talking about old things is not really healthy. You know that. We talked about that too. You seem really exhausted. Maybe you should rest for tonight. Hey, hey, how are you? I'm good. You know what? Today I went to the massage parlor, the new one down the street. It was so painful. Oh, I hate when they do that. Yeah, right? And the thing is, I didn't say anything. Can you believe that? I mean, I don't understand. Why didn't I tell her to not hurt me? It was really painful. You know? Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You know, sometimes we're so busy with getting hurt, like processing the pain really, or simply needing a moment to feel the relief in between that we can't stand up for ourselves, I think. You see, if the breaks between the painful experiences are too short, there's simply no energy left, I guess. You know what I mean? We hardly have enough time to gasp, let alone defend ourselves. Oh my god. You're so beautiful. You're so beautiful. You're so beautiful. You're so right. I mean, I didn't even tell her when I was paying. You know, like, the only time when they asked you if everything was alright. Well, you probably didn't feel like it because you didn't say anything before. And mentioning it now would seem rather stupid, wouldn't it? Yeah. Yeah. without you acting all weird. What is your problem? Why do you put it on me? Do you think you're a good person? Careful. You're such a crazy woman. Maybe I should part with you. Alright. Am Iially sleeping with you? Am Iially sleeping with you? Am Iially sleeping with you? Thanks to the viewers that made it in to honoring. Let's do different things. There are many possibilities in life but you're there. Thank you.
