So emotional symptoms.  When you have been betrayed, what are common emotional symptoms that you are going to experience?  Well, you are going to go through a time of shock, denial, disbelief.  So just think of finding out that your partner cheated on you, that your partner's been lying to you, that your partner's been texting somebody else and sharing their heart with somebody else, that your partner spent all your money.  You are in shock.  You just cannot believe it.  Then you can go to a deep grief.  You are just overwhelmed with a deep sadness, often even a hopelessness.  Life just is so negative, painful, dark.

But then you can go to that deep anger, rage, then you can go to just fear.  What now?  What's going to happen in my life?  And everything is scary.  And then you can get paranoid and almost have this kind of terror that you live with.  Some go to guilt.  I must have done something wrong.  It's probably my fault.  And that's that self-blame stuff that we just talked about.  Others go, it triggers their shame at a deep level.  See, that proves I am not worth anything.  I am not lovable.  I am not valuable.  If I was, they would not have done this.  And so it just reinforces the deep, deep shame messages.  Others just go numb.  It's too much to take in.  They just go to not feeling anything.  And they detach from others.  They just do not want to be with anybody.  They just want to be alone.  And they are just numb.  Then it can lead to just this haunting loneliness that the person I thought loved me has betrayed me.  I am all alone and it is overwhelming.  And then often a deep feeling of being violated.  Then another thing that begins often to happen emotionally with people is after they have been betrayed, they have a great deal of difficulty regulating their emotions.  So all of a sudden, they have massive mood swings.  They have massive mood swings.  They have massive mood swings.  They have huge mood swings several times a day, or they get triggered and they just go from zero to 100 in a nanosecond and they cannot stop it.  So emotional regulation becomes a problem.  Others then begin to struggle with depression, anxiety, worry, panic attacks.  Some go to this apathy, they lose all motivation for life.  The things that they used to enjoy, they do not do anything for them anymore.  They just blah.  Some go to suicidal ideation.  What's the point of living?  And then there's a term that's called alexothymia.  And this would come out of a child being betrayed in complex trauma.  And it's also called emotional blindness.  And so it's a neuro-psychological phenomenon characterized by significant challenges in recognizing, expressing, and describing one's own emotions.  So this is a person who, as a child is betrayed, it's too much to deal with.  So they just shut down and they do not feel anymore.  And then they disconnect from their emotional world and they do not even know how to recognize emotions anymore, they do not know what emotions are, they do not even feel emotions, that's alexothymia.  And that can happen out of betrayal trauma.  Then there's cognitive symptoms.  Of betrayal trauma.  And so again, if you have been cheated on, etc.  , what can happen in the days and months that follow is you can have flashbacks and nightmares.  You can relive it.  And you can be going through your day and all of a sudden have intrusive thoughts.  You just start thinking about it and you did not even want to think about it, but it just intrudes into your thought life.

Another thing is that you can begin to have memory issues.  So you forget stuff, short-term stuff.  Other people is deep confusion.  And it's almost at an existential level.  Like, what's the purpose of living?  Who am I?  Do I matter?  Who cares about life?  All of those questions, deep confusion about where you are going in life, what to do next.  It just becomes this very confusing time.  And then you can become very difficult to concentrate.  And so you get distracted easily.  You just cannot get focused.  That's a common symptom after a person's been betrayed.  Then dissociation.  It's almost like you feel detached from reality.  You are just zombie mode.  You go through the motions of life, but you are not there.  For some, there's even a sense of time slows down or even stops.  They are just not connected to the present.  Others then have trouble making decisions.  They do not trust their ability to make decisions anymore because they have just been betrayed by somebody they thought they could trust, somebody they decided to trust.  And so it really starts to mess up their confidence in making decisions for themselves.  And then for many, it unleashes kind of these persistent negative beliefs about life.  They get really cynical.  They get cynical about themselves, about the world, about people.  And so some of the persistent negative stuff can be shame messages.  They go right back to the inner critic.  It's your fault.  You are not good enough.  You do not matter.  They cannot see it that moment that it's made up of all lies because it feels like the truth.  Somebody just betrayed me.  And so shame messages get louder.  And with that is, I guess I am just a burden to everybody.  I guess I am nobody's ever going to want me.  I just do not matter.  People only show love to me when it's convenient.  I am not going to want to be loved.  It's convenient.  When they can get something from me.  And those messages spin around.  And then you can go to nobody's there for me.  Nobody can be trusted in the world.  I am all alone.  And that just gets darker and darker.

But those are the kind of thoughts that begin to fill the brain and create constant chatter in the brain.  Then there's some physical symptoms that can happen.  Can happen after you have been betrayed and these I think are really important to understand so again just think you just find out your husband's cheated on you you can go to physically shaking and then you can just be constantly agitated you cannot sit still you cannot calm yourself your legs jiggling all the time then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal that happens with people you can then start having panic attacks that come out of nowhere some go to either constipation or diarrhea it just throws off their whole gastrointestinal system some insomnia or they just want to sleep all the time some they get startled really easily the slightest little thing and they jump others find their blood pressure goes up or they have a racing heartbeat others all of a sudden you get you get a little bit of a panic attack and then you can just be sweating a lot way more than normal you get aches and pains you get muscle tension you get inflammation all of a sudden that happens or you get migraines headaches that you do not normally get or you are just tired all the time so you can sleep all the time or you cannot sleep at all but you are tired all the time so those are some of the physical symptoms that can happen right after you realize you have been betrayed that leads to behavioral symptoms that often happen with people that have been Freshly betrayed so I just want to isolate from people I cannot face anybody I do not want to have to explain I do not want to have to talk so I am going to isolate and then crying frequently just cannot stop crying decreasing self-care do not take care of yourself do not shower do not eat properly do not sleep properly all of that can happen do not do the things that you used to do as healthy self-care or escapes healthy hobbies you just cannot work as much and so there's a decrease in your work productivity there's an increase or decrease in your eating we have talked about that for some there's an increase in aggressiveness in reactivity the person says the slightest little thing to you and you go into attack mode and you lash out that can happen others just spend all their time on social media that just numbs them out they just scroll through page after page of social media others go into just buying stuff and so they make all kinds of unnecessary purchases it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of that pain for a while so others go to alcohol and drugs it's a way of numbing it's a way of getting out of the pain some go to reckless behavior they drive radically they all of a sudden do stuff that potentially is quite risky they could die but part of them does not care if I die I die and so they are increased there's an increase in risky behavior then there's relationships symptoms that come out of it and they are more long term for people so they have been betrayed now they are looking at starting a relationship again just a friendship it's not necessarily romantic could be but it's not necessarily but all of a sudden they find that they are struggling to open up they are struggling with any kind of deeper intimacy that just scares them they can even be suspicious of kindness so somebody's super kind to them and they go are they grooming me is there what do they want is there a hidden agenda here and so they have huge trust issues they do not know if they can ever trust again so they are suspicious of everything and then if they do get in a relationship they have difficulty maintaining that relationship every little thing the person does they overanalyze they look for negative they find the betrayal they pull away they test the other person and so they are they have difficulty maintain relationships and then if the other person is wanting to get closer and get to know them better they are not comfortable with that so they are kind of resisting that or pushing people away and then they can have Jealousy issues they start to get in a relationship and every time that belongs that person talks to somebody else they they are like I give them an insult anyway but the reason why more love is to get in that relationship and this has said a lot at least for some times the relationship and then another one of these relationships often are not focused that way they are like just five two three or five هنا it's hard to run and tell guys and their correspondents can around them just it's hard to keep your Benson rods and get out of prison the person that does the other person and they know that tied off fighting real estate and this is cum star smell all white and it stirs up stuff and they get super jealous and that can cause trouble and then they can have all have a odd oppositional defiance so they get in a relationship and the person says i think you should do this or here's what i think we should do and it's almost like something is triggered inside of them that i want to do the opposite i am not going to follow anybody's advice i am not going to trust anybody's advice i have to make all my decisions by myself then for some now when they get in a relationship to them if i am not going to be betrayed by you and i am going to be able to trust you then we there can be no boundaries you can never say no to me you can never say you need some personal space and so they resist boundaries and boundaries to them proves you are not loyal you do not love me you do not care care.  So what you can see is betrayal trauma sets a person up to have great difficulty in future relationships and that is what most people realize is their biggest challenge as they come out of betrayal trauma.  There's one other thing that happens with betrayal trauma that includes sexual abuse and that is there's sexual symptoms in the future and so there can be an aversion to sex.  Sex just makes me feel dirty.  Sex makes me feel awful.  It's disgusting and so it just triggers so much painful stuff.  I do not want sex or if I do have sex it's just I do it out of obligation.  It's not something I enjoy but I do it out of obligation.  Some become just uncomfortable with any physical touch, sexual touch.  Does not even have to be intercourse.  It's just touch me in any way that feels sexual and I just feel this revulsion inside.  Some are not able to ever achieve orgasm again.  Some during sex they just check out of their body.  They feel distant.  They dissociate.  Others they regularly have sexual flashbacks, dreams about the sexual abuse, intrusive thoughts about the sexual abuse.  Others have actually physical pain in their sexual organs.  That is an ongoing thing and then others have shame, sexual shame about what happened, body shame about what happened and so there's huge ongoing results or ramifications that come out of betrayal trauma related to sexual abuse.  There's one other area that is significant for some and that's where that betrayal trauma is experienced in your relationship with your higher power.  That you feel God has let you down.  God has betrayed you and so all of a sudden you are dealing with anger with God.  So these are spiritual symptoms.  You blame your higher power for your problems.  You blame your higher power for your problems.  You blame your higher power for your problems.  And so you lose interest in prayer, in meditation, in going to church, in meeting with other people in your spiritual support group.  You question everything.  You just feel totally abandoned by God.  You doubt that God even exists but yet you fear that God's upset with you and is going to judge you and that other people in your religion are judging you.  And so that's got massive ramifications as well.  So I hope you are really getting a feel for the fact that this betrayal trauma is huge and it has massive ramifications.  Tt's not just painful.  It just messes up a whole bunch of life for years and years and years.  And so what I hope you begin to realize is wow you can heal from this, but it is going to take some work to heal from this.  And it's going to take some special tools to heal from this.
