# TODOs / Placeholders — bias_detection_service.py

This file lists the placeholder implementations, empty blocks, and TODO-like items found in
`src/lib/ai/bias-detection/python-service/bias_detection_service.py` and gives a short suggested
fix and priority for each.

Format: [Priority] Location (approx. line or function) — Short description / suggestion

---

[P0] `_run_fairlearn_analysis` (Fairlearn analysis) — placeholder predictions
- Snippet: `y_pred = np.random.choice([0, 1], size=len(y))  # Placeholder predictions`
- Why: Random predictions produce meaningless fairness metrics.
- Suggested fix: Use real model predictions or a deterministic, pluggable test-stub; wire a model infer API.

[P0] `_run_interpretability_analysis` (SHAP/LIME) — placeholder return
- Snippet: comment "Placeholder for interpretability analysis" and return with `np.random.uniform`.
- Why: Needs real SHAP/LIME explanations or a stable mock for testing.
- Suggested fix: Integrate SHAP/LIME pipelines or provide a deterministic explainability adapter.

[P1] `_run_hf_evaluate_analysis` — placeholder HF evaluate
- Snippet: comment "Placeholder for HF evaluate analysis" returning random fairness/toxicity scores.
- Suggested fix: Integrate `evaluate` from Hugging Face with configured metrics or provide a stub
  adapter that can be swapped at runtime.

[P1] Analysis helpers with random placeholders
- Locations: `_analyze_interaction_patterns`, `_analyze_engagement_levels`, `_analyze_performance_disparities`, `_analyze_outcome_fairness`, etc.
- Snippet: comments `# Placeholder analysis` and returns with `np.random.*` values.
- Suggested fix: Replace with deterministic heuristics using session data or hook up proper analytic functions.

[P1] `_create_synthetic_dataset` — synthetic dataset assumptions
- Snippet: synthetic data generator with fixed distributions and minimum sample size (n_samples >= 100).
- Why: Useful for prototyping but should be documented and/or decoupled into a test utility.
- Suggested fix: Move synthetic generator to a test helper module and allow injection of real datasets.

[P2] Empty/placeholder import and init blocks
- Location: top-of-file feature detection (NLP, interpretability, visualization) — many `try:`/`except` blocks are empty or have missing handling.
- Suggested fix: Fill logging, fallback assignment, and feature flag handling; prefer explicit imports inside guarded blocks.

[P2] SecurityManager / AuditLogger / service initializers — many methods empty or thin
- Location: `SecurityManager`, `AuditLogger.__init__`, `BiasDetectionService._initialize_components` etc.
- Suggested fix: Implement or at least add minimal behavior (clear return values, logging) and unit tests; ensure encryption key creation, JWT verification, and audit writing are testable and documented.

[P2] many `except Exception:` blocks with no or minimal handling
- Location: pervasive across file
- Suggested fix: Add explicit logging, return structured errors, and avoid swallowing exceptions silently.

[P2] Dashboard / Export endpoints use hard-coded placeholder data
- Location: `/dashboard` endpoint and `/export` endpoint
- Snippets: `# Placeholder dashboard data` and `# Placeholder export data` (hard-coded payloads)
- Suggested fix: Implement real aggregation (DB or telemetry) or clearly mark these as development-only and gate behind an environment flag.

[Info] Celery task status handling — the selected line
- Location: `/task/<task_id>` endpoint, building `response`:
  - `"current": result.info or None` (selected line)
- Note: This expression is fine; it coalesces `result.info` to `None` when falsy. Not a TODO. Consider serializing `result.info` safely if it contains non-JSON types.
- Suggested fix (optional): Wrap `result.info` extraction with a safe serializer and/or type-check to avoid JSON errors (e.g., `current = getattr(result, 'info', None)` then `json_safe(current)`).

Suggested next steps (small, safe changes):
1. Replace the `y_pred` placeholder with a deterministic stub function (test-safe) and add a unit test for `_run_fairlearn_analysis` happy path.
2. Move all `np.random.*` placeholders into a single `placeholder_adapters.py` module and mark them clearly; this makes future replacement trivial.
3. Add minimal implementations for `SecurityManager._generate_encryption_key` and `AuditLogger.log_event` (if missing/empty), plus unit tests that run in CI.
4. Add a `TODO` label or issue tracker links in this markdown for large items (SHAP, HF evaluate integrations).

If you want I can:
- Create issues from each P0/P1 item and link them to this file.
- Implement step (1) now and add a unit test (fast). Tell me which you'd prefer.
