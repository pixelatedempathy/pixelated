### Notes

- The demo integrates with the actual psychology pipeline services built in tasks 5.1-5.8
- Components should be modular and reusable across different demo sections
- Real-time progress tracking requires WebSocket or polling integration
- Unit tests should cover all utility functions and React hooks
- End-to-end tests should verify the complete pipeline demonstration flow
- Use `pnpm dlx jest [optional/path/to/test/file]` to run tests
