# üìä Production Monitoring Framework

**Target**: Real-Time Production Oversight  
**Status**: Ready for Deployment  
**Updated**: January 2025  

---

## üéØ **MONITORING STRATEGY**

### **Three-Layer Approach**
1. **Infrastructure Layer**: System health, performance, availability
2. **Application Layer**: Feature functionality, user experience, AI quality
3. **Business Layer**: User satisfaction, clinical outcomes, safety metrics

### **Monitoring Philosophy**
- **Proactive**: Detect issues before users report them
- **Clinical-First**: Mental health safety takes priority
- **User-Centric**: Focus on actual user experience
- **Data-Driven**: Metrics guide all decisions
