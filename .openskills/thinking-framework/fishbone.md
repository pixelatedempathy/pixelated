# Fishbone Diagram (Ishikawa Diagram)

## Definition
Structure problem causes into categories: People, Process, Equipment, Environment (can add more like Materials, Measurements).

## Steps
1. Define the problem (head of fishbone)
2. Establish categories (main bones)
3. For each category, list potential causes (smaller bones)
4. Review and prioritize causes
5. Investigate most likely root causes

## Pros
- Systematic, structured analysis
- Visual representation aids team discussion
- Considers multiple dimensions simultaneously

## Cons
- Requires verification of cause-effect relationships
- Can become complex with many causes
- May miss interactions between categories

## Example
**Problem**: High customer complaint rate

- **People**: Lack of training, unclear responsibilities
- **Process**: No standard procedures, inconsistent quality checks
- **Equipment**: Outdated tools, frequent breakdowns
- **Environment**: Stressful work conditions, poor communication

**Analysis**: Identifies that "lack of training" + "no standard procedures" are primary contributors.

## When to Use
- Multi-dimensional problem analysis
- Team brainstorming sessions
- Quality management
- Complex system failures

## Success Context
- **root_cause_analysis**: 100% success rate
- Best for: Problems with multiple contributing factors
- Use with: Team collaboration for diverse perspectives
