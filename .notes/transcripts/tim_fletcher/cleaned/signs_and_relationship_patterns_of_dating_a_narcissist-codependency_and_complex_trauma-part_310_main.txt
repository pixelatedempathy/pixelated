So we are in a series on codependency and what we have been looking at is that codependency really is an overused term and I do not, it's got so much baggage anymore that one of the reasons I wanted to teach about it was to just clear up some of that baggage but also to show that I do not think you can understand codependency properly unless you understand complex trauma.  Because codependency to me is one of the symptoms that comes out of complex trauma.  And so last week we looked at that in the extreme case, complex trauma leads to deep shame which leads to extreme responses to that shame and the most severe response as far as overcompensating is a narcissist who thinks they are better than everybody.

But in order for a narcissist to be in a relationship, we showed that there has to be a co-narcissist and they tend to be at the other end of the shame as far as how they respond.  Same amount of shame, just totally different response, hate themselves, very low self-esteem.  They find each other and they create a relationship and that's what we talked about last week.  Tonight I want to go into the patterns that happen in codependent relationships.  I am going to talk a bit more about the extreme with the narcissist, the co-narcissist.

But the point that I want you to understand about codependency was it's two people with shame issues trying to solve their shame problems.  And what they do is they try to be there and fix the other person so that that other person will then love them and meet their needs and help fix their shame.  So both people are trying to fix their shame.  And so what I want you to do is I want you to fix the other person in order to try to get their own needs met and to solve their own shame problems and to get the love and respect they have always wanted.  So we in the first talk said that codependent relationships are what are called the dance of wounded souls.  So it's two wounded people dancing, trying to figure out how to get their needs met, how to manipulate the other person.  And so in order for that to work, you need a helper and you need somebody who's needy.  Or you need a narcissist or a co-narcissist.  So I do not know how many of you did the narcissist, co-narcissist test last week.  Nobody came rushing to me tonight to tell me the results of their test.

But I am not going to kind of beat that horse dead any longer.

Let me go to the helper or the narcissist role.  They tend to be attracted to, four different types of people that all have something in common.  So the first is they are attracted to wanting a relationship with somebody who's really impressive.  So the president of a company, the millionaire, whatever.  So now that they are connected to and they can kind of draw from that person's greatness and it reflects on themselves.  The second one is somebody that is just full of praise and admiration.  And the second one is somebody that is just full of love and admiration.  And you have to be a little bit more than that.  And if you have that love, you have to be a little bit more than that.  If you have that love, you have to be a little bit more than that.  I do not know how many people in my group have had a relationship with someone who's like, oh, we are just like, I am not going to do this.  I am going to do this.  I am not going to do this.  I am going to do this.  And admiration, and compliments, and they are constantly feeding the narcissist the stuff that they need to make them feel good.  And then the trophy, somebody they can put on their arm that makes them look really good because they are beautiful, because they are just such a wonderful person.  They are looking for that person.  And then the fourth is somebody who will put up with their crap and not leave them.  And they will, once their true colors come out, not get rid of them, but hang in there with them.  So narcissist, the helper person, looks for people like that.  The co-narcissist or the needy person, they are attracted to somebody who's full of charm and confidence, and they come across as appearing very strong and very full of self-worth and bold, all of those things that make this personality look like, wow, this guy's got it together.  And they are attracted to that.  And so those two people find themselves.

Now, what I want to now go into is the pattern that begins to happen.  And this is not in your notes.  I just want to show it to you.  So there's really three parts to the pattern.  And so what many of you are going to see is that there's a pattern that begins to happen.  And so what many of you are going to see is your relationships.  And it might be different face, same pattern, different face, same pattern.  And so basically three parts, the idealizing stage, then the devaluing stage, and then the discard stage.  And that's what I want to walk you through and help you understand how codependent relationships normally work themselves out.  So it begins with the idealizing stage.  And then the devaluing stage, and then the discard stage.  And ultimately it begins with stage one, or the idealizing stage, or the grooming stage.  This is the stage that is full of excitement, intensity.  It is just sizzling.  It is so hot.  And so what you got to remember is that we are grooming.  Now grooming's a technical word.  That means it's used in abuse.  And what it means is how does a person get past the other person's natural defenses and guards to get that person to like them and then trust them and so another way to look at this is grooming is really kind of the ultimate sales person so they are going to sell ice to an Eskimo and to do that they got to be really good at convincing this guy they are wonderful and getting this person to believe them and trust them and buy their product that's the grooming stage so number one is mirroring and again it's a technical term and it goes like this I do not know if you have ever been on a date and you say I really like country music and the other person says really I do too wow I love and you go you know what I am thinking of becoming vegan and they were really so am I and before you know it they like exactly what you like they are mirroring back they are listening to what you like and then mirroring back to you as if they like it so that you say we have so much in common I think we could have a great relationship meanwhile they go home and have a steak and they listen to hardcore rock music but not when they are with you they are mirroring you so the early days in the relationship is they are asking questions to find out what you like and they are taking notes so that they can present a package to you that you go we have so much in common okay next one love bombing so in understanding love languages we have you can show love to a person by saying loving things to them by giving them gifts by making acts of sacrifice for them and they are going to be able to do that and so that's for them by doing stuff that is a sacrifice by giving them Focus quality time and giving them lots of physical affection so what happens in love bombing is the person he says all the nicest things in the world he gives you gifts he makes all kinds of sacrifices you know what let me pay for that let me come over in the middle of night and help you and and all of that and then when you talk they give you focus like they you are the most interesting person in the world and they are going to be able to be the person in the world and they give you lots of physical affection they just bomb you with love and so what they are counting on is that you will connect with one of those five and when you connect you are going to go I feel so loved and you are going to this is wonderful and your oxytocin is going to start spurting in your brain and you are going to just feel great next one offering lots of emotional support so they listen but they do not just listen they listen with I am there for you I want to be supportive of you you feel free to text me and you feel free to call me if you are struggling I will come rushing over and they listen and they support you and say all kinds of encouraging things then they are very charming they are funny they are cute they are always positive they are very sweet considerate thoughtful all of those things and I cannot take my eyes off of them so these are things things that's what they do and they have got that down to an art okay now let me just stop and say this if you got your notes there just put a little bracket beside them and say red flags if I see a guy that's this charming and is love bombing me this way red flag okay well they really get to the red flags next okay so the next two become kind of the main red flags so number one they rush intimacy so they want you to open up about everything they want you to tell them lots and lots of stuff they want to know every detail about your day they are pushing you and pushing you for information I tell clients all the time and teaching them the natural development of healthy relationships from an acquaintance to a very close soulmate type friend you are looking at six year six months to a year what you have in a codependent relationship is one day to six days then what they are doing is they are pushing you for sex and then once they get that then they are pushing you to move in together but so they are pushing for an established type relationship they do not like stuff to remain in this unknown where they are not sure if you have bought their line yet so they are looking to conquer you and get you to say move in I think you are Mr perfect they rush that they pressure that so that leads to the next one and that is a hyper-sexuality and what I mean by this is they put sex before all other types of intimacy because sex they know creates feelings of intimacy and so they know that if they can get you to have sex that you are going to start to feel close to them and so then sex becomes basically the glue that brings the relationship together and then if you have a conflict They do not try to resolve the conflict.  They just want sex.  And sex is basically saying we have resolved the conflict.  See, we love each other again.  We do not need to talk about that crap because we just had sex.  So sex is getting pressured now, not just to bring you together, but to solve the problems in the relationship.  And it becomes the glue that holds it together.  Sex becomes more and more of a necessity to try to make this relationship work.  That is putting way too much pressure on sex.

But that is what begins to happen.  Now let me present it to you this way.  Women will often offer sex in order to get what they feel is love.  So they go, I will give you sex, just love me.  And guys will often give what looks like love in order to get what they feel is love.  And they will say, I will give you sex.  And so that can work in a way that you think sex is solving the problems in your relationship and creating a very good, healthy relationship.  So big red flags when it comes to the whole sex thing.

Let me just add one thing.  Well, I have talked to many women and it goes like this.  I say, let's say you start dating with a guy and a guy is not a narcissist.  A guy is not codependent.  And he's going to respect you and get to know you properly and slowly and carefully.  And he's not going to push you for sex.  After two weeks without him pushing for sex, after a month without him pushing for sex, what are you going to start to think?  And they go, I am going to think maybe I am ugly.  Maybe he does not like me.  Because you have been trained that sex should come right away to fix your shame.  To give you sex.  To give you an answer that you have value.  And so that becomes an issue that you have to work through.  So that's phase one.  So that's a bit of a fantasy or an idealized state within the relationship.  Now what begins to happen is this guy or this girl are looking to you to solve all their problems.  To make them happy and you are not doing it.  So they are becoming increasingly discontent with you.  Increasingly dissatisfied with the relationship.  And so that's part one.  Part two is if you are with a narcissist, they can only have a relationship if they are superior to you.  And so they have to, what they have done in the idealized stage is treat you as if you are better than them.  They have got to get that back in balance in their mind.  So they have got to put you back into the inferior position and reestablish that.  So what begins to happen in a relationship after you get through that fantasy stage and there's a discontent that begins to develop is a devaluing stage.  Where disrespect now begins to enter the relationship.  Little shots.  Little lashing out.  And so there's increased bouts of anger that begin to happen.  Verbal abuse, emotional abuse.  And that can build into physical abuse, financial abuse, sexual abuse.  So the devaluing stage is they are now blaming you for why they are discontent.  And they are lashing out at you.  Now they might not do this initially to your face.

But they might.  They might do it to their friends and say, you should see the biatch I got at home and all of this stuff.  And they call you all kinds of nasty things behind your back.

But that will begin to come into the relationship.  And there will be pot shots and all kinds of different things like that.  That will begin to take place.  So then what you find yourself doing is walking on eggshells.  Because you know they are irritable now.  You know that little thing.  You know that little thing set them off.  And they lash out.  So you are now on eggshells.

But what can also happen is both are becoming increasingly discontent with the other.  And for the narcissist, their narcissism is not getting fed now.  Because you are not responding.  So they can cheat.  They go looking for somebody else to feed their narcissism.  And then that means they have to start lying to you.  And then as it progresses.  So this is a progression.  I want you to get that.  This does not happen all at once.  This is a gradual thing.

But they begin to tell you less and less.  And they begin to become a parasite.  So they just basically look to mooch off of you.  You are there as their meal ticket to pay their bills, to feed them, to take care of them.  And they start to drain you financially.  And emotionally, they are a leech.  And that begins to happen.  Then they are still not happy.  You are not happy.  There's more conflict.  More anger.  More fear.  Walking on eggshells.  That they start what we call gaslighting.  And I am going to do a whole night on that.

But it basically is they get you to begin to doubt your perception of reality.  They begin to get you to doubt yourself, your thoughts.  Your emotions.  How you see things.  So that you begin to think maybe you are crazy.  And you have got it all wrong.  And what they are doing is wearing your self-image down.  So it's lower and lower.  So they are bringing you to a zero.  So you do not even believe what you see or think or feel.  In your world, the only person that you think is seeing it correctly is the narcissist.  And so they now have total power over you.  You now have zero power.  Zero self-image.  And that is a very dangerous, scary place.

But that can happen all the time.  What can happen at this stage, before it gets to the more severe stages, is the anger happens.  You are walking on eggshells.  Then you make up and go back to the ideal stage.  The honeymoon again.  That wears down.  And then you have another conflict because nobody's dealing with anything.  You have a blow-up.  And then you go back to the honeymoon stage again.  So you start a cycle of unresolved stuff.  Where you have honeymoon, which gets shorter and shorter and shorter.  And then blow-up, which gets more intense.  More intense.  And then after a while, it just all goes down the drain.  So that's the devalue stage.  And that can go on for months and months.  The third stage is what we call the discard stage or the replace stage.  And that basically means they discard you and replace you with somebody else.  So they are at this discontent.  You are no longer feeding their narcissism.  You are no longer being the mirror that they need.  So they go and find a new person.  And they start to groom them.  And as they groom them and love-bomb them and mirror them, that person just explodes with gratitude and feeds the narcissist all over again.  So that is what can begin to happen.

And so, a couple of things when they are getting rid of you.  Okay?  So first of all, you have got to remember that a narcissist is all about their image.  Okay?

So, if the relationship's ending, they have got to make sure that everybody knows it's not their fault and it's all your fault.  So they are now going to the next person that they are grooming, their new partner, and they are doing a total smear of your personality and character.  You are the devil in disguise, and they are quite happy to talk about it.  Then to your face, they project everything.  So you are confronting them and saying, why are you treating me like this?  Why are you cheating?  What's wrong with me?  And they, at first, might not answer you.  They give you the silent treatment.

But then they might say, okay, you want to know?  It's because you are this way, you are this way, you are this way.  And they project all of the problems onto you.  It's all your fault.  And they accuse you of stuff you have never even known.  Stuff you have never even dreamed of doing.  And often it's because they are already doing it themselves.

But they are accusing you of what they are doing, but making it sound like you are the one doing it.  So that's the projection that they do.  And then they start this damage control.  So they put stuff on Facebook about how terrible you are, and they put pictures of this new person they are with, and everybody's happy, and it makes them look like they hit the jackpot.  And they are the hero again.  And they are doing damage control on their image.  So that's the three parts of the cycle.  Okay?  Now I want to dig into this discard stage a little bit.  Because many of you have been there, and you know that it is a very, very difficult thing.  So I want to come in at two angles.  So if you are the one that a narcissist discards, okay?  They get rid of you.  Usually it's very sudden.  It's like flipping the switch.  One day we are done.  Say that we are done, and they are gone.  And usually they move very quickly in with somebody else.  It's one relationship to another.  They are not ending it with you until they got somebody else set up.  Okay?  So that is what begins to happen.  So yesterday they might have said to you, I love you.  Today I hate you.  And it's done.  So it's a shock for a lot of people.  So there's no closure for you.  There's no explanation given other than it's all your fault.  There's no answering your questions.  There's no helping make sense out of that.  And so you might beg them to explain silent treatment.  No answers given.  It is done.  And so you are left there.  Now often what happens at this time when they dump you is their beautiful image mask comes off.  All of a sudden they are not able to maintain this wonderful personality.  And there's a coldness, a cruelty that comes out.  And you see it maybe for the first time.  And there's no remorse.  There's no concern about your feelings.  It's done.  I am gone.  Okay?  So that's if they discard you.  Now the one I want to really focus on is if you discard them.  And that is a whole big topic.  So if you have been in a relationship with a narcissist, the ideal thing for you to do is to end it and then have no contact.  Because you want to know what happens next.  Because you want to know what happens if you allow contact to a narcissist.  That means I have another chance.  They are listening to me.  I can plant a seed in their brain.  I can twist their thinking.  I have an opportunity.  And they will do that.  And if they have beaten your self-image down, you will listen to it.  And it will influence you.  So no contact is the ideal.  Now you might be in a place where you cannot have no contact because you have kids together.  So you have to have some contact.  So the term that is used for what your response should be is called, be a gray rock.  I do not know if you have heard of it, but just stop and think about it.  What color are rocks?  Gray.  So be a gray rock means do not stand out.  Blend in.  So if they say, how are you doing?  You say, fine.  They are waiting for you to ask how they are doing.  And you do not even ask them how they are doing because you do not care.  Because you are not going to give them an opportunity for a second to say one thing that might influence your thinking.  So gray rock means do not stand out by saying stuff or asking questions.  Because if you do not stand out, be almost unidentifiable to them.
