Hi, welcome back to Therapy Chat.  I am your host, Laura Regan, and today I am so happy to be joined once again by Dr.  Lindsay Gibson.  Lindsay, thank you so much for coming back to Therapy Chat today.  Oh, it's a pleasure to be back.  Thank you, Laura.  Yes, I am so happy to be talking about your newest book, Disentangling from Emotionally Immature People.  I will just hold it up for the camera and why it's so difficult to disentangle from emotionally immature people.  So before we get into it, though, will you just tell our audience a little bit more about who you are and what you do?  Sure.  I am a psychologist and I have been a psychotherapist for well over 30 years now.  I also do coaching.  Okay.  And I have, I think it's five books now.  Probably, I just cannot seem to stop doing it.  Probably the best known is Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents.  And that turned into a series.  And then this most recent book, The Disentangling from Emotionally Immature People, kind of broadens that out.  We go from talking about the parents to everybody who is emotionally immature in your life.  Yes.  So we talk about people in general that have emotional immaturity.  And it's a topic that I just cannot get enough of because it's endlessly fascinating to me how different these people are from people who are just adequately emotionally mature.  Like, I do not think that there's not a continuum in this setting.  Right.  In the sense that, you know, all the way at the bottom, they are the emotionally immature people, and then all the way at the top, they are the emotionally mature.  You know, we are on a continuum, right?  And emotionally immature people, when we get sick or tired or stressed, we become less emotionally mature in our functioning.  So we can, you know, that marker can move.

But there are a few characteristics of emotional immaturity that are really important.  And, and, and that's, that's a big part of our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our focused on I amnsaturokraty.  That are really kind of hallmarks that if a person has those characteristics, we might consider them to be, you know, sort of, , , an emotionally immature personality.  Because if you have adequate maturity, you are not going to have these problems.  You are not going to have these characteristics so we, we, we can talk about that more, you know, about what those characteristics are, but, just find it fascinating that these people often cause so much pain and so much frustration in the people that they are in relationship with.  And I have just sort of, you know, made it my life study to help people understand what's going on with that, because you can really feel bad about yourself and even wonder if you are crazy or if you are inadequate because of the difficulties there are in relationships with emotionally immature people.  And what I found is that when people get a little bit of information about where they are coming from and how they are functioning and why, it's just so empowering.  I mean, they get back a sense of, , you know, that's what's going on.  Now I understand why they are this way.  And it gives them some observational distance and it allows them to really see the situation much more objectively.  Yes.  Well, thank you.  And it is confusing when, and you know, I do not know, I guess we do fluctuate in how mature we may be feeling in given stages and points in our lives, but you know, I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  I do not know.  , can you help us sort of, can you paint a picture of what the characteristics are of someone who kind of tends toward that being emotionally immature?  , so people can, you know, if for anybody who's not familiar with your work, just have a sense of what we are really talking about.  Yes.  , sure.  , I just want to mention that it's absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely possible for a person who in their emotional development has stayed kind of, , immature.  They have not continued to grow up, , emotionally.  It's perfectly possible that in other areas of their development, they did grow up.  They, they successfully achieved a certain amount of, , development and maturity in those areas, like their intellectual development.  I mean, you could be a college professor, you could be, , running a successful business, you could be very intelligent, you could be a physicist.  Okay.  That has nothing to do with your emotional maturity.  And similarly, a person can have really good social development.  You know, they can be the most popular person in the group.  They can be well thought of.  They can be a leader in the community, but when they get home and they are in the, you know, kind of the, the intimate, , , realm of personal relationship, and they get stressed or, you know, somebody, , does not want to do what they say, then you are going to see this immaturity start coming out in the privacy of the home or when they think no one's looking.  Yes.

So, yes.  So anyway, , but I just wanted to say that so that people understood that they are, they are confusing people because they can be so well-functioning in other areas.  And they can have their good days and their, you know, more emotionally available days too.  So people get very confused with thinking, well, you know, they are not like this, you know, every second of every day, sometimes, you know, it feels pretty good with them.

But let's talk about some of the characteristics that really make it tough, , to have a relationship in which you can be yourself with them.  Okay.  And you can feel like you are not going to be the same person that you were when you were a kid.  And you can feel like you are not going to be the same person that you were when you were a kid.  And you can feel like they are actually seeing you and attending to you as a real person because emotionally immature people have a big problem with even recognizing the subjective experience of other people.  , I mean, they see you, they interact with you, but they do not have the kind of imaginative experience of, of what it must be like on the inside of you.  In other words, their empathy is usually pretty poor.  , and that's again, a lack of this imaginative capacity that we have.  If you are adequately emotionally mature, we can sort of, , put ourselves in the shoes of the other person.  We can imagine how something's going to affect them.  And, and that is something that comes very naturally, very automatically when you have matured to a certain level in your emotional development.

But for emotionally immature people, they, they just do not get it that there's an inside world.  , they do not understand that they are not attuned to it.  , they tend to, we had talked about this earlier, but you know, they tend to get very concrete, , you know, dealing with it.  , and they tend to get very concrete, , you know, dealing with what they would consider the facts, , dealing with the physical, the material, the tangible and, you know, stuff that goes on inside you, the emotional, , even, even the spiritual, even the, , you know, the, the sense of, , art and, , you know, kind of uplift feeling, you know, these, these other wonderful inside world feelings, they do not get that.  That's not interesting to them.  They think it's a good thing.  They think it's a waste of time because there's no utilitarian value in it.  And there's no utilitarian value in any of us having, you know, an inner world.

But if you want to have relationships, if you want to have meaningful work, if you want to be fulfilled in your life, you have to have that inner world.  So the emotionally immature person kind of comes at life in a very egocentric way.  Very self-centered.  They know they are real, but you know, other people and things that go on outside of them just are not that interesting to them.  All roads lead back to them.  And if you have ever tried to have a conversation with them, you will find that even if they appear to be interested in you at first, it will not be long before they have found a way to bring the topic back to the thing that they want to talk about or something about it.  Yes, I mean, you know, people who are on a a Mohla- are moving towards audience being able tooded at themselves.  It's a very reliable indicator of emotional immaturity.  They also have very poor self reflection.  They just do not think about their behavior.  Whew And like I said, they do not have the imagination and the empathy to have a sense of how they are impacting other people.  They just do not get it.  It's about… yes.  You have some kind of self-reflection.  And Laura, by self-reflection, I do not mean that they know, for instance, they say something like, oh, I am so bossy, or I am the oldest child, so I am bossy.  They might know some things about themselves.  That's not the same thing as self-reflection.  Self-reflection, because they will say, yes, I know I am so bossy, I am a brat.  Are they thinking about really what that means?  Are they intending to change that?  Absolutely not.  They just know it about themselves.

But without that self-reflection, we cannot change ourselves.  We are not interested in changing ourselves.  And if you cannot do that, you cannot apologize.  You cannot make reflections.  You cannot make reflections.  Repairs in relationships, it's a real death knell to intimacy in a relationship, which makes a lot of sense for an emotionally immature person because they are really scared of emotional intimacy.  They do not dig it at all.  They like to keep things on the level of events, actions, facts.  Plans.  They do not want to go into, let's talk about how each of us is feeling.  Let's share our thoughts.  Let's get to know each other at a deeper level.  Their view would be, what for?  Like, why are you doing all this touchy-feely stuff?  Well, we are doing it because if you do have the capacity for emotional intimacy, you do want to be in a relationship.  You do want to be in a relationship.  You do want to be in a relationship.  You do want to be known.  And you want to know other people.  And you want to see and be seen.  You know, so you have that wonderful feeling of connection.  Like, you know, we got to know each other a little bit better.

But the emotionally immature person is not into that at all.  They tend to see it as what I feel is what is real.  So I do not really need to do a lot of investigation.  I do not need to do a lot of investigation.  I do not need to do a lot of communication or listening to you, because I pretty much know what I know about you.  And I would be happy to tell you.  And we do not have to waste time with all this communication stuff, because I know I am right.  That's the emotionally immature position.  And it makes it extremely frustrating and demoralizing when you are trying to have a deeper relationship with a person like that.  And then finally, the emotionally immature person has a really sort of idiosyncratic approach to reality.  Anything they do not like, anything that makes them nervous, they will tend to deny it, dismiss it, or distort it.  They interpret reality on the basis of how it makes them feel.  So if you tell your parent, for instance, Jacques – « « you just say.  » « Well, I just must be the worst mother ever.  » « you just I cannot do anything right.  Why are you so mad at me all the time.  » because the mother felt stung that she was being, quote, reprimanded.  And so on the basis of her feelings, with this extreme reaction.

But what's really going on is that she has interpreted reality on the basis of her vulnerability to rejection or shame or whatever it is.  And she's come back in that very emotionally reactive way.  And meanwhile, you just did not want the corn cob to go to eat.  Yes, you are like, do not break my sink because we need to be able to run water through this thing.  Exactly.  Yes, but so it's often, you know, that's what gives rise to that feeling like, you know, you are walking on eggshells or, you know, you have to be very careful with them because they get so reactive.  Right.  And it's like.  In my experience in.  Relating with someone who is how you describe is.  There's not.  There's not like a sense of openness about different perspectives or.  So anything that's being said that's like being curious about a different way of looking at it or just even.  Expanding on an idea is seen as kind of like an annoying extra talking that does not need to be happening.  I love that.  That is so it.  Annoying extra talking that does not need to be happening.  That's it.  Exactly.  So then you become like the annoying mosquito that they are like swatting away.  And all you are trying to do is like.  Actually have a conversation that is not just them making an announcement or pronouncement about something and you.  It's like I am just trying to be here.  To as part of this relationship.  It feels like.  Exactly.

Let me in.  Exactly.  Yes, that's really well put.  I am just trying to be here too.  And from the other person's point of view from the emotionally immature person's point of view.  It's kind of like well, why are you trying to be here too?  I will tell you what you need to know.  I will.  I will lead us.  I will inform you.  I will tell you what to do next.  It's like why are you trying to.  Like insinuate yourself into this relationship?  And of course, we know that we are trying.  We are not trying to, you know, wiggle our way into something.  We are trying to share or talk or, you know, have some kind of relation-based communication and connection.

But from their point of view, yes, I mean does it feels like a waste of time because they already know what they know.  And they already know how you should be.  And they.  They are happy to tell you that.

But they.  Yes, I mean curious or opening up about, you know, new things about each other or trying to have a discussion.  That holds no appeal to them at all.  In fact, it's frightening.  Yes, because they feel or they need to feel like they know everything already.  And their worldview is extremely rigid.  You know, if you think of like.  You know, a circle is 360 degrees, you know, their little arc of perception is like three degrees.  And inside that they know everything there is to know about everything.  And so when you try to come in and say, you know, oh, there's this whole other circle.  There's this whole other area.  I would like for you to get to know me better.  Why, they would think.  Why are we doing this?  -.  We already know.  I already know who you are.  You are my son.  You are my daughter.  Yes.  Yes.  And then when you are talking about when it's a parent that's like this and the child is constantly challenging the way they expect things to be, the way the parent expects things to be, the child is doing things that the parent would not have done, did not.  Did not imagine could happen, you know.  It's like this, whoa, why are you doing this to me?  Like, but, you know, I can see how when the child is saying like, I just, I am.  Like they call bids for connection, right?  It's just a way to get, yes, just for you to feel that I am also here and not just you being like in your head.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  That, that need is often the basis of a lot of people.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  It, it can be, it can sometime call that anxiety or that, oh my God, that rush surprised an empty physically.  It can be a sort of pretty strong, and it can be a little bit tempting because you start something can be a little spooky, but another time when you are, you know, she lunch breaks looks like in- Lori is going up asking you for Shalva one of my.  Always been.  Always been, she was saying like, this is my?  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  It makes me feel like if I if I never used to, if I looked on top of this thing, and seeing how people have really lost their stir, capacity if you are interested and you have empathy and you want to relate to another person at a deeper level and be known at that deeper level it's yes it's very very disappointing very demoralizing to have someone come back with that attitude of not having really any curiosity about anything in depth and they jump to a conclusion really fast and it's very hard to communicate with people like that yes that part about jumping to a conclusion too with parenting it's like you are just a demanding child or you are you know you are like the way that there can be a very simplistic oh i know that i am not sure if i am going to be able to answer that question but i think it's like i am this way like i want deep connection with people and i have family members who let's say not to call anyone out on the podcast but let's say one of my caregivers is really a lot like you are describing just this sort of lack of their caring but they have a lack of really understanding about anyone else's inner world so they will say things like do you think that people just get depressed i do not know i do not think people are depressed they are just depressed and they cannot not feel that way and it's like yes i mean of course it can change but i do believe that that's real that people can feel that way and then they will say i do not know i guess i just have had a really good life i just do not understand that and and then i know objectively that their life really was not like all that good like growing up so it's like it's more like a fixable function for us to process and i know that would be for best and worst of both fighters okay so question number two what are the goes until you are sadly clouds can make yourself unhappy because they bring up light and like you know oh yes i am anxious you know or you want to know and see what happens and all the arts are going off and so on so go after yourself and the somewhat fluid way of doing things or the old the old way of thinking about things and that's good but i think one of the great things that you learn is that you it's your mind has to be open so let's blood do the most useful you know so when we say the most useful thing and more i am telling this is the flow hinears upon each other right yes that's an interesting thinking thing okay so i think but i do not think if i have toあ全部 excited because then all the people who have a lot of superficial i just do not think about it i i move on i you know there is no reflective depth there's no there's no shadowing there's no yes perspective it's it's just like things are very much on the surface and of course if you see the world that way it's really easy to to make snap decisions and to see things in black and white right and wrong good and bad which is a nightmare when you are a child and your parent is sizing you up like that you know these very extreme categories based on whether or not they like what you are doing that's you know that's hard on the self-esteem yes yes it was yes and and if you if you see the way i look at it is in order to be a whole person we really are equipped and made to use both our right and left hemispheres of our brain you know we need you know some problem solving we need some categorizing abstract sequential thought we need to be analytical that's all great but we need our depth man we really need to be able to have intuition have imagination feel our way into situations you know have an instinct about something have a that's just deeper than what my social role is so ideally i mean i mean they have done so much research on brain functioning and what happens when people have injuries to one side or the other the brain and you know so it's kind of been proven that if you are not using a part of your brain enough you are really missing out on the full yes the full experience of being a human being who can be in relationship with other people i mean it's a big to me it's a big deal it is not just that that these people are you know kind of difficult or you know they are a little bit frustrating it's a whole thing about how their mind and how their brain works or does not work and that's probably related to some kind of trauma having to do with attachment or security and that all has to come from the right hemisphere of the brain i mean you know babies and mothers relate to each other through right hemisphere resonance or kind of you know that attunement okay but if you have problems with that early in life and maybe that that mother is not or that mothering person i should say maybe that person is not sensitive and maybe they are not attuned well over time that child might learn oh you know the right side of my brain is not a safe place for me to hang out because i go into all these feelings and i get these intuitions and i you know and and people look at me like i have two heads so maybe it just would be better if i became like them and stayed over here in the left hemisphere more you know be very logical be very you know categorized black and white like that i mean i i think that's that's a that's a very important thing to be able to do and it's not a big deal to be able to do that because you know it's not a big deal to be able to do that but it's a big deal to be able to do that so it to me it's it's a very big deal because it means when you are emotionally immature that you are not using the full complement of what your brain is designed to do which is to use both sides and both types of abilities yes i i i really see what you mean and i and i will say for myself like with with my parents and i i was a very emotional person and i was very emotional and sensitive so i had a lot of stress and i was very emotional and sensitive and i was very emotional and sensitive for me there was like i think i was very emotional and sensitive and then became very kind of locked down and like disconnected from my emotions as a way to cope and then you know it was a very difficult process to come back to feeling my emotions but when because you know i even noticed how in like in my marriage i would be when taking care of little kids and working and all the things like things can just become very transactional like it's like oh who's picking up this and what's for dinner and how are we you know do we need to go the grocery store and like you know just sort of passing but without that i am not a very emotional person you know i am not a very emotional person and i do not have a lot of time but it's special to what we do and why we do it at home and that's what makes really helping that make that veryapa important we are with an angela and we are with a lot ofTravis.  Sandra jangan we love you that means so much to us and to the parents of these amazing young babies so and we just want to thank you for talking with us and it was such a pleasure not so just a pleasure as usual thanks joe so much about being here so i am reallyятся an honor being here that was lovely it is our pleasure that you helped us to join this Nicola Howell family so i want to acknowledge Nurian and the whole team of the the mom and rice family on the right a donkey for helping us learn about Adv터� and myself and i will stop at the end of the presentation tapestry that's just woven together in a beautiful way even though there's a lot of pain you know but there's also joy and happiness and sadness and fear and anger and all the feelings it just feels so much more alive to be that way it is i mean it is so much more alive because you are using everything in yourself which was designed to be used it was designed to be experienced not only because it's nice and not only because you know these feelings are wonderful and meaningful you know there's that's a big word with this i think that the meaning comes from all these values and and abilities of the right hemisphere we we it feels meaningful to us and if you do not have that then you begin to lose your sense of you know basic meaning in life and then that leads into a particular kind of depression that is you know i mean it's very hard to to come back from that if you get too far away from you know those more internal gifts that we all have well i appreciate the way you described the the characteristics of someone who is emotionally immature and i hear and we have talked about not only today but in our previous interview too how it can change it's not a fixed state of being someone who is emotionally immature can change right that can change for them if if they have self-reflection you know when people ask me you know can they change or will they change yes if if they are capable of self-reflecting or you know something happens in their life that sort of makes them self-reflect you know because it's like they cannot get out of that box that they are in they are not just going to say i want to become curious about myself it has to be something yes it might it might be external yes you know it might come in with the spouse saying they are leaving or you know they might you know end up on the wrong side of the law or whatever and some judge says you know you need to be in treatment i mean there are ways that they get to being self-reflective but i just wanted to mention that because that's such an important criterion for whether or not a person will change yes they have to see that there's something missing to want to make a change yes exactly yes otherwise why would you right especially if you already think everything's you are doing is right and it's the other people that are the problem exactly so in relationship and i i will not go into this part too much because i feel like it's interesting how even though i have a parent who's like that and my other parent is different you know i am i did not i had an interruption in my emotional development and then was able to work with it you know because something did not feel satisfying to me so i guess there was enough of the budding self-awareness that was coming to the surface for me to catch that but you know it's it's hard when you have that upbringing and then your siblings might be the same way as the parent was or that's just not the case for me i think it's it's hard to be like that and then you know that's a way that they have all adapted to you know the way the parent was so it can make it really hard to have close sibling relationships close friendships and i guess you do not have to choose to be friends with people who are not interested in deep connection but your siblings are like they are already there they are like you did not really get to choose them right so it can be really hard to be in relationship with people who are functioning in that way and do not see anything wrong with it and you know it's like like you mentioned early in our discussion today it can feel we can gaslight ourselves like what am i doing wrong with this person you know i am trying to like to let them know what i need in this relationship or how what's not working for me and they are just like why are you talking to me you know so that's where i feel like your book here is so beneficial this particular newest book and how to disentangle from people who are emotionally immature because it's like you try to figure out how to set a boundary or what to say and the person just kind of does not it does not seem to register they either ignore it what i said to you before we started recording was like they just kind of override what you said disregard it and then you know for me when that has happened i am like what's what am i getting wrong here what why cannot i understand boundaries why cannot i set boundaries it's like really that it makes it kind of brings like that child part back for me like where i am like oh i am lost i have no idea what to do now i tried something it's not getting me anywhere so can you talk a little bit about that yes yes this this this is a topic that's really near and dear to my heart because i think that again if if you are just looking at it from a standpoint of you know sort of cognitive or cognitive behavioral approaches to situations like this it would be you know set the boundary tell them you know it's taken care of but yes that's a sound that's what they say set a boundary okay yes set that boundary and then my problem will be solved yes the problem is that the other person does not hear it or they do not respond to it and so you set the boundary and they go on like you have not said anything or they say oh do not be ridiculous or they dismiss yes they dismiss it in some way i did not do that he did not do that he did not mean that i did not mean that you know they they dismiss it and they distort what happened because they are really not interested in learning about how it felt to you or why you would want to set this boundary that is not interesting to them they do not get it so when people are given that message that you just need to set the boundary i think they also need to be given the message that you may end up feeling very frustrated like you cannot make yourself heard you cannot make yourself understood sprinkleно like to their own Flame peace and means no i could recognize the loneliness moment when we talk about setting boundaries, you can get people ready for that by doing imagined encounters where they, you know, talk to an imaginary person or it could be their boss, it could be a parent, but they get some practice in actually saying things to them that are setting boundaries.  Or you can role play with them as a therapist.

But you are trying to get them sort of ready to speak up to, you know, take a more active position, which is hard with emotionally immature people, because they shut other people down really fast.  I mean, some of them are very assertive in the way that they shut people down.  Other people shut them down by dismissing them, or acting like they are being silly, or, you know, just disregarding it.

But I always, let people know that their job is to just try to set the boundary.  It's not their job to guarantee that the other person hears it or respects it.  That's another task.  Okay.

But being able to say it is moving yourself out of this kind of enforced passive position that emotionally immature people often put their family members into.  Like, you are supposed to be passive and go along with whatever I think is right.

But when you start to set boundaries, you are really moving into a much more assertive and active relationship vis-a-vis them.  You just cannot depend on them to hear you or want to understand.  That is not within your control.  And so when people come back in a session with a kind of a hang dog look and say, you know, like, I tried, I tried, but, you know, they just blew me off.  It's like, yes, of course they did.  That's what they do.  And of course you are feeling bad about yourself, but let's look at what happened.  And I tell people a lot that, you know, if a person wants to understand what you are saying, it really does not matter how you say it.  Okay?  -huh.  If a person, , does not want to understand what you are saying, it also does not matter how you say it.  Okay?  The reception of your message depends on the other person's worldview and the other person's receptivity.  And that you do not have control over.  So boundary setting probably needs to be repeated, you know, with as little reactivity as possible.  And then you cannot control it.  And you cannot control it.  You cannot control it.  You cannot control it.  You cannot control it.  You cannot control it.  It's lost.  It's sort of over and over and over again, and it pops up over here and it pops up over there and you would keep the boundary and you repeat the boundary.  And your goal is to try to not be reactive because it's frustrating when you have told somebody something or you have explained, you know, we, we always think that an explanation is going to solve the problem.  Not if the other person's not listening, , not if they are not wanting to step inside your shoes it does not work that way yes so is it is it possible i mean is it possible to have boundaries with people who are like this and i guess like what do you what do people end up doing like is it is it like you just have to break things off some people do that although i am never the one to encourage anybody to move into estrangement because i think there's so much good practice that can happen as long as you are having some contact with the people and i see here that there's a lot of good growth that can can happen when you are in therapy and you still are in touch with your your family or your family and you are still in touch with your family or your family and you are still in touch with your your family or your family or your family or your family or your your family or your family or your family or your family or your person so i am you know i think people sometimes get the mistaken idea that i am all for estrangement i am not i am if the person's being abused or if there's something about that person that they just cannot handle yes there are conditions but my client's the one who's going to decide that not me i am not pushing one way or the other yes so so when you are going to when you are going to to make a boundary or set a boundary i encourage them to think about it in terms of you are not doing something against that person you are only trying to get space for yourself always look at it in terms of space it's not that you are you know shutting them out or not letting them do something it's like you are just trying to get you know space for living space for yourself and you have to make it very remember how concrete and and you know and specific they are you have to make it something that's pretty simple that does not have a lot of explanation i mean you can try to explain it once or twice or 10 times but if they are not interested like i said and they are not listening that needs to be a part of the conversation and the conversation needs to be a part of the conversation to be abandoned and it needs to be short and sweet and repeated ad infinitum that this is what i can tolerate or this is what you can do in our house or this is what i want to do about you know thanksgiving or christmas and then that needs to be repeated many times because you know remember it's like three degrees of the circle they are only focused in on what they want and they really do hang on to that until you have repeatedly set that limit in a very specific kind of way and do not try to give give them insight or understanding about the reasons behind it that just confuses them it makes them they have no idea what why you are saying this why you are doing this to them so it just works better if you keep it clean and you are not just trying to keep it clean and you are not just trying to keep it clean keep your reactivity down and repeat repeat repeat and then when you feel deceited and you know bad about how they did not listen to you that's what you expect that's them right it's not a call for you to go passive and give up on yourself it's a call for you to get specific and definite and repetitive with them which are all active coping mechanisms okay yes you do not it's not good to give up and when you keep at it in a non-reactive way sooner or later i i think a new norm gets set up because you just do not do it and if you say you are not going to do it and you do not do it a new norm eventually gets set up yes well do you think that so with specifically talking about emotionally immature people as you are defining them here do you think that they will honor the boundary that's set if you continue to say no i am doing it this way or whatever yes i would not call it honoring i think it's a good thing because that's that suggests an empathy or a respect for the other person that i do not think is probably there i think that over time it's it's kind of like just think that like little kids you know they do not say oh yes mother i understand that that you know this is important to you and therefore i am not going to do it anymore they are going to keep trying until they learn that you know this is important for me and this is not going to happen and so that's what that explains yes a question for me is do the parents think about what it's ashamed of do the parents get dares the grandparents think about what that means yes so they get right no matter how many times i go on about this i am not winning and so then a new norm gets established but it's it's not easy and it's not something that comes do not do not have to get emotionally reactive to it either -huh yes it's that's tough i mean i think managing the the feelings that come up when you know you are you know it's like that dynamic of one person being just like no and i do not get why you do not understand this and the other person's like they are having like all these feelings and they are like i am trying to reach you i am trying to reach it was just like you know i am like turning away like what's your problem stop stirring the pot you know or whatever right every everything was fine before right you are talking you are talking again there's too much words i am trying to stay in my own head and do what i want and you are kind of this annoying mosquito yes absolutely yes yes that's it but i i want to like amplify one point you said that you do not encourage people to stay in relationships where they are being abused because when i when i interview people about this type of dynamic i often hear some feedback about you know sort of like that there's more concern for the person the emotionally immature person than the person that is affected by their behavior and you know what i mean like why why is it okay for them to act like that and you know like that it's not sensitive to the experience of the other person in the in the relationship and i am not saying i do not think anything in our conversation is like that but i just want people to heal here very clearly that you know you are not neither of us is saying people should or have to stay in a relationship with anyone who's being abusive towards them you do not have to keep trying to set a boundary with someone who's being abusive towards you if you you know if you do not feel safe yes and and even i mean that's that's a pretty clear-cut situation but there are other situations where you know i have had people who just cannot stand to be around their parent i mean that they have experienced the parent as creepy or they experience the parent as you know going across boundaries or being intrusive and and that's you know maybe it's not technically abused per se but it's they just do not like to be around it and so what i will say to people is i will just bring up the the fact that they do not have to have a visit right now or they do not have to respond right now and i you know kind of leave it at that that they can take breaks they can you know not have contact for a while like i i had a client once that had a new baby and you know she was it was everything she could do to keep her sanity with this new baby and her father who's a very was a very disruptive life character okay and so as you may have recognized she was playing everybody around with a big fight she was brewing me up with a deal and yet our child has the wedding she had and you know she has to make things that simple right now and make it that she can stay alive and you know even when i get mixed переп latitude she was you know Español her surrogacy could cost away a lot of money ended there was maybebr antibodies just to make her Wu yours to stay alive by za gay right now.  Yes.  I love that, that you are, you are describing the sort of the way the relationship is and with someone who's emotionally immature is that they are taking up all the space in the relationship and there's really no space for you to be you.  And that the, to disentangle is to allow for space where you get to be you and then you can decide how you want to be in relationship with them.  Yes.  Yes.  Because, , the emotionally immature person entangles with other people because they do not have a really good sense of self.  They kind of merge with other people or they just associate with other people.  And so I think that's, I think that's a really good way to put it.  Yes.  And I think that's a really good way to put it.  Yes.  I think that's a really good way to put it.  Yes.  I think that's a really good way to put it.  Yes.  And so if you assume other people are like them and they assume that they are going to be there to, you know, help them with their emotional stabilization or shore up their self-esteem, I mean, that's the entangling part.  Like I need you to make me feel good about myself and to keep me, you know, feeling calm.  I need you to be the person who makes me feel that way.  And so if you are tired of doing that and you want to stop doing that, that's something that is very hard for them to let go.  You know, they are not going to release you, say, oh honey, I am so sorry that, you know, I put you in this position of always having to take care of me emotionally.  They have no idea that they are doing it.  So yes, it's hard to, it's hard to sort of remember that you have to take care of yourself and maintain a connection to yourself first and foremost before you, you know, step in to help anybody else.  And there are lots of times, like I say, where you need to create that space where you can have a connection with yourself.  Because people who lose themselves get depressed.  They do not function very well.  It's not a good scene.  Yes, so true.  So true.  Well, you know, again, I appreciate the work that you have been doing to really illuminate this dynamic and help people who are in relationship with emotionally immature people to kind of have a perspective of why it feels like this, and their relationships and what they can do about it.  And you are approaching this in so many ways, like you said, this being your fifth book.  And as we talked before, there's like two more in the pipeline already.  By the time, you know, by the time this airs, well, people will almost be able to maybe pre-order some of them.  So thank you for everything and also the brand new course you are doing too.  You are doing a course on this book, right?  Yes.  I think that started a couple of weeks ago.  It may have closed out its sign up at this point, but they are going to continue to do sign ups for it.  And that's been fun because it's been a way of me just talking to the people who are interested in this whole topic.  And we talk a lot about the impact of emotionally immature parents on their adult children and what you can do to address that.  So it's sort of a, it's like a, kind of like a talking video book.  Yes.  Where I get to, you know, talk directly to people about some of the things that they are doing.  And it's not just about what we are doing here.  It's just about what we are doing here.  So it's just like, what we are doing here.  Yes.  Well, I know that that is, I just recently found out about it.  So I started, I shared it like this week, but I do not know.  Hopefully people will still be able to find out when it's going to be opening back up again.

But Lindsay, just thank you so much for everything you are doing to help this change.  Because I think there are a lot of people who, who are raising kids who did not get what they needed when they were young.  And you know, we all want to do better when we know better.  Well, hopefully it almost all of us want to, or for those of us who do, it's really, it's really valuable what you are putting out into the world.  And I am very grateful that you took the time to come back to therapy chat today.  Oh, well, thank you for having me.  It's always such a pleasure to talk to you.  I am so happy to talk with you, Laura.  Oh, thank you.  So sweet to say that.  And, and so where can people find all of your stuff?  Yes.  On my website, which is lindsaygibsonpsyd.  Com.  That's my website.  They can have, find information about the books and there's some of my writings and things like that.  And then on TikTok, I am, I am going to be posting a lot of my stuff on there.  I am doing a lot of speaking under Academy of Self-Help.  There's a group of, of us therapists who are doing a TikTok presence and I am going to be coming more into social media in the next few weeks.  So that will be something that that will be coming up.  I have actually managed to not do that all this time.

But now I have, I have a lot of time.  I am going to be posting a lot of my stuff on there.  And I know I have, I have someone who's helping me with that.  So that will be coming up.  Fun.  It's such a good way to reach so many more people.  And it's amazing how people are using TikTok and Instagram videos to.  Yes, it's really good stuff.  I mean, I have, I have gone through it and I love TikTok and I go through and it's like, that's really good.  I know it's, you know, some in our field are really dismissive of what people are doing.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  You know, it's a little bit of a thing.  It's like, you know, we do not know if it's a good thing or not.  We, we have a lot of people who are finding on social media, but I think that that's a very reductive way of looking at things because, you know, we think, oh, social media, it's bad for everyone.  Well, no, there are a lot of people who are accessing information that they would never have had a way to find if not for social media.  So.  Yes, exactly.  And, you know, I, I think the way that it's presented in these, you know, these short you know and and it and it sticks with you you do not have to go through this you know pages of explication you know if somebody gets gets the that nugget of truth into a you know 30 second or a two minute thing it like really sticks with you never forget it i know and sometimes they are funny and sometimes there's music and dancing and so it's just like you cannot go wrong what's the what's that's right well thank you again lindsey i am so grateful that you came back to therapy chat and i hope when your next books come out we will have you back again oh i would love it thank you so much laura.
