Mp3 **Language:** en (confidence: 1.  00) **Duration:** 2962.  09 seconds **Processed:** Tue Jun 3 PM UTC 2025 ## Transcript Well, welcome to another Friday night.  We have been doing a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, and today I want to come at it from a different angle that I hope will be quite helpful for you.  I want you to see that many of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma are actually tools that people with complex trauma use in order to cope with life in order to get things done.  They may not be healthy tools, but for most in complex trauma it was the only tools they were given, and so they have accumulated growing up a toolbox of tools, and many of the tools are the characteristics of complex trauma.  So when it comes to how do we learn tools for coping and learning how to live in life, we really get it kind of three different ways.  Our parents can teach us explicitly.  Do it this way, here's how you handle this, or we can just observe how other people handle things, and so we learn by watching our role models, or third we can be in a survival mode, and so our brain just goes to what it needs to do to get safe right away.  So an instant safety type of tool, and what happens for most in complex trauma is they are building a tool box of unhealthy tools that let them survive and cope in the short run, but when they get to adult life those tools are not working anymore.  They are causing problems now in relationships, in jobs, in parenting, and so they need to revisit their toolbox and realize that many of the tools are not healthy, and then begin to figure out what healthy tools are, and so what I want to do is walk you through the unhealthy tools that you may have picked up in your toolbox.  So we are going to go through your toolbox and you can check off the ones that are part of your toolbox as I go through lists, but let me, as a background, just say this, we need tools in three different areas specifically.  So number one, we need tools that will help us deal with extreme emotional pain, so a deep hurt, a deep loss, depression, deep emotional pain.  So we will accumulate tools to deal with that, and so for a person coming from trauma, that's deep emotional pain.  So many of your first tools you picked up because of the trauma, the deep emotional hurt, and pain.  Secondly, we have tools that help us respond to unpleasant emotions, so if we are feeling stressed, if we are feeling agitated or angry or embarrassed, any uncomfortable emotion, we do not like, and our brain looks for tools to get rid of it, and so we will have tools for dealing with uncomfortable emotions, and then thirdly, we have tools or accumulate tools on ways to get our needs met, and so we always talk about the 12 needs that everybody has, and so you will have a set of tools, healthy, unhealthy, a blend for how to get your needs met.  So let's start with the tools that we develop to respond to trauma, tools that respond to deep pain, deep hurt, and I want to give you 22 tools that you may have been taught, had role modeled for you, and again you can check off the ones that are true of you.  So number one was, big boys do not cry, you might have heard that, and so basically it was, if you show weakness, that's bad because people will use that against you and you will get hurt, and so what you are taught is the way to handle deep hurt is stuff it down.  Do not reveal any weakness by crying.  Secondly, some of you are told, or given the impression that dealing with a deep hurt or a deep loss should only take you a couple days and then you should be over it, it should be done.  So you might have heard, are not you done crying yet, or just get over it.  And so what you began to feel is that it took you longer than a couple days to deal with a deep hurt or loss, then you were not a good person for continuing to have to grieve or work through a loss.  The third one, some of you got, was you began to feel like you were a burden to others if you had a problem.  And so if you had a deep hurt or a deep loss, people would help you for a couple days, but after that you are now becoming a burden.  So you began to believe that you have to handle deep hurt and loss alone.  You cannot burden others with your problems.  A fourth one that you might have grown up with is if you are going through deep hurt and deep loss, do not feel it just distract yourself.  So stay super busy, work all the time, or go on long TV marathons, or shopping, anything to distract you from feeling.  Some of you when you grew up and you went through deep pain, it was not validated.  Rather it was minimized.  You might have heard, do not make such a big deal out of it.  Or you might have kind of had minimization through comparison.  Be thankful you are not going through what people in Africa are going through.  So your pain is not as great as there, so get over it.  They minimized it.  Or your pain is not as bad as what I am going through.  All of those were minimizations, or they might have denied it.  They did not allow you to talk about it.  They might have even said, oh that did not really happen.  You are making that up.  Or you might have heard, you know what, that's in the past.  It's water under the bridge.  Time to turn a new chapter.  So now we are not going to talk about this anymore.  Some of you, the tool of survival was you dissociated.  The pain was too great.  You could not resolve it.  You did not have tools for that.  The only tool you had was to dissociate, to turn into an internal safe place, which became a place of not feeling or escaping into a fantasy world.  A make belief world where everything was without pain.  Everything was beautiful.  Some of you had role models where they medicated the pain.  Or if you were in pain, one of your parents or grandparents may have said here, here's a cookie.  And so you use food to medicate pain, use medication pills to medicate pain.  Some of you, if somebody was in great pain, they would just do something that gave them instant gratification.  It did not matter if it violated their morals, all that they were telling you is the way out of pain is do something that gives instant gratification.  And that became a tool.  Or you might have had parents that if you were in great pain, they would try to make you happy by giving you a gift, buying you something, giving you extra attention for a day.  All of that was basically to say we are making you feel better, get over it.  So they are over compensating.  Some in your family, when they went through deep hurt or pain, they might have just let anger take over.  They lashed out.  They became full of resentment.  And for some, they began to entertain revenge plans, how they were going to hurt the other people back.  And that made them feel better for a little while.  And then you might have experienced a lot of clich√© type advice, trite advice that was hopefully going to make you instantly better.  So you might have been told quit being so negative, just be positive all the time.  Or if you came from a spiritual background, you might have heard Christians should always be joyful and victorious.  You are not being that way so you are not a good Christian.  Another common tool or approach to deep pain and hurt was, let's find a quick magical fix.  So you are in a lot of pain.  You are not getting over over it in a date.  We are going to take you to a counselor.  We are going to get you fixed or we are going to put you in a program.  And you better be fixed by the time you are done that program.  Or again, if you are in a spiritual background, you just need to have faith in God.  Or you just need this religious experience.  And that will just fix everything magically.  Many families were just put on a happy face.  Act like you are coping well.  Do not let others see that you are struggling.  So in public, always be happy.  That was their tool.  Some families basically gave the impression that everybody should deal with pain the same way, which meant you should deal with pain the way I, your parent, is dealing with pain.  And if you are not, you are not doing it right.  So if you are not using my tools, then you are doing it wrong.  Another one, some people developed was unhealthy self soothing.  Let's find ways to release opioids, so cutting.  Or let's find ways to just release dopamine.  So let's just sexually act out to make us feel better to get us out of this deep pain.  Some of you today, if you are deeply hurt by somebody, your tool that you use is to recruit others to take your side that you have been unjustly wrong and to fight for you against that person who hurt you.  It becomes a battle, a war.  Some of you growing up, the tool you developed to use to help you with your deep pain was to become a sadist.  You would hurt others.  And that would give you a release of your pain but a certain pleasure which would take you out of your pain.  Some of you engaged in risky behavior just to get the adrenaline going so you did not feel the pain as much.  Others of you, you only, you tried all those tools and the pain was still there.  And so you became more and more hopeless and you got to the point where you began to justify yourself.  There's no hope what's the point and suicide became your tool.  So 22 tools, how many of them did you grow up with and put in your toolbox?  So what I want you to see just big picture with this is when you get to deep hurt, deep loss, depression, those are three emotions you cannot resolve quickly.  And so there's not a quick fix for it.  There's three emotions that take a process that takes time for the brain to be able to accept and resolve those deep painful emotions.

But if you are growing up in complex trauma and you are not allowed that then you have to develop other ways to try to get out of it more quickly.  Now what happens for many people at this point is they go I do not ever want to get hurt again.  And so what they do is develop a new set of tools and I am going to give you 37 tools very quickly to make sure I never get hurt again.  So again you can check off the ones that you use that are true of you.  So the first one is I am going to become hard, jaded, cold.  I am not going to let anything affect me.  Or another way that takes shape is I am going to just shut down my conscience.  I do not care if I hurt people.  I do not care how people think about me.  I do not care if I break morals and do wrong things.  I am just going to harden my conscience.  Or another thing that comes out of that is I am just not going to care about anybody.  Because if you care about people that's when you get hurt.

But if I do not care about anybody then they cannot hurt me.  So some of you have gone to those three tools of hardening, of not caring.  Some of you have gone to the tool of well I will just stop having needs.  Because if I do not have needs then I do not need anybody and nobody can hurt me.  With that goes I will never be a burden.  If I have needs I will figure out how to handle them on my own.  So I never need anybody else.  Some of you have gone that road.  Some have gone you know what I need to be in a position of power.  So that I am over people.  And if I am in a position of power they cannot hurt me.  I can hurt them.  Some have thought you know what the way to get I never get hurt again.  It's just get everybody to like me.  So I will use humor so that everybody likes me.  And that was your tool.  Other said the way not to ever get hurt again or go through loss is to isolate.  Never have any relationships.  Disconnect from people and society.  Other said I am going to never get hurt again by remaining angry.  So that I am an intimidating force.  So everybody's afraid of me than nobody will hurt me.  So I will be intimidating or a bully.  I will hurt others before they hurt me.  Some the way to never get hurt but I want relationships.  So if I want relationships but I do not want to get hurt, never connect.  Never go deep.  Never let people truly get to know you.  Never be authentic again.  Just wear masks all the time.  Or others say I must always be in control.  Because if I am in control nobody can hurt me.  Or some say I can get hurt every time there's a change.  So I will avoid change, resist change.  Or every time I enter an unknown situation where I do not know what's going to happen, there's a chance I am going to get hurt.  So I will run from the unknown.  I just will stay in my own little bubble, my own little rot and avoid the unknown, avoid change.  Another one that people use is I will just become a people pleaser.  That way people will like me.  I will just do whatever they want, always serving, caring for people.  Some go even further.  If they have money, I will buy people's friendship.  I will be a gift giver where I am giving to people, gifts all the time just so they like me.  Some I will be a perfectionist.  If I do everything perfectly it reduces the chance of me getting hurt.  Or with that I will be an over achiever.  I will be the best at everything, the best employee at work.  That reduces my chance of getting hurt.  Or I will be super responsible.  I will make sure everything gets done even if it's not my responsibility.  That will reduce the chances of getting hurt.  Or some say screw being an over achiever, I am going to be an under achiever.  I am going to be irresponsible.  That way nobody expects anything of me.  That's my way of never getting hurt.  Or some go, the way to never get hurt is I got to drive myself because failure leads to hurt.  So I got to be very hard on myself.  That will help prevent me from getting hurt.  Or I need to be constantly vigilant, always looking for danger, negatives in people.  I need to focus on negative.  And then with that some go to, I am going to make a lot of assumptions about people and I am going to jump to worst case scenario.  That way they cannot hurt me.  Or some even go, if things are going good I am pretty sure the other shoe is going to drop.  So the way to get not hurt is to sabotage good things.  Some go, I am going to become super good at faking that I know what I am doing.  That way I will not get hurt.  Or I am going to become super good at blaming somebody or something for my problems.  That way it will deflect the attention from me to something else and that reduces the chances of getting hurt.  Some go, I want to find fault with normies or healthy people so that I feel better than them.  I can look down on them.  So I am going to say their life is boring.  I am going to say they are self-righteous.  I am going to find something that makes me justify putting distance from people.  That way I will not get hurt.  Some go beyond that I am going to find fault with everything.  That will give me an excuse to quit as soon as I think I might get hurt.  Or that will keep me constantly aware of danger, hypervigilant.  Or if I am finding fault with everything I never have to look at myself to see if maybe there's some issues with me.  I can keep distracted from my issues by finding fault with everybody.  Hopefully that will help me from getting hurt.  Another common tool to never get hurt again is never trust anyone ever again.  Or another one, play the victim.  Always walk around feeling sorry for yourself, complaining about things.  Poor me, learned helplessness.  That way others will come in feeling sorry for me and they will not hurt me.  They will fix my problems for me.  And I can just remain this helpless victim.  Or some go, you know what?  I am going to find a new family, a surrogate family, a community that has a lot of rules that I am good at keeping.  So I can jump through the hoops in that organization or that community better than anybody else.  So I will be looked up to as a model in that community.  That way I will not get hurt.  Or I am going to just create chaos everywhere and that will keep people feeling sorry for me, that how awful my life is.  Or that will keep people focused on all of the distractions I am creating and never really pay attention to me and my issues.  So I will not get criticized or hurt.  Some go, I just have to escape my emotional world.  So I am going to escape into my head and become a cerebral logical being that is a robot.  And then with that some go, I am just never going to feel so I am disconnecting from emotions.  I think emotions are bad.  Who needs emotions?  We just need to be logical in our head.  Others who do that then say in my head I need to overanalyze everything obsessively so I never get caught by surprise by anything so that I make sure I have seen everything from every angle.  That's the way to never get hurt.  Some go, I need to worry about everything.  Just play it over and over and over.  Every possible thing that could go wrong.  That will help me from getting hurt.  Or some say I need to become a professional gas lighter.  I need to be able to take everything people try to do to hurt me, twist it, distort it, and turn it back on them so it hurts them.  So all of those things, 37 tools, how did you do?  What I want you to see is this.  I hope you could see that all of those tools look like they were going to prevent you from getting hurt again, but do you realize that in the long run they ended up in even more pain?  You got hurt even worse, you hurt yourself, you got into relationships where eventually you got hurt even worse.  So those tools seem to work in the short term, but in the long term they just make things worse.  Now I want to add a third thing here that can happen when people go through deep hurt, deep loss, they can actually begin to use that pain as a tool.  So if they talk about their deep hurt and deep loss, boy it gets me a lot of attention.  It gets me a lot of empathy.  Respect, I play this martyr that everything's out to get me.  Life is so hard, I have gone through so much and people look up to me and it gets me respect.  Some go, you know what, if I use to play this card of my pain, now I can walk around and be entitled because now the world owes me, because it's dealt me such a crappy hand, it owes me stuff.  Now I can demand to be treated with all this extra stuff so I do not have to work.  I do not have to work hard like others.  I can just sit back and they will give it to me because they owe it to me.  Or I can use all this pain as a way to manipulate people to get them to do what I want.  And I can become irresponsible in doing that.  Or I can feel superior to others because my pain's greater than yours.  So I am greater than you that I have gone through this pain.  So all of those things can come out of deep pain as well.  Okay, so let's go to the uncomfortable emotions and go through this quickly because what you are going to see is uncomfortable emotions triggers the deep pain fear.  And so you use very similar tools to what you developed earlier in life for handling deep pain and loss.  Most of these tools just kick in the gear subconsciously, you do not even think about it.  So let me very quickly go through 27 tools that you might use when you are feeling uncomfortable.  So number one, disconnect from your emotions.  I do not want to feel.  Isolate with draw into yourself.  Stop being present to other people.  Medicaid through eating, sleeping, drugs, medication, unhealthy soothing behaviors, self-harm, escape through fantasy, through TV.  Get a whole bunch of distractions and stay busy so that you do not feel.  Use it to become super needy.  Turn it into anger because anger, if you feel anger, you do not feel the other uncomfortable emotions.  Do something that gives you impulsive instant gratification.  Or just quit because you are pretty sure something bad is going to happen.  Play the victim right away.  Go to that learned helplessness stuff.  Blame others for how you are feeling.  Make excuses when you start to act out.  Make excuses for your behavior.  Become very negative and critical about others in your circumstances.  Engage in risky behavior.  Create drama and chaos to distract.  Become more demanding of others.  Obsessively overanalyze.  Obsessively worry.  Procrastinate.  Keep putting things off.  Overtalk your problems to everybody.  So you are constantly venting, poor me, poor me.  This is what is happening.  Seek out a quick fix from a counselor.  Focus on the symptoms and fixing the symptoms, but never ask what the underlying causes of those symptoms are.  Complain about your problems to everybody, but do not change anything.  Go on the war path and attack who you think is responsible for your discomfort, but never look at what your part might be.  And then try to force others to change, to suit you thinking that if they change, then your discomfort will go away, but never look at what your part might be.  So again, how's your toolbox?  How many of those are in that toolbox?  Some of you might begin to go, wow, I have a big toolbox and it has a lot of unhealthy tools.  So let me come to the third area where we need tools and that's getting our needs met.  And again, it's going to be very similar to the other tools.  So I am going to go through it quickly, but number one, use manipulation to get my needs met.  So use anger, intimidation, guilt, people, shame people, use tears, nag, groomed people with gifts, also that they will meet my needs, control people, wear masks, people please, if they, if I please them, maybe they will please me.  Be a perfectionist.  That way people will want to help me become a codependent in a relationship, I meet your need if you meet my need, help others.  That will hopefully get me respect, that will hopefully fix some of my shame, or become lying, be sneaky, operate by it's easier to say you are sorry than to ask for permission.  Or do whatever is necessary to get people to validate you, does not matter what your morals are, so sleep with them, focus on all the wrong things just to get them to validate you.  Some go to, let's just settle for getting my needs partially met with an unhealthy tool.  So I do not want true connection because that requires authenticity.  So let's try to get connection through promiscuity, through humor, through just bar room type conversation fun.  So you are trying to meet a need with a tool that is not the right tool, it's an unhealthy tool, or try to get your need met with the wrong thing.  So you are emotionally stressed out so let's just eat food, or let's have sex instead of true connection.  So you are trying to meet your needs with the wrong thing.  So those are the tools that most use when it comes to trying to get their needs met.  So that is a big toolbox of unhealthy tools.  I am not sure how you did, some of you are probably feeling a bit overwhelmed as you realize how many of the tools that you have used in your life are not healthy.

But that leads to, okay, what do I do about it?  So what I want you to understand is that the whole focus of dealing with complex PTSD or complex trauma is first of all to help people understand their unhealthy tools, then to help them realize that those tools might have helped you survive but they do not create a healthy life.  They might give you short term what it looks like it's doing the job, but in long term it always makes things worse.  So that leads to three things.  The first is they must come to a point where they say, you know what?  It is now time to retire this tool.  I am no longer going to justify manipulating people.  I am no longer going to try to justify being a control freak.  It is time to give that up and put it in the garbage.  Now that is a very important decision and it's not as easy to do as you might think because when you use that tool for so many years, that's the first place your brain wants to go and often when you are feeling uncomfortable emotions, your in your limbic brain and your limbic brain is wanting a tool not that gives long-term health but gives instant fix or gratification.  So it wants to go back to that tool even though you know it's not healthy but you need to start by saying I am done with that tool.  Then you have to go to, okay, I grew up with all these wrong tools but that also meant I grew up with a lot of unhealthy as my normal.  So I know what unhealthy looks like but what does healthy look like?  So you begin to understand what does a healthy relationship look like?  What does a healthy taking care of myself and meeting my needs look like?  What does healthy love look like?  Healthy boundaries look like?  And then you go to the third, what tools do I need to begin to use to get to that healthy life?  To become healthy in my own life so that you begin to amass a new toolbox.  Now let me just end by saying this.  You do not get a new toolbox in one week or two weeks or a month.  Getting new healthy tools is a gradual learning process.  It is something you have to be patient with.  You learn healthy tools first of all academically.  You get it, explain to you, describe to you.

But then as you try to apply it, then you learn more.  And you realize, okay, what I heard in that explanation, now I have to qualify.  Now I have to adjust for this situation and you begin to get a clearer picture of what that healthy tool looks like.  So I hope this just gives you a little bit of insight.  Okay, that's the end of part one.  We are going to take a short break and then I am going to come back for the Christian part and that is very much an optional part.  If that does not interest you, no problem.  You are free to go, no offense taken.  For everybody else who's going to stay, I will be back in just a minute.  Well, welcome back.  We have been following the life of Joseph a character in the first part of the Bible in the book of Genesis.  And we just left him where Pharaoh had a dream.  And Joseph has been asked to come and interpret that dream.  And he told Pharaoh that the dream meant that Egypt was going to have seven years of plenty, bountiful crops, followed by seven years of famine.  And then he suggested to Pharaoh that during the seven years of plenty, they taxed farmers 20% of their grain, put it in great big silos so that when the seven years of famine hit, they have enough grain to feed all of Egypt.  And Pharaoh has thought that is such a brilliant idea.  I want you to be the man to organize all of that.  So Joseph was taken out of prison and promoted to being second in command in the land of Egypt.  So that's where I want to pick up today.  So we gone through the seven years of bounty.  So Joseph, remember at 17 is when the first trauma happened and he had 13 years of trauma.  Then he interpreted the dream at age 30, then seven years of plenty.  So 37, that's how old he is now.  So when this, at last the seven years of bumper crops, throughout the land of Egypt, came to an end.  Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted.  With severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians.  And people from all around, not just Egyptians but all around Egypt, came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe, not just throughout Egypt but throughout the world.  When Jacob, that's Joseph's father who's up in Israel, when Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt, he said to his sons, and he's got 11 other sons, why are you standing around looking at one another?  I have heard there's grain in Egypt, go down and buy enough grain to keep us alive, otherwise we will die.  So Joseph's 10 older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.  Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came.  Now remember, he's 37.  The last time they saw him was a boy of 17.  Now he is dressed in the regalia of Egyptian high command, so when they arrive, they do not recognize him.  They bow down before him with their faces to the ground.  Joseph recognizes brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger.

But what just happened?  Joseph's dream was fulfilled, that his brothers would bow before him.  Now I want to give you a big picture of this story.  After Joseph finally gets to the point where he feels comfortable revealing his identity to his brothers, they are afraid, because they are afraid now he's going to take revenge on us, but he said, says this to them in Genesis 50, you intended to harm me, but God intended it for good to accomplish what is now being done, the saving of many lives.  What I want you to see is Joseph now looks back over the last 20 years of his life and he says, you were trying to harm me, but now I see that God was using all of that bad stuff for good to prepare me for this present job of saving the world.  His whole perspective on his trauma has changed from it being a totally negative thing to it being a tool that when he cooperated with God, it was used to prepare him for great service.  So let me give you the big picture of that.  God made a promise to Abraham years earlier that the Messiah would come from them, from him, from the Jewish nation, and so that means the Jewish nation has to be kept alive until the Messiah comes.  And so there's a famine going to hit the world.  God's got to keep the Jewish nation alive, so how's he going to do that?  So what we are going to see is that there's going to be thousands and thousands of human decisions made.  In fact, it's going to seem like God is not involved at all.  He's not interfering with anything, but somehow through all of these human decisions, many of them are tragic, cruel, wrong, somehow Israel gets saved.  It's the weirdest thing and you go, is it odd or is it God?  What's happening here?  So here's number one, the famine.  Egypt is the only country in the world with food.  So if Israel's going to be saved, they have to go to Egypt to get food, but there's a problem.  Egyptians hated shepherds.  And Israel was made up of shepherds.  So if they are going to get a warm reception in Egypt, somehow somebody has to get up in Egyptian government who has a sympathy or warmth of feeling towards Jewish shepherds.  Well, that's the second problem.  The Egyptian government was ruled by dynasties that did not allow outsiders to infiltrate the government.  So how would they get somebody who's a Jewish sympathizer into government when it's a very closed dynasty that hates Jewish shepherds?  Well, it's an interesting that just 50 to 100 years earlier there was an overthrow of the Egyptian dynasty.  And the new dynasty was made up of people sympathetic to shepherds.  Okay, so now the right potential government is there.  How can we get a person there into the government?  Well, let's get Joseph there.  Well, how are we going to get Joseph into the Egyptian government?  He's up in Israel.  Well, so what happens?  Brothers hate him.  Brothers harshly treat him, bully him.  Brothers debate whether to kill or to sell him.  And just at that moment some Midianite traders pass by on their way to Egypt and they decide to sell Joseph to those Midianite traders.  And it just so happens when he gets to Egypt that pot of her buys him as a slave and pot of her is the bodyguard for Pharaoh.  He's high up in government and he likes Joseph and he gives him administrative responsibility.  He puts them over other slaves and Joseph begins to learn about administration.  He begins to learn about dealing with difficult people who are not happy.  He begins to learn about how Egyptian government works.  And then pot of her wife wants him to have sex with her and he refuses so he accuses him of rape and he gets put unjustly into prison.  It looks like a disaster, but the prison warden likes him and gives him responsibility.  So he learns more administration skills.  Now he has to deal with more difficult people.  Prisoners do not tend to be happy people.  And then two prisoners come, the cup bearer and baker, Pharaoh's food testers, people that Pharaoh trusts with his life very close to Pharaoh.  And Joseph is given responsibility to take care of them.  He gets to know them.  He learns more about the government, more about Pharaoh.  And then Pharaoh has a dream.  And the cup bearer says I remember this guy in prison who could interpret dreams.  And Joseph is brought into interpret Pharaoh's dream and he interprets it.  And it happens exactly as Joseph says and Pharaoh makes him his right hand man.  Joseph is now in the position, high up in the government so that when his brothers come for grain, there's somebody sympathetic to them in government who will then invite them to move to Egypt for the rest of the famine.

But he's been getting training in how the Egyptian government works.  He's been getting training in administration.  He's been getting training in dealing with difficult people and growing up as a spoiled child, the favorite child.  He knows now that he's the favorite child in Egypt again.  He knows what not to do this time.  He knows to not let it go to his head.  Is not that amazing?  Thousands of decisions have been made.  It looks like God is totally absent.

But the right events have eventually happened so that the nation of Israel is spared from famine.  So let me end with Genesis 50 again.  My hope for every person who's gone through trauma is that someday you would be able to look at the people who created that trauma for you and say, you intended that to harm me.

But God has intended that for good.  God wanted me to cooperate with him and heal and learn lessons from that trauma and gain wisdom from that trauma and skill sets from that trauma so that I would become a better person with a greater reach of how I can help others.  What you intended as harm, God turned into a positive.  That is what I have seen happen in the lives of many people who have been traumatized.  They have been able to come to that point.  I hope Joseph's story will help you see that it's possible.  We can explain how God works in those situations.  It's beyond our ability to fully understand it.

But we do see pattern after pattern that God takes what was intended to hurt and somehow turns it into good.  Let's pray.  Father, thank you for the example of Joseph's story and just your amazing providence to somehow be involved in ways we do not even understand to turn the negative into good.  And I pray that you would just encourage people and help them to trust you with their pain and with the healing process.  Amen.  Well, that's the end of our evening.  Thank you so much for being part of it.  Hope you have a great weekend.  We will see you next time.
