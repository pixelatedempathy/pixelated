    bio: 'For over 15 years, Chad has been a self-taught programmer, developing deep expertise in Python, TypeScript, and Rust, contributing to numerous open-source projects. Currently pursuing a counseling degree, he identified a critical gap in traditional therapy training: the lack of safe, repeatable practice opportunities for aspiring therapists.

          Our Mission
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
          Pixelated Empathy is dedicated to revolutionizing mental health
          training. We provide therapists, counselors, and students with a safe,
          AI-powered platform to practice and master their skills. By simulating
          a diverse range of client personas and challenging scenarios, we
          empower mental health professionals to build confidence, identify and
          overcome biases, and ultimately deliver more effective and empathetic
          care.

            The Problem We Solve
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            Traditional therapist training often lacks sufficient opportunities
            for realistic, hands-on practice, especially with high-stakes
            scenarios like crisis intervention or with diverse client
            populations. This can lead to gaps in preparedness, confidence, and
            cultural competency. Pixelated Empathy bridges this gap by providing
            a standardized, on-demand training environment that is both safe and
            effective.
