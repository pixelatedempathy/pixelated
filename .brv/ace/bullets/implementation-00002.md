Task Group 2 (Source Discovery Engine) fully implemented: Created PubMed Central E-utilities client with MeSH term support, DOAJ journal search client, repository clients for Dryad/Zenodo/ClinicalTrials.gov, metadata parser for different formats, deduplication logic (DOI and similarity-based), and unified DiscoveryService implementing DiscoveryServiceProtocol. All components integrated into CLI and main.py. Discovery module now complete and functional.
