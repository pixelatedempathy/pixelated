# Minimal requirements for Cloudflare Pages builds
# This file prevents Cloudflare Pages from installing heavy ML dependencies
# from pyproject.toml, which would exceed build time limits.
#
# For local development and other deployments, use pyproject.toml with:
#   uv install  # or pip install -e .

# No dependencies needed for frontend-only Cloudflare Pages builds
# Python dependencies are only needed for backend services, not the frontend build
