# Framework 3: Voss (Tactical Empathy & Hidden Needs)

## Stated vs Real Needs

**Surface Statements** (What they say):
- Official requirements
- Formal objections
- Stated concerns

**Hidden Needs** (What they really want):
- Emotional safety
- Status/recognition
- Risk mitigation
- Political cover

## Tactical Empathy Techniques

1. **Labeling**: Name their emotions to defuse them
   - "It seems like you're concerned about..."
   - "It sounds like the real issue is..."

2. **Calibrated Questions**: Open-ended "how" and "what" questions
   - "What concerns you most about this?"
   - "How would you like this to work?"

3. **Black Swans**: Unknown unknowns that change everything
   - Hidden stakeholders with veto power
   - Unstated past traumas/failures
   - Personal career concerns

## Output Template

```yaml
Surface Needs (Stated):
  - "We need better security"
  - "ROI must be clear"
  - "Compliance requirements"

Real Needs (Hidden):
  - Safety: "I won't get blamed if this fails" (90%)
  - Status: "I'll look competent to CEO" (70%)
  - Control: "I maintain authority" (85%)

Tactical Empathy Phrases:
  - Labeling: "It seems like ensuring nothing goes wrong is the top priority..."
  - Calibrated: "What would need to happen for you to feel confident about this?"

Black Swan Risks:
  - CEO has cloud skepticism from prior bad experience
  - Board member has competing vendor relationship
  - Upcoming audit makes any change risky
```
