## Phase 08 — Monitoring, Observability & Ops

Summary
-------
Phase 08 provides full-stack monitoring and observability: metrics, tracing, logging, dashboards, SLOs, alerting, and automated remediation where possible. This is required to operate at scale safely.

Primary goal
- Provide a single observability surface that covers ingestion → pipeline → training → serving with clear SLOs and alerting.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Define SLOs and SLIs for each stage (ingest latency, pipeline throughput, model latency, accuracy drift)
- [ ] Instrument all services with structured metrics and tracing (Prometheus + OpenTelemetry)
- [ ] Create dashboards for operations and health (Grafana or equivalent)
- [ ] Add alerting for critical thresholds and pager runbooks
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection for model drift and data distribution shift
- [ ] Implement log aggregation and retention policies (with PII redaction)
- [ ] Add synthetic monitoring and end-to-end smoke runs on schedule
- [ ] Add automated remediation playbooks for common failures (retry, circuit-breaker, fallback models)
- [ ] Provide cost and resource monitoring for training/inference runs
- [ ] Document monitoring architecture and emergency runbooks in `docs/ops/monitoring.md`
- [ ] Ensure compliance logs and audit trails for regulated datasets and HIPAA-sensitive flows
