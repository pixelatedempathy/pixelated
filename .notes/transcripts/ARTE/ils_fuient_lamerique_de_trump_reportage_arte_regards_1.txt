OK. So just wait here. The taxi. This is the fucking taxi. It's over there. Chris Kelly and his daughter Teresa have just landed in Barcelona, from California. Seven bags. Seven, eight, nine. Ten, eleven, ten. My whole life. I'm nervous about school. I'm nervous about like, coming here to Spain and not knowing a bunch of Spanish. Go ahead. You're going to go with the cab. Gracias. Where are you from? San Diego. Maybe there's someone here from Canada. Because of the current political situation. Everyone's worried about what's happening in the United States. Judging what's going on in America right now. He's eating what? He said the food is so good. Oh. So good. , he's just a big king. Means where are you seeing where you are. No. Oh, because it's got. Yeah. Then Zap. Cristo. P fuel. Hey? You think this? welcome home I love my god in 2016 during the first mandate of donald trump I said I want to leave but I was not able to do it financially me as a single mother my greatest concern is the good education and safety of my daughter this time while the elections are approaching my daughter and I have discussed what we were going to do if he won if he was no longer in phase with this new america chris and teresa therefore make the choice of leaving very far from california they called on barbara a french specialist in expatriation in barcelona it is she who found these three pieces in the center of life I won the big lot with barbara I could never have done it all alone where is the light oh it's so cute this room it's the first time she has her own room this is my bathroom and mine where is it over there in san diego chris was the owner of a beauty salon a single mother of the middle class confronted with inflation and the housing crisis it was impossible for him to offer his home to her children and to her children and to her children he was the only one who could afford to rent his own room to his daughter we had a foldable bed in the living room in order to rent something like that in the united states it would cost me 3500 see 4000 dollars in barcelona his rent is 2000 euros per month thanks to his savings and his pension chris hopes to improve his purchasing power compared to the united states a loaf of bread cost me six dollars i'm not even talking about meat or other more expensive products it's a simple piece of bread the same for the housing price trump had promised his voters to take care of it that everything would go down but now that he is in power he does the opposite and it doesn't bother him to take people for idiots because they are idiots who put him in power in the first place so now before the sun is completely gone come and see before the sun is completely gone come and see before the sun is completely gone the terrace the terrace and the family sacred and the family sacred and the family sacred okay wait wait wait concretely i would say that i have two or three times more americans who ask me today than before since the election of donald trump especially in relation to how he conceives the rights of man and the way he wants to live today the united states is not for them the united states is not for themバイ since november 5, 1231 the day of the elections of donald trump the american society never seemed that tightly because you direct consequences the questions related to expatriation to expatriation happened must 15s race 16 the people who left the country went from 15,000 to 24,000. Their number tripled in Portugal, 15,000 people today, and Spanish visa applications increased by 70% in 9 years. With 41,000 permanent American residents, Spain has become a privileged home, not only by elites or students. Today, it is also families of the middle class, single mothers, and university students who settle in the country. But are all these Americans really welcome in Spain? For the moment, these new arrivals are not asking themselves the question. Here, people, they live, their priorities are their life, what they enjoy doing, their families, their friends, and it's not all just about work, which I think, you know, you have to have a reputation, right? We're very much a work culture, but here, it's just that, though. At 45, Sipit Abibian is part of the American diaspora in Spain. It's been 10 years that she lives in this country, today in Malaga. How are you, my darlings? You look happy to see me. This is not what I expected when I came to settle in Spain. I just feel so lucky. This is my vision. Look at my view, the Mediterranean Sea. I grew up in the suburbs, a typical American neighborhood, and pretty is not the word that I would associate with the environment in which I grew up. It's very different from home. In Austin, Texas, Sipi worked in human resources. Today, far from office life, she has become an influencer and an expatriate coach. This is a far-reaching vision. Okay. There's no too much sunlight. Let's see. Want the latest news about visa movements abroad? Well, stay tuned. Follow me for more tips and tricks. This is my next video for this year. There's a TikTok, Instagram and YouTube video, and a lot of people find me, though. Since the election of Donald Trump, these videos to leave Europe are being watched more and more. On Twitter, it's been written, networks it is followed by more than 65,000 subscribers among the 19 European countries that cipi advises spain is the most wanted country spain has many visas and there are for all tastes like the visa for Spanish digital nomads the visa for retirees or student visa ok that's good once confidential these online master classes are now going to be 100 dollars for four days of intensive coaching and study all the options to emigrate to europe before in my master classes I had 90 to 100 people but for the ones I organized a week after the elections of trump I was completely shocked there were 664 registered I am not naive I was doubting that if trump won it would decide people to go abroad but I had not imagined such a level the first idea of ​​cippi was to share his own experience that of a woman who is addressing other women when I moved to madrid I met so many women who had left the united states too and I thought it would be cool that those who are already here can help those who want to come but I did not start this project with any militant or political preoccupation it was not even a topic of conversation like every week she also has an online meeting with those who are about to change their lives let's go we let everyone in hello ladies welcome welcome hello hi everyone it's nice to see your faces let's take a little tour of the table does anyone want to share something good news to tell everybody at this point what do you have to tell me the Name of the people ofъ it's always fun to go out and let them know that it's interesting so it is a good place see how it works so if we don't have any contact people here now it's really unfortunate but we did it happily really new one! and related in places all around the world eu Old F當然 ركبت disregards we started it up with people from north africa from the east africa from the north africa traters venezuela� and missy Bernhardt community there is something to promise that this country can't hide a real distress those of people confronted with an america they no longer recognize I live in florida which is one of the most republican states and here everything looks like a meeting for trumpists I can't go anywhere without meeting them and it's just a lot of hate speech a lot of anger blame immigration blame the corrupt judges I try not to be emotional but it's absolutely terrifying I think about it all the time I no longer feel at peace in this country and I'm not just talking about my mental health I also feel physically at risk I work at the university for diversity equity and inclusion there is about a month my university decided to cancel its programs on diversity which is really overwhelming I mean to see all your life your work swept away you wonder how long you can stand it without leaving your health and it's time to preserve myself and change my life thank you so much for sharing it pains me to hear you know I'm really sorry that I can't hear you so I'm sorry to hear you not please don't be회 you've been threaten And if you want to tell us that I wonder what I can do when we see your face you know more on things on life you'll need the rest of the day and we I don't care about if we're people or if we're under everyone else if we decide to become part of the community it's just about和 are who are working for our country I think about it all the time you what do you mean with space the way people think about that is small it is really Wahn more it's really about stop being steep with your safety safety and I think so much about where our right are going with what we're doing right now It's really about be a person to sit down and speaking to your mind and how important part of the our nature is I wish that the election results would be different and that my business would be boosted for other reasons. While I live here my best life, it is not only the people with whom I work, my clients, but also my family and my friends who live in the United States, who must compose with this new America. Ciao! Thank you! Bye! Bye! Like 15,000 other Americans, Vanessa Velasquez chose Madrid. Vanessa is a lesbian, she lived in Republican land in Texas. Her sexual identity is at the heart of her decision-making. Being gay in Texas was already in Paris. And I think the rise in trans people, and the rise in the American community, and the rise in the anti-trans and homophobic violence in the election, because a lot of people felt even more disinhibited. And I'm having to leave them because there's this institution that could be coming after my rights. What have I already put in the dry? After two months of stay in Madrid, she only comes to move in this 15 square meters. It is actually a studio, a granite studio. I live in a granite. This is going to be my living room. And then I have this... And here is this pile of things that I have to manage. I had to take everything with me, so I needed to put a little bit of time. So I just took what was important to me, essentially. So I felt a lot of sadness, not because of abandoned objects, but especially to leave this country where I have so many memories. I have been my entire life. Vanessa is from a Colombian family. When I make Colombian cuisine, like suda de pollo and stuff, I have to put in salsa to call my ancestors. My previous ancestors. They tell me how to dose the ingredients. And if I don't have music, it's inedible. I make a terrible dish. For her, speaking Spanish was essential in choosing her home. When I was little, we spoke Spanish at home. And I had a duty to continue studying at university. Studying Spanish? So, this is like a standard breakfast in Colombia. Everybody makes it. Maybe that's because for breakfast, that's for dinner. I guess I probably should get a table set. Vanessa's parents came to the United States in the 70's. I asked my mom for this picture. This was the picture that was on my nightstand. This is my dad. This is my dad. Her father, who passed away today, had crossed the border illegally on foot in search of the American dream. 50 years later, Vanessa is moving to another continent. She has her American passport in her pocket. She is aware of her privileges. It's crazy to think about now. Because we don't have a phone. He didn't have a phone. He didn't have the resources. He didn't have access to all the facilities I have access to. So, that reminds me that no matter how hard it is emotionally, physically, mentally, or psychologically to be making this move, is to continue persevering. Come on. I did not know I had this. I was so blonde. It was mind-blowing. But yeah, I think it's ironic. I got it. My parents immigrated to the United States to have a better life. And I am here in Europe to have a better life. And I am here to have a better life. In her family, Vanessa is one of the only to have voted Democrat. Hi! How are you? Hello, how are you, mom? You saw my pilot, Lisa. Yeah, I saw that. Well, so, I'm not a full-time Latino American. I live here. But I have a position of anti-immigration. We didn't get any... We didn't get any... And it's just, we worked very hard to get here. We are... But you have people who come here to try to get everything for free. And trying to get everything for free. And they don't want to work. And that's why a lot of people say, enough. It's just, you know, you don't know what's going to be done. It's kind of all... Yeah, mom. It's shit. A little bit. All right. Love you. Thanks, mom. Bye, mom. I love you. See you later. Okay, bye. It's always kind of weird. We have different views, but... She's... It's always kind of uncomfortable to talk politics. My mom and I have been pretty well. So, yeah, it's always a very tricky subject, with many members of my family. I'm always with many members of my family. And they don't get it, and they don't get it. And they don't get it. And they don't get it. And they don't get it. uncles and aunts who openly held homophobic and racist words when leaving in spain vanessa cut the<|fr|> family group where there are 30 40 people it's crazy but I left this group because some things were said and I thought it was no longer possible and I felt more and more alone within my family I think he loved me maybe he loved me even more but as long as I don't say I'm gay I didn't choose to be gay I didn't choose to be a woman I'm like that that's all Procurement Procurement Procurement Procurement but even at 10,000 km from her home his spirit is still in the United States in addition to teresa she is the mother of two other children aged more than 30 years old and alive in siate yes I am really worried for them even if they are adults they are my children being here I can take distance from what is happening there but at the same time it is so much what I am living here but at the same time it is so much what I am living here it is so much what I am living here that I can't help but watch the news it's almost a movie what will be the next rebound teresa got a visa for spain quickly because she comes to continue her studies this morning she has to visit her new high school you get on the bus and you put it in the machine I think there are about ten trips the 17-year-old teenager never took public transport alone in san diego it is her mother who in the morning and evening drove her to the high school tomorrow I will let her get on the bus alone for the very first time to go to school it's a little scary it's not something I was considering in the United States I think it's here in this international school the courses are practiced in Spanish and English and welcome to barcelona thank you I am so happy follow me and the local on the 340 students of the establishment 60 are of American nationality I start Monday at 11 o'clock stress and no it's okay I'm not stressed teresa is impatient to discover her new class far from the violence that has ruined her last years of schooling in san diego in the united states schools are closed the hats eight last night those are on their results you know is at america and порo at 캐�ila we have the Wi-Fi which means it is implanted you will differently the US Gwen and you look at the question and similar To tell me that I can send my daughter to school, that she never goes home. You know, there is a reason why the doors are not locked at home, why there are no armed policemen, it's because we don't need it here. And I know it's hard for you to understand at first, but soon you will realize that all this was not normal. By making the choice of exile, many American parents also seek to escape a school system in the direction of the Trump administration. Yes, we have a lot of families that were September, and a lot of them contacted me just after the election of Trump, when he was re-elected, to ask me if he could come earlier. I would say that there is an increase of about 40% of the number of families who try to come from the United States. But we are not able to welcome everyone. Do you find yourself lucky? Yes, of course. The streets are so different from San Diego. Yeah, they are so much wider. When she walks around town, mother and daughter enjoy a simple pleasure, flung in the streets of Barcelona. Come on, let me take a picture of you. It's the Arc de Triomphe, but I don't know why he is here and not in Paris. It's like the weight is lifted off my shoulders. It will allow me to... Step by step. Step by step. Step by step. Step by step. Step by step. Day by day, to get out of this nightmare in which my country is sinking. In Malaga, Sipi has never been so overflowing. When was the last time he was like this? Like this? Yes, here. Oh my God, a long time. Really, it didn't stop. I live here, but I was in France at that time. In France. On Spanish TV, I saw that he had been gone for about 20 days. These last months, the business chief spends her life in planes. And this weekend, it's in Madrid that she meets. See you. Hi, friends. Hey, happy to see you. It's so beautiful. You have chosen a great neighborhood. Next door, there is another great one. Hélène and Lee are a couple from New York. If they meet Sipi today, it is to benefit from his advice on the Madrid life. This place is really cute if you want to have a glass of wine. Vinicola. There, in this street, there is a bar. There, in this street, there is a bar. It's like a full-time restaurant. International food stores. Okay, so you guys have to pay for furniture for your apartment? Well, that's kind of exciting. Yeah, it's part of the steps when we move to the other side of the world. Yeah. So we're coming to the point where it all started. Thank you. Oh yeah, right. This street, this neighborhood, is really a part of everything for me. It's really special for me. I had my first apartment when I arrived in Madrid ten years later if he still says he is passionate about his work but mentally exhausted by the situation in the United States sometimes I just want to focus on the positive I don't even want to talk politics even with people who agree with me it's just depressing the idea of ​​the American dream is a democratic America is sinking and seeing everything change so quickly it's so sad it's difficult to digest in real time so yes it's really shocking to see the speed at which things are changing I think we moved at the right time there is no reason that I return to live in the United States for that I always feel very American whether it be my business spirit or my optimism my smile you know how we are the moments that coach prefers is when she finally meets in real life the women she accompanied online it's open bar take a drink that evening they are 25 to have answered the invitation I really want to cry you are so small everyone tells me I thought you were taller after months of support casey forbes leaves florida she also chose madrid for a new year's party in the United States not so slowly like the second coincidence has allowed me to spiders and light travel 24 hours you posted on facebook at to you had almost certain time to participate迎 Sipi is here, the one who connects us all.

And tonight is a very special event where we celebrate both the journey traveled by my community and the journey you have made since you started. These events, like the one tonight, are part of my after-sales service. But they are like the after-sales service, because after you've achieved a goal in life, this is kind of like the celebratory carding ass. I'm going to be a part of it. I'm going to be a part of it. I'm going to be a part of it. From the side of Barcelona, Chris set himself the goal of learning Spanish as quickly as possible, with the help of Teresa. Three months after her arrival, Vanessa continues her discovery of Madrid alongside new friends. Next spring, she will resume her studies in psychology. In two years, and thanks to her Colombian origins, she will be able to ask for Spanish nationality. This year, Vanessaelling has a one year scholarship toCI and can cripple a person's diabetes dependent specialist på integration with foreign health here at Smooth Services in stores.
