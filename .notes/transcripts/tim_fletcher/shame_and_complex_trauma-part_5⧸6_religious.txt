Every thought is negative.

But what I want you to understand is it only makes the shame worse.

It doesn't make it better.

So the solution that the brain has that I need to beat myself up, that I need to be hard on myself, I need to put myself in the doghouse because bad people need punishment, that's my justice system, that does not resolve it.

It only makes the shame worse.

So you need to understand that.

Now very quickly, what emotions do you go to besides the shame?

So we said that shame technically is a belief.

It's not first an emotion, but we do have what we call a shame emotion where I have a feeling of not being good enough.

With that usually comes anger at myself.

So shame turns into anger at myself and then often at the world and I just become more irritable.

For others, shame causes greater anxiety.

So now I'm going around, what do people think of me?

Do they think I'm stupid?

Is everybody looking at me differently?

Am I pretty enough?

Am I smart enough?

And insecurity after insecurity.

And then when you go to be in a social setting, you get anxiety comes up, all because of shame.

Some go to depression and they just get really down.

Others go to guilt and others go to hopelessness.

Do you see that?

All negative emotions.

So shame has brought negative thoughts, negative emotions, and those start to feed each other and not in a good way.

Some go to self-hatred.

Some go to self-pity.

And it's just poor me and let's have a pity party for a while.

And then they go to the actions.

How does that affect your behaviour?

So you might be starting to see some of your patterns.

Patterns in your thinking, patterns in your emotions.

It's the patterns in your actions that are also very important.

Some begin to isolate.

I can't face people now.

I'm sure they all think I'm terrible.

So you avoid people and you avoid the things that you're doing.

And you avoid the things that you're doing.

You avoid people.

You avoid social activities.

You isolate.

Do you want to know what isolation does to shame?

It feeds it.

Because now you only have your own thoughts to live with and your own self-hatred to live with.

Some become very negative.

When they're in shame mode, they become negative about everything.

Nothing is good enough.

They are critical.

They focus on the negative.

They lose all objectivity.

And everything gets distorted in a negative way.

Some go to childhood ways of dealing with shame.

They might eat their feelings away.

They might self-harm.

They might sleep, whatever.

They can do all those kind of things.

Some immediately start putting masks back on.

I can't let people see this.

So let's be happy all the time.

Let's be super competent.

Let's be a people pleaser.

Let's change how people think of me.

That doesn't work, but some do it.

Many go, it doesn't bother me, even though it does.

Some go to self-harm.

And they can sabotage good things in their life once their shame is triggered.

So they start beating themselves up, and then they go, I don't deserve a good job, a good relationship.

I don't deserve a good life.

Let's sabotage everything.

Others want to lash out not just at themselves, but anybody close.

And so when you're in shame mode, you usually hurt those closest to you.

And you want to know what happens afterwards?

That makes your shame and your guilt even worse.

Some become busy with distractions.

I don't want to feel.

I just want to do.

Some medicate, and shopping therapy is what some go to.

When they're feeling shame, others start risk-taking behaviors.

So let's do something that flirts with destruction and see if it happens.

Some, when they're in shame, can become very impulsive and make rash decisions.

Some relapse.

And what I said at the very beginning is this.

I've never seen anybody stay clean and sober if they don't deal with shame.

Because shame will ultimately, over a period of years, train you that the only way to deal with your shame is to drink or use and numb it out.

So if you think of your drinking and using, for many of you, it was a solution to shame.

You didn't feel like you belonged, so you drank, and you felt like you were part of the group.

You felt socially awkward and shy, so you drank, to be the life of the party.

You were trying to solve your shame with drugs and alcohol.

And your brain will still want to go back there today.

And that's important to be aware of.

So, self-awareness.

So you can take that home.

You can kind of map out your main shame triggers.

And then you can see what you do in your thinking, emotions, and actions once your shame is triggered.

And I don't give you this just so you can say, okay, now I know all of this about myself.

No, I tell you this so that now, once your shame is triggered, and all of a sudden you realize you're getting down on yourself, and you're starting to beat yourself up, you can go, stop that.

And you can catch yourself before it progresses.

Or you feel yourself saying, I can't face people, I'm going to isolate.

You go, no, I'm going to force myself to go with friends that I know are safe, and I'm not going to give in to this shame impulse.

So this self-awareness is so you can catch yourself before your shame gets too bad, and then it leads to a relapse.

So that might not have felt like a pick-me-up, let's heal from shame solution.

Next week's the pick-me-up.

This week is, shame is becoming aware of shame.

Healing from shame is becoming aware of shame so I can stop my shame patterns.

So for the Christian, I was thinking along this shame thing in light of the Bible, and I'm thinking one of the dangers I think that people have as they begin dealing with their shame is they, without realizing it, still bring some of their old thinking into it.

So here's how the thinking goes.

I feel useless, I feel less than, not good enough, inferior.

So what I should have happened once I start feeling good about myself is that then I should have a job that's a big job.

Because if I'm a nothing person, then I get nothing jobs.

If I get my shame fixed, and I realize I'm an important, valuable person, then I should have a great big, important, valuable job.

But where their thinking goes then is to narcissist, I should be a president of a company, whatever.

So if I'm not doing something super big, then I must still prove that I'm not good enough.

So I want you to think about that with me tonight because it is such an important thing to think through.

So let me give you kind of how God has described how his family operates.

So God said to, He says, I am creating a family that I want to have change the world.

So they're going to put on display love, forgiveness, what healthy living looks like.

And that's going to attract people to say, I want to be part of that family.

I want to be, have all of that in my life as well.

And so He says, He calls that family, it's like a human body.

So think about a human body.

So if you were saying, what part of the human body would I like to be?

Some of you say, I want to be an eye.

Some of you say, I want to be a tongue because I want to talk all the time.

Some of you, I want to be a brain.

How many would sign up to be a lymph node or a vein?

That's a dumb thing.

That's, is it insignificant?

You can't see it, but if you didn't have it, you'd be in big trouble.

You don't see long lineups to become a gallbladder or a kidney.

But what you realize is what the jobs that seem insignificant because they're hidden are just as important and maybe even more important than the job, the parts that everybody can see, that are beautiful.

So you might need a gallbladder more than you need an eye.

All of those things are important to understand.

So what I want you to understand is this.

You got all, you can just picture a bunch of addicts that become a human body and they're all voting saying, who's going to be the brain?

Who's going to be the eye?

Who's going to be the tongue?

Who's going to be the nose?

And they're having fights over who's going to be that.

And then they're, who wants to be the nose?

Who wants to be the little toe?

And all of that.

And they're fighting, I'm not going to be that.

And you begin to realize, my shame is still running this discussion.

My shame is wanting a big prestigious job to prove I'm a big shot and that I have value.

And what I want you to think about tonight is that sometimes God gives the greatest jobs to people who work behind the scenes Do you realize that you see me here on a Friday night?

You don't realize the number of volunteers that make this happen.

It wouldn't be able to happen without all of that.

And so sometimes the biggest responsibilities go to hidden people doing hidden jobs.

They are just as important as the prestigious out front jobs and we need to understand that.

So to do a job that seems insignificant doesn't mean it is insignificant and it doesn't mean I'm insignificant.

So to help you understand that, I want to tell you the story of Moses' parents.

So you know who Moses is.

He was the guy that led Israel out of slavery in Egypt and gave the Ten Commandments and became one of the greatest men in the history of Israel but also in the world.

The Ten Commandments has become the basis of most of society's laws throughout the world.

And so Moses was a man who impacted the entire world not just his generation but all future generations.

You want to know something?

We don't even know his mom and dad's name.

Think about that.

There wouldn't be a Moses without a mom and dad and it wasn't a mom and dad who just gave him birth and left him.

It was a mom and dad who invested into that little life behind the scenes.

So let me give you this story.

So Joseph was that guy that was sold by his brothers and they was taken to slavery in Egypt and then over a period of a number of years he went to become the second in command in Egypt and he, during a time of famine, came up with a plan that got him through the famine so people didn't starve and they had enough food to feed all of the world.

His brothers were in that famine up in Israel and so they came down and Joseph saw them and then they moved down and he gave them a place in the delta for their sheep and it was a fertile place and it let them live kind of isolated and they were living in a place that was isolated from Egyptian culture so that Israel was able to grow without being infected by a lot of the bad stuff of Egyptian culture.

And over the next years they grew to be a nation of three million people.

Well the Pharaoh that was part of Joseph and then after Joseph they died and a new Pharaoh came along who didn't know who Joseph was.

All he knew is that they had three million people who were a threat because they weren't Egyptian they were a foreign people living in his land.

And he felt so threatened by them he decided to instigate a genocide and so every baby boy born to a Jewish mom was to be killed.

And so he was going to wipe out the Jewish people by wiping out all the baby boys.

And so there was this one couple and they got pregnant.

They were the Jewish slaves working as slaves didn't have birth control got pregnant and you can imagine the panic.

Because the law is any baby boy born will be killed and they are freaking out.

And somehow they're very close to God and they have this sense that God has allowed them to become pregnant because that baby in her womb is special.

God has a special plan for that baby.

So they instead of thinking how can we get rid of this baby so it never comes to being born they go how can we protect this baby once it's born.

And so what they decide to do and you've probably heard the stories is they made this little basket out of bulrushes and they put tar around it so it would float in the night.

And they put it in the Nile River and they went to a part of the Nile where there were lots of bulrushes and they stuck it and hid it in there.

And then Moses had an older sister who was eight years old named Miriam and she hung around there all day to make sure nobody stole it and make sure it didn't float away or a crocodile didn't get it.

And so for several months this baby got put in the little basket every day and was hidden in the Nile River.

Can you imagine how stressful that would be?

Every day the mom and the dad are worrying are we going to is somebody going to find the baby today and report it and it will get killed?

Will we get punished if it gets found and reported?

Will they punish all the slaves like are we doing something stupid here?

But no we think God's told us to do this.

So they are just going through all of this.

One day Pharaoh's daughter decides to have her bath right in that part of the Nile River.

And as she's bathing she hears a baby crying and she sends her servants to find out where's that baby crying coming from?

And they look around and they narrow it down and finally they find this little basket and they bring it over to the daughter of Pharaoh and they open it up and they know that it's a baby Jew because it's been circumcised.

And they go this is a Jewish baby.

Now the daughter of Pharaoh knows she should have it killed but she falls in love with this little critter.

And she says I want this baby.

So Miriam at that moment comes out and she acts like oh what did you find?

We found a baby and we need somebody to nurse it.

And Miriam goes I know somebody that could nurse this baby.

And the daughter of Pharaoh says please go find it.

So Miriam goes and gets her mom, Moses' mom and brings her along and says this lady could take care of this baby.

And so Pharaoh says he's all yours please take care of it.

And so for several years God gave Moses back to them.

And they got to invest their life into that little boy.

Now can you imagine them going to a different place and going to a dinner party?

Not that they would have them.

But if they went to a dinner party and all the people are saying wow I just got a new job and I'm the head of this department and all of this.

What are you doing Moses' mom?

I'm just spending time with my boy telling him about God.

Teaching him how to tie his shoes.

How to deal with other people.

How to be honest.

Wow that's a waste of time.

That's not very significant.

You could be doing something much more impactful on our world.

No I think God wants me to just invest in this little boy.

Okay.

I'm going to pursue my dreams.

You do whatever you want.

So that is what is going on.

At some point Moses gets taken from his true mom and gets moved into the palace with his adopted mom.

And then 80 years later he becomes the leader of Israel and changes the world.

So let me get you to think about a couple things.

In the Bible we are told Amran and Jacobed.

Now we are not sure if that is saying that is what his parents' names were because it is not clear.

It is possible it is not who his parents are.

It could just be a relative.

So the point is we don't know who Moses' parents are for sure.

And the point of that is this.

If you go back through history and I have done this in my own life.

Do you realize that some of the greatest changes in our world came through hidden people?

People that nobody noticed?

Do you realize there is a little shepherd boy that nobody wanted and all his brothers thought he was kind of useless and they stuck him with the sheep?

He changed the world.

And then this Moses guy.

And then there was this weird guy that was out in the desert.

And he ate grasshoppers and ate honey and just lived this really weird life.

He helped change the world.

And you can go on and on and on.

So people who served God in what seemed like insignificant ways made huge impacts on our world today.

So do you realize that to serve God in an insignificant way really requires a lot of faith?

Because you say, I'm trusting that you're in this and there's a point to what I'm doing.

I'm trusting that it's somehow helping make out your plan to be what it wants.

So I don't see any results but I'm trusting.

And that is what is required.

And so it is hard to serve in insignificant ways especially if you're not seeing immediate results.

You want to know the thing about parenting?

So Moses' mother went through and father?

You invest your life in these kids and you go, so what kind of results are you seeing in your kids?

Are they changing the world?

No, they just learned to blow their nose by themselves.

Wow, that's significant.

Do you know when they start to make an impact on the world?

After you've invested 20, 30 years in them.

Then you start to see the impact.

You start to see results.

That means you go 20, 30 years of faithfully investing in them.

Faithfully role modeling to them.

Faithfully teaching them tools and helping them without seeing a whole lot of results.

It is investment that you don't get a return on for a number of years.

And that's how some of the work that God asks us to do is to make a difference.

Do you realize that most of the people that wrote the Bible, they didn't know anybody would ever read what they wrote?

David wrote some stuff just in his personal journal.

He didn't think it would impact anybody.

He didn't think it would help anybody.

Now it has helped millions of people thousands of years later.

They did not see immediate results during their lifetime.

It was future generations that saw the benefits of what they did.

And that we have to factor in.

So we've talked about sometimes huge doors swing on really small hinges.

Sometimes world events swing on very small hinges.

99.9% of the world was totally aware of a slave in Egypt and her little baby.

Nobody cared about that part of the world.

Nobody cared about the Jewish people there.

Nobody thought they would ever amount to anything.

Everybody wrote them off as insignificant.

But they weren't.

And it wasn't until 80 years later that that all changed.

So, my point.

We aren't qualified to measure whether what we're doing is significant or not.

Shame makes us want to think a lot of stuff is insignificant because we don't see immediate results and we don't see them in a big way.

But what I want you to get from this story is we've got to rethink what having value in God's world means and sometimes God calls us to what seems like a significant hidden job that doesn't seem to have many positive results but it might.

Maybe not in your lifetime.

And we trust God for that.

So, here's what I want you to understand.

Big, big picture outside of this.

So let me take you away from Moses' parents.

God is wanting to raise up a leader to lead his people out of Egypt and he's wanting to change the world.

How is he going to do that?

He has to get somebody who understands Egyptian politics.

Somebody that people in Egyptian politics would pay attention to.

And they're not going to do that with just a Jewish person.

So how is he going to pull that off?

Oh, bingo.

Let's take a Jewish boy, have him adopted by Pharaoh's daughter so he grows up in two worlds.

And understands two worlds.

And rubs shoulders in two worlds.

Then, when I want to deliver Israel, he can march right into Pharaoh's court and say, Grandpa, let my people go.

I don't know if it's grandpa or not.

But he could do that because he was known there.

And that was what God pulled off.

In a magical, mysterious way.

And so, if you look at the people who changed the world, just take Paul, who changed the world.

It's fascinating to me, he grew up a Jew in a Gentile world.

So he understood the Jewish world and the Gentile world.

And he could bring the two together.

You see that all over the place.

So if God brought you up in a white home, but you're an indigenous person, you understand two worlds.

Now maybe up to now, you have felt you didn't fit into either world.

I'm sure Moses felt that way.

But he understood both worlds.

And God had a purpose for that.

And now, he could work in both worlds and bring them together.

So God often takes people and makes them like misfits, but they grow up in two worlds and through that can change a big part of the world.

So, I don't know what God's going to get you to do as you grow on in your recovery.

I suspect some of you will become great spokespersons for God.

And you will have public roles like I do.

Some of you will work quietly behind the scenes.

And you will never be noticed, but your job is just as significant.

And I hope you can see that.

Let me end with this.

My mother just died, just over a month ago, in her 80's.

My mom was shy, worse than I'm shy.

My mom never, I never once saw her take a public role.

I never once saw her teach, preach, pray in public, do anything like that.

My dad did all of that.

She did all the organizing, budgeting, managing.

She did a million jobs unseen by God.

Behind the scenes.

You want to know when I was at the funeral?

I said this, how do you measure greatness and godliness?

Is it by great jobs and public eye?

I said no.

The greatest heroes to me, the most godly person I ever have known, is my mother.

She never did anything in public.

But she modeled for me a consistent love and faithfulness.

She accepted me and connected with me when nobody else could.

And she showed me God's love in a way nobody else did.

So was she significant?

You bet she was.

Did anybody else see it?

No.

And that's maybe what God's going to call you to.

And I just hope you realize that that doesn't mean you're insignificant in any way.

Do we sleep together at your house anymore?

I should have not got hungover.

I would forget about you.

We still have Box.

I sleep at everyone's house.

We sleep together at everyone's house,
