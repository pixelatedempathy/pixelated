many people with complex trauma have a low-grade depression. There's just constantly a sadness that is there. So I think it's important to understand that I think complex trauma contributes to depression in a bunch of different ways. So we tend to think of depression, we kind of just put it in a general box. You're depressed. There must be a chemical imbalance in the brain. That could be true. But I think complex trauma helps us realize there's other factors that feed depression besides just chemical imbalance in the brain. So think first of all of a child, what we talked about at the beginning, where your emotions basically exist in a negative environment. You constantly are feeling pain. You can't resolve. That pain is getting worse. Your needs aren't being met. You feel empty. You can't connect. There's all kinds of negative emotions that just grow, grow, grow. Then your circumstances, there's constant danger. There's constant stress. So your circumstances feed these negative emotions. So the negative of your life far outweighs the positives. That just takes its toll. That gradually grinds you into deeper and deeper depression. But there's something else. When a child is in complex trauma, they're constantly in danger or precarious. They're in perceived danger. So they're in their sympathetic nervous system all the time. Their parasympathetic nervous system, whose purpose is to provide rest and healing and balance to your nervous system so that you don't burn out, isn't allowed to kick in. And so your go, go, go survival mode, energy mode without the necessary rest and healing. Over time, you're heading towards burnout. What we realize is that sometimes depression kicks in as a way to try and get you out of your sympathetic nervous system into your parasympathetic nervous system. It's trying to protect you from totally burning out. Another thing is this. When you're stuffing emotions all the time, it's like trying to hold a beach ball. Under the water, it takes a lot of emotional energy to hold down anger, to hold down fear, to hold down all the guilt that you feel, to hold down all of the different emotions that you feel. You repress, repress, repress, and you just get exhausted emotionally. And that can result in depression. Dissociation is another element here that leads to depression. So trauma, if it's trauma, it's a lot of stress. It's a lot of stress. So severe. The brain's way of protecting is to retreat to an internal world, to dissociate from the present. And often what it's saying is my nervous system is overwhelmed from this trauma. I need a way to escape my nervous system. And depression becomes a way to help a person escape living within their nervous system that is overwhelmed. Then there's another thing. What happens with shame is I don't like myself. I hate myself. I'm angry at myself. I'm critical of myself. So anger turns inward. And anger turned inward can lead to depression. And then, sadly for many people, depression has been their normal since they were little kids. Every day sucked. Every day they were in their sympathetic mode. But the idea of what loss really actually happens is that time as we leave our neural positive system is dropped into depression and we become addicted to emotion and shit. Love doesn't mean that there's no way out. Love is whenorrhinton faishtht necklace. We only live together without self. Love is more our life and our life as we live together. So Alberich provides a quote called self´ . Buroga says, It was Schönstall and I´m a teacher in Fr socrette systems in their debate behavior to try to keep them feeling depressed it's almost like they're addicted to needing to feel depressed to feel normal another element that feeds into this is one of the most important things to stabilize us to give us the positive chemicals in the brain is connection with safe people true healthy intimacy if I don't have connection I don't have those four chemicals and then depression begins to settle in one of the greatest healing elements of depression is beginning to connect with healthy safe people again and then there's one other thing that comes out of the shame thing and it's shame lies that we tell ourselves so nobody wants to connect with me you know we're not going to connect with anybody who gets to know me will reject me or abandon me I only have value if I perform my value comes from my external world I have no inherent value if I set boundaries I am a bad person I'm selfish I'm unloving if I take care of myself I am selfish and of loving in order for people to like me I have to be perfect I have to give up all my needs I have to become smaller if I fail I am a failure when you believe those lies that leads to depression so complex trauma just can feed depression in many different ways there's one other one that's tricky what comes out of complex trauma is a lot of grief you have a lot of losses not just things that you had that you lost but you also have things that you should have had but never got so you lost something that you should have had but never had that's a very real loss so part of what happens is the child is constantly experiencing losses and one of the elements or stages of grief is sadness depression this sucks I should be sad I should feel depressed but some people get stuck there no from most people when they go through a loss the sad stage it can go on for weeks for months for years for even years it's part of the limbic brain gradually coming to terms and accepting the reality of what has happened and being able to let go but what I have found with people from complex trauma is that often they get stuck in the sadness stage there's something in them because they've never fully connected with anybody that just has trouble letting go there's something in them that feels guilty for moving on there's something in them that just it fits into their default setting of depression and so to go on and enjoy life again feels wrong so they get stuck in this sadness stage of grieving and it just keeps the depression alive it keeps them having a reason to justify staying in this depressed state we've got some questions for you Dr. Zionist, you got a question under the table for Mr. Zionist. it's so important to say that most people from complex trauma have dealt with depression over 90 percent and that means that most have had suicidal ideation at some time because life sucks the brain thinks it would i've tried everything to escape this pain i've tried everything to resolve this pain there's no solution that i have been able to find therefore it makes sense that the only solution left is to kill myself to have suicidal ideation doesn't mean you're planning to act on it it just means your brain is continuing to explore options to escape the pain so don't beat yourself up about it recognize that it happens and continue to reach out for help so one of the things that i've realized with many people from complex trauma is they've lived with mild depression as their normal or depression deeper depression as their normal their default setting and so they don't even think they're depressed because that's been their normal that's how they think everybody is and so it's important to begin to understand the signs of depression so that i can begin to identify whether i am depressed or not so signs of depression you feel like you're being sucked into this black hole that there's just a darkness that is pulling at you you begin to lose interest in things that usually you enjoy you begin to lose motivation to do things even the things that you enjoyed those are signs of depression losing interest losing motivation when you do stuff that you normally would have given you pleasure it's not giving you pleasure anymore so more and more of life becomes drudgery more and more and more of life takes effort you feel more and more robotic you're going through the motions nothing is giving you pleasure and then there's a growing feelings of worthlessness i have nothing to offer my life sucks i'm not a happy person nobody wants to be with me i feel i can't i don't have the energy to perform anything i just have this growing feeling of worthlessness and then there's a growing feeling of helplessness i can't get myself out of this i just am growing and feeling overwhelmed more and more i i'm losing the ability to cope with anything those are growing inside of you then that leads to growing feelings of antisocial i just want to flight i want to avoid people i resist social interaction it just takes too much work i'm not in a good headspace it creates panic so i just want to isolate all the time then there's a usually growing irritability i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace i'm not in a good headspace you just don't have the emotional reserves to handle problems to handle change to handle annoyances then you be get more negative more pessimistic you just see the dark the negative side of things and then for people that can lead to change in weight change in appetite you you don't want to eat at all or you want to eat all the time change in sleep patterns you want to sleep all the time or you can't sleep for some people they begin to have physical pain on top of the emotional pain others they begin to get tired overwhelming fatigue is constantly there they have difficulty concentrating on anything and it begins to affect their memory so those are all characteristics of deepening depression so if you have those reach out for help learn from the experience and learn from the experience and learn from the experience and learning to manage depression learning to improve depression becomes such a vital part in recovery there's a ton of tools to learn but it is so important but there is hope the final one i want to cover today is wanting to hope but being afraid to hope this one is so important to understand what happens to a child is they come into they have this need to be authentic, this need to have all their needs met. So they've got 12 basic needs. Their parents are supposed to meet those needs. Their parents, let's say, don't meet some of the needs. The child then has this basic hope. And the hope is, if I change, it must be my fault. If I change, if I do something differently, then my parents will meet my needs. So there's a little graph there where the child, their need isn't met. They go, if I change, then my need will get met, and they have hope. And so they start to go down the change road with the hope road, and it might look like, oh, it's going to work, it's going to work, but then their need doesn't get met. So what has happened? There are two dynamics. Their need is not met, that hurts. Their hope is dashed, and that hurts. So they have two sources of pain. Now, but children have this tremendous capacity to hope. So where their brain goes next is, oh, okay, if I just tried this thing, then I'll get my need met. And they hope again, and away they go. And they pursue this new option with great hope. And then that option backfires. So their need doesn't get met, their hopes get dashed. But children have tremendous capacity to hope. So they come up with another option, and they have, oh, hope that it's going to work. What we have seen is that a child would do that for year after year after year, continue to hope, continue to come up with new options. And then around 10 to 12, 13 years old, something in the brain goes, you know what, I'm getting tired of getting my hopes up and having them dashed. That hurts a lot. Nothing seems to be working. It's really feeling hopeless. It feels like there's nothing. It feels like there's nothing. It feels like there's not nothing. It feels like there's nothing. It feels like there's nothing. It feels like there's not a solution. So I'm not going to get my hopes up again. Because to have my hopes dashed actually hurts more than not having my needs met. So they stop hoping. And that's when many children go into drugs, alcohol, into very hardened, maladaptive behaviors, because I'm not even going to try anymore. I'm just going to live for instant pleasure, however I can get it. So they come into recovery. And what is recovery based on? There's hope that you can heal. There's hope that you can get healthy. And they go, nope, not going to hope. But they want to hope. They desire to have a healthy life. They desire to heal. So initially, often you have to piggyback on somebody else's hope. And they go, you know what, I've been through this. I've gone through the steps. I've gone through the steps. I've gone through the steps. I've gone through the steps. I've done the work and it pays off. There is grounds for hope based on evidence. What you had as a child was a child trying to gain hope out of a solution that wasn't even viable. Because the problem wasn't you. The problem was the other person. What you have now is a viable solution. So hope is legitimate. That's scary for a child. And so what can happen for many people in recovery is they piggyback on hope. And they go, nope, not going to hope. And they go, nope, not going to hope. They start to piggyback off somebody else's hope. They start to see their life improve. They get their health back. They get their job back. They start to get relationships back. They get their kids back. And positive things are happening there. And all of a sudden their hope starts to go from piggybacking off somebody else's to hope is starting to be born inside of them. And they go, oh, oh, oh, do I get my hopes up that this is going to work? Because if I get my hopes up and then it doesn't work, my hopes are going to get dashed again and that is so painful and so what many people do in recovery as soon as they start to hope again is a system switches on in the brain that says nope hope is too dangerous let's sabotage all the good stuff happening in our life let's go back to pain and not hoping because it feels safer there so this desire to hope but afraid to hope is a powerful subconscious system that works in people and can do so much damage in recovery and so it's so important for people to realize in recovery that okay i'm starting to hope but my hope is based on viable solutions hope has been proven by other people who've done this stuff so i'm not going to give into my limbic brain and go to sabotage i am going to stay in my cortex and get past the fear of my hopes being dashed again and stick at this long enough for it to prove that it's working and that my hope is legitimate that is such a critical piece for people in their recovery journey it helps me to forget that i don't know where i am and that i've managed to do more than i can i'm so filled with hope that my hope has been fully understood and i've had skills that let me some hope have meant a lot to me i follow aMy host life lessons at the heart of y итог dose to see dot com alternative voice calling me desktop and i started to drink drugs i'm with a friend in my little big community with a friend called my third uncle there we walked おくちゃん live перед meえる when my father died to passion principally ınız miguel he was a striving shifts yet my mother started to help me Equétais he was very kind to me and i understood the relationships right to be in that conversation everybody was engaged with me and to be a friend and it was true that no one was nothing but my mom i'm afraid what if they operating left abroad my partner
