# Emergency Response Procedures
# ============================

## Emergency Classification

### Severity Levels
- **P0 (Critical):** Complete service outage, data breach, security incident
- **P1 (High):** Partial service outage, performance degradation affecting >50% users

## Response Procedures

### P0 Critical Incidents

#### Immediate Response (0-15 minutes)
1. **Incident Detection**
   - Automated monitoring alerts
   - Customer reports
   - Team member identification

2. **Initial Actions**
   ```bash
   # Acknowledge alert in monitoring system
   # Create incident in incident management system
   # Page on-call engineer
   # Assemble core response team
   ```

3. **Communication**
   - Post in #incidents Slack channel
   - Update status page
   - Notify key stakeholders

#### Assessment Phase (15-30 minutes)
1. **Situation Assessment**
   ```bash
   # Check overall system health
   kubectl get pods --all-namespaces
   kubectl get nodes
   
   # Check application health
   curl -I https://pixelated-empathy.com/health
   
   # Check database connectivity
   pg_isready -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT
   
   # Check external dependencies
   curl -I https://api.external-service.com/health
   ```

2. **Impact Analysis**
   - Determine affected services
   - Estimate user impact
   - Assess data integrity
   - Identify potential causes

3. **Decision Making**
   - Choose recovery strategy
   - Assign team responsibilities
   - Set recovery timeline
   - Plan communication updates

#### Recovery Phase (30+ minutes)
1. **Execute Recovery Plan**
   ```bash
   # Example: Database failover
   ./scripts/database-failover.sh
   
   # Example: Application rollback
   kubectl rollout undo deployment/pixelated-empathy
   
   # Example: Scale up resources
   kubectl scale deployment/pixelated-empathy --replicas=10
   ```

2. **Monitor Progress**
   - Track recovery metrics
   - Validate service restoration
   - Monitor for secondary issues
   - Update stakeholders regularly

3. **Validation**
   ```bash
   # Verify application health
   ./scripts/health-check-comprehensive.sh
   
   # Verify user functionality
   ./scripts/smoke-tests.sh
   
   # Check performance metrics
   ./scripts/performance-validation.sh
   ```

### P1 High Priority Incidents

#### Response Timeline: 1 hour
1. **Assessment (0-15 minutes)**
   - Identify affected components
   - Assess user impact
   - Determine urgency

2. **Mitigation (15-45 minutes)**
   - Implement temporary fixes
   - Scale resources if needed
   - Monitor improvement

3. **Resolution (45-60 minutes)**
   - Apply permanent fix
   - Validate resolution
   - Update documentation

### Security Incident Response

#### Immediate Actions (0-30 minutes)
1. **Containment**
   ```bash
   # Isolate affected systems
   kubectl cordon <affected-node>
   kubectl drain <affected-node> --ignore-daemonsets
   
   # Block suspicious traffic
   kubectl apply -f security/emergency-network-policy.yaml
   
   # Disable compromised accounts
   ./scripts/disable-user-account.sh <user-id>
   ```

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   ```bash
   # Create system snapshots
   kubectl exec <pod-name> -- tar -czf /tmp/evidence.tar.gz /var/log/
   
   # Preserve network logs
   kubectl logs deployment/nginx-ingress-controller > /tmp/network-logs.txt
   
   # Database audit logs
   psql -h $DB_HOST -c "SELECT * FROM audit_log WHERE timestamp > NOW() - INTERVAL '1 hour';"
   ```

#### Investigation Phase (30 minutes - 24 hours)
1. **Forensic Analysis**
   - Analyze system logs
   - Review access patterns
   - Identify attack vectors
   - Assess data exposure

2. **Scope Assessment**
   - Determine affected data
   - Identify compromised systems
   - Assess timeline of compromise
   - Evaluate ongoing threats

#### Recovery and Notification (24-72 hours)
1. **System Hardening**
   ```bash
   # Apply security patches
   ./scripts/security-patches.sh
   
   # Update access controls
   kubectl apply -f security/enhanced-rbac.yaml
   
   # Rotate credentials
   ./scripts/rotate-all-credentials.sh
   ```

2. **Notifications**
   - Internal stakeholders
   - Affected customers
   - Regulatory bodies (if required)
   - Law enforcement (if required)
