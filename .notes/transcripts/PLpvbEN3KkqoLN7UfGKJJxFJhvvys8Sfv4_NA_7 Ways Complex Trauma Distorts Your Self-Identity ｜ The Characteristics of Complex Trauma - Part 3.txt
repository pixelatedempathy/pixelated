 Welcome to another Friday night. We've just got into a new series that's really a remake  of an old series on the characteristics of complex trauma and the old series had 60 characteristics  and we're up to over 85 characteristics of complex trauma. Now, and what I wanted to do was  just pull all of these characteristics together in a summary format so that you get the big picture  of the ramifications of complex trauma. How it affects every part of life, how we cope, how we relate,  how we see yourself, our body, our immune system, our central nervous system, our brain, it's just  massive. So, we spent the first two talks talking about how it affects our body and our brain  and our immune system, our central nervous system. Today, I want to come to what I think is  the aspect of complex trauma that is the most damaging, that has the most far-reaching  negative effects, that is the most tragic and that is shame. That complex trauma reshapes a child's  self-identity from a positive to a negative. No, we've done a whole series on shame and I don't want  to go through it again, I just want to summarize it. But what we're going to see is complex trauma  causes shame and then shame is really where a lot of the characteristics then come from. They're  the attempt of the person to hide their shame, to compensate for their shame, to feel better about  themselves together, they're all responses to shame which comes out of complex trauma. So,  this shame is just a massive thing. The problem is, is that in our culture it's either not understood  at all, not talked about a concept that's not even recognized as being important or it's misunderstood  by many people. And so, there's the majority of our culture that think they don't have shame.  When the reality is, they're full of shame, they're controlled by shame. Shame is one of the most  powerful negative influences in their life and they're not even aware of it. The common misunderstanding  around shame is that people just think of shame as an emotion and it is an emotion.  So, we hear all the time, you should be ashamed of yourself and so we immediately identify  or I understand the emotion of shame. But what I want you to understand is that emotion of shame  comes out of a deeper element of shame which is it's a core belief about myself. It's a core  belief that I'm not good enough, that something is wrong with me. The next issue for many people is  that shame has been confused with guilt and so they get blended together. Now, what's important  to understand is that shame and guilt overlap, they influence each other but they're very distinct.  So, the simple way to understand it is shame is about who I am, my identity.  Guilt is about what I do. So, if I do something that violates love, I lie, I cheat, I betray somebody,  then I should feel guilt. It's a good thing. It's something that I can then resolve and get rid of.  But shame is about who I am and it's based on lies and so the child can't resolve it. So,  it's a very very negative destructive thing. So, let me just again explain very briefly what shame  where it comes from. Every child comes into the world with really inherent questions that are  subconscious, but they're asking, do I have value? Do I matter? Do I have anything to offer? Am I  lovable? Am I desirable? And how do they get the answers to those questions? So, the question,  do I matter? The only way they get an answer to that is, do I matter to mum and dad? Do I matter  to you? Am I lovable? Am I lovable to mum and dad? Am I lovable to you? So, another way to look at that  is the child basically sees mum and dad as mirrors, mirrors that reflect back to them who they are.  So, we think of mirrors that reflect back to us a physical picture of who we are. That metaphor then,  if you applied to mum and dad, is they reflect back a picture of who the child is as a person,  their personality, their value, whether they're lovable. So, how mum and dad treat the child,  speak to the child, reflects back to the child a picture of who they are. So, if you think of a  healthy home where a child is fully authentic, mum and dad respond by accepting them, meeting their  needs, connecting with them, loving them, nurturing them, what is the message that the child gets? What  does the mere reflect? You are lovable. You have value. You are worth something. The child gets  a positive self-identity, but what happens in complex trauma? The child is neglected. The child  is abused. The child's needs are not met. What does the child conclude? So, they start to believe  certain things. So, the first thing they believe is, it must be my fault. The reason mum and dad aren't  meeting my needs, the reason mum and dad are neglecting and abusing me is, I must be bad. I  must not be lovable. I must not be good enough. I must not have value. So, all of a sudden, they're starting  to believe things about themselves that are negative. But then, it goes further. They go to a third  belief, which is, if I'm authentic, I won't be good enough. Being authentic causes you to get  rejected. So, if I'm authentic, I will be rejected. So, now, in a relationship, if anybody gets to  know the true me, they will reject me. They will not want to connect with me. So, what you begin to  see is the child, instead of developing a positive self-identity, they have developed a negative self-identity  that I am not good enough. I am not lovable. I am not valuable. I am less than. I'm inferior.  Anybody that gets to know me is going to neglect me, abuse me, not meet my needs, reject me.  But what I want you to see is that identity. The child thinks is the truth. They think that  mum and dad have reflected back to them a true message about themselves. The child cannot see that  it's a lie. That it's mum and dad that have the issues that they have great value. They are lovable.  It's mum and dad that have some problems. So, they base their whole identity on lies. That's  so tragic. But then, what begins to happen is it changes the child's priorities. So, the child comes  into the world with this naturally giving authentic, loving approach to life. Now, they still  want to be giving and loving. But the highest priority now is I got to hide myself. I can't  be authentic. So, the number one priority is not love now. The number one priority is I got to hide.  I still hope I get love. I still hope that others respect me. I still want to love others, but it can  never threaten hiding the true me. Because if they get to know the true me, they will reject me.  So, that then leads to another priority. In order for them to love me and respect me,  I have to compensate for what I believe is the true me. I have to become something different,  something that they would respect, something that they would love, something they would like,  something that will cause them to want to meet my needs and have a relationship with me.  Being authentic is the greatest crime. So, that's shame. That is a core identity. And what I want  you to understand is that for most people, they're not even aware of that. It's subconscious. It is  pushed down so far, often even denied that they have any shame at all, but it controls their life.  All of their relationships, all of their interactions with people, when you start to break it down,  you begin to realize it's controlled by this shame belief. That if they get to know me, they will  reject me. As I am by myself, I am not good enough. So, with that as kind of the overriding thing that  comes out of complex trauma, all of the other characteristics I'm going to give you now and the next  couple weeks come out of shame. It's an attempt of the brain to hide, to compensate for shame, to try  to be good enough, to feel better about themself, to try and get their needs met. All of these other  characteristics are the brain trying to come up with solutions to the shame identity.  So, let's go into them. Number one is I must wear masks or develop personas. So, if anybody gets  to know the authentic me, they will reject me. So, if you look at this diagram, you have the belief  of the child that the true me is bad. It leads to rejection. So, I must exit out or hide it.  I can't be authentic. So, basically, let's lose self. Therefore, we must develop a bunch of personas  around this hidden part of me that I think everybody will like, everybody will respect. And then within  their mind, they have this ideal self persona. If only I was like this, everybody would like me,  everybody would love me. And so, in their mind, it's their only way to get love, respect, to get  their needs met, to feel better about themself. In order to feel better about myself, I must get  others to feel good about me. And then I will piggyback off their feelings of me. So,  early on, children begin to develop different roles. Ways of behaving, patterns of behaving, that  they think will get their needs met, that will maybe make dad less angry, make dad more interested in  them, solve some of the problems in the family to make a more healthy family. So, some children go  to the hero. I am going to be the perfect child. I'm going to take care of everybody's needs.  I'm going to get straight A's in school. I'm going to do lots of chores. I'm going to take care  of everybody. I will be the hero. And they do that. And it looks like they're a wonderful child.  It looks like they don't have any issues. But they're trying to earn love. They're trying to get  their needs met. Some children go to the comedian or the gesture. I'll be funny all the time.  I will keep things light. I will tell funny stories. I'll make people laugh. Then everybody will  like me. Then there'll be less anger, intention in the family. Then if everybody likes me because  I'm so funny, then people will want to be my friend. People will want to connect with me. People  will meet my needs. People will respect me. That's the solution to my shame, as I will become a  funny man. And if they're kind of naturally funny, and then they get validated for funny,  that just sends them down that road where they have to be funny all the time. They've got to keep  things light. You can't get serious. You can't go deep. You've got to be superficial. Then some go  to becoming the invisible child. And that's the child that says, the way to get my needs met is to  never make demands to basically be a poster child to never cause any problems, to never rock the  boat, to not have any needs. So I'll hang out in my room. I will never cause trouble. I will never express  my opinion, my needs. I will be this invisible child which basically can become a lost child.  And so if you look at those first three, they look to be like, wow, this is a wonderful family.  This is a family where everybody's getting along. Everybody is trying to make this family work so  well. It looks great. But what's happening is they're all trying to conform to try to get the neglect  and abuse to stop. To get the person and authority who's abusing their authority to start being nice  to them, to start meeting their needs. And they're conforming to what they think will the person and  authority wants. But then you usually always have the fourth role. And that's the child who refuses to  conform. Because the others are conforming, but they're also suppressing their needs. They're also  not being authentic. They're not saying my needs matter just as much as the authorities. They're not  demanding that they be treated the same way the authority wants to be treated. But the third one  becomes known as the problem child. They're the honest one. They're the one that says, hey,  this family's sick. I am not going to allow you to treat me as if I don't matter. I am going to make  a noise if I'm neglected or abused. And so now what the family does is says, all of our problems are  due to this child. And they become the scapegoat. They become the one that gets blamed for all the  family's problems. Instead of saying, you know what, I think we got a bit of a narcissist running the  show in the in the authority. That's the real problem. But now the child gets blamed. So those  are some of the roles that get developed. And sometimes some parents will put children into roles.  They'll expect one child to be hero. They'll expect another child to be invisible. And so a child  can get forced into those roles. Many children will try different roles and see which one  suits them best. And they're they get good at kind of jumping from role to role depending  on who they're with. That then makes them chameleons. They can become whatever the other person needs  them to be. So what is happening here is when a child is too little to fight or flight. So they still  need mom and dad to meet their needs. They can't run away. They can't fight back. So they have to  fawn. They go to the fourth f. And that is kind of the ultimate survival skill, which basically is  I need you to like me so that you will meet my needs. And so what they then do is I will be whatever  you want me to be. Just love me. Just meet my needs. So they become highly attuned to their parents  moods their parents beliefs their parents opinions. And they adapt. And I will become more attuned  to what you need than what I need to what you believe. I will think like you. I don't even know what I  believe. I don't even know what I feel, but I sure know what you feel. And I will adapt to be in every  situation whatever you need me to be. That is funny. And that is the ultimate survival skill.  So that becomes what we know as the next characteristic is that most people with complex trauma  become people pleasers. Because for children who have got most complex trauma happens to somebody as  a child. And so they're ultimate. They can't fight her flight. So they have to learn to survive.  And so fawning is I become whatever you want. I say yes to everybody. I do whatever everybody  else is want. I suppress my needs. And so the brain is actually seeing the solution to the problem  as let's create mirrors that actually become positive. I think I can get these mirrors to change from  neglecting me and abusing me to actually liking me. It's all on me. If I just do this, if I just  become this, if I just give them whatever they want, if I just take care of all of their needs,  if I fix all of their problems, then they will become positive mirrors who constantly reflect  the positive message to me. They are taking the weight of the world on themself to fix the family,  thinking it's their problem. If only they would do a bit more. If only they would give their needs  up a bit more, but it is all fear-based. So let me just say this. There's a healthy desire in every  child to please. That's wonderful. That's their loving nature. But this is not just a healthy desire  to please. This is now a desperation to survive. This is a fear of getting hurt again. So now I am  pleasing not just to give with no strings attached. Now I am pleasing, pleasing, pleasing, hoping that  you will love me, hoping that you will meet my needs, hoping that you will think positively of me.  So what comes out of this shame, this mask wearing, this people pleasing is such a common problem for  most people with complex trauma, and that is they don't know who they are. I have had so many clients  say to me, Tim, I'm 50 years old, I don't have a clue who I am. I have spent all my life  fawning, wearing masks, adopting roles, being a chameleon, I don't have a clue who I am.  So that is a huge challenge for people in recovery. So let me just take that  characteristic and kind of go to what do I do about it? What's the path forward in recovery to get  to know who I am? Because that's really what we want to come out of these understanding these  characteristics is yeah, that's an issue to be 50 years old and don't have a clue who you are.  How do I change that? So what I want you to think about is this. The child who's in complex trauma,  they're wearing masks, they're fawning, but more than that, they're in survival mode.  And when a child's in survival mode, the focus of their brain is surviving, it's not exploring,  it's not having fun, it's not going oh, I wonder what I like. It's how do I not get hurt? How do I  get my needs met? So when it comes to the other thing for many children in complex trauma,  is they were expected to conform to being the hero child, being the invisible child,  being on a path to becoming a doctor or a lawyer, to kind of fit the roles and jobs that the  parents had decided the child should have. So if they decided to pursue their interests or their  passions, they got shut down for that, they got criticized for that, shame for that. So they weren't  allowed to explore, they weren't allowed to pursue their passions on top of having to fawn and  be a chameleon. So how does a child normally in a safe healthy environment get to know who they are?  And so this is so important to understand in recovery, you first have to have safe people who aren't  going to judge you, a safe environment. What does a child do in that safe environment? They play,  they explore, they're curious. And they try hundreds of different things, all kinds of sports, all kinds  of hobbies, all kinds of different interests. One day they want to be a doctor, one day they want  to be a fireman, one day they want to be a hockey player. They are trying all kinds of different things  as they do that without fear of judgment. They don't only see failure as a problem. That's just part  of all of this. They get to realize what I'm good at, what my talents are, what my skills are,  what connects to my deepest passions, what connects to a life purpose that I want, that I didn't even  know I had. And out of that, they begin to know who they are. But think about that. That can take 20 years.  So if you come into recovery and you don't have a clue who you are, don't expect that you are going  to figure it out in a week or a month, give yourself lots of time to figure it out.  But then, with safe people and a safe non-judgmental environment, begin to explore all kinds of hobbies,  all kinds of interests. Find out what you're good at. Find out what your passion is.  So most people, after they go through our program, they begin to have a vague sense of who  their authentic self is. It's kind of a fuzzy, blurry image, but they're starting to get a vague sense.  Over the next years, they begin to try different things. They volunteer in different places. They  try different hobbies. And they get a clearer and clearer picture. One of the things that helps  many people is they can take a personality test. They start to read different books that help people  understand some of their desires, some of their talents, and they begin to get a clearer and  clearer picture of who they are. So don't beat yourself up. That you might be 50 and don't know  yourself. Just go, okay, this is where I'm at. Now, I'm going to give myself permission to be a child  and to begin to explore and to begin to try all kinds of different hobbies. Now for a lot of people,  this triggers another part of complex trauma, which we're going to get to later, and that is fear  of failure. So they start a new hobby, and they go, I need to do it perfectly the first time,  but they can't. They're uncoordinated. They make mistakes. It's kind of awkward, and they go, oh,  I quit. No, get through that. Get past that fear of failure. It takes time to learn, and that's a  gradual process where things aren't perfect the first time. Then you start to get a clearer,  clearer picture of who you are. And once you do, that clarifying sense of self-identity,  as your shame is also healing, is so wonderful. Something inside changes. Something inside feels  lighter. There's a light there now that wasn't there before. Okay, let's go to the next characteristic  that comes out of shame. And that is people with shame tend to judge themselves harshly. They tend  to be very hard on themself. So if you were to get inside their brain on any given day, you would hear  hundreds of messages in their brain that are criticizing everything they do that are putting  themself down in every situation. And if they fail, then they beat themself up royally. Part of that  is a belief that that's how you motivate somebody to improve is you put them down. That comes out of  their parenting. Also part of that comes out of if I fail, then I need to serve the time. Justice  needs to be done. I need to be punished for my crime. And I can't be led out of jail till I've served  the time, which is I got to beat myself down for a couple days. So if we go back to our diagram,  what you have with you hide the true self, you create these personas, then you have this internal  critic. Now the internal critic is actually doing two things. He is criticizing everything that you do  because it doesn't match the ideal self. Oh, you could be better. You could have been done that  better if only you had like this. So it's constantly comparing the persona to the ideal self and  constant failure. So constant criticism, but it's also being critical by saying you're fake.  This is a false persona. This is not the true you. You have imposter syndrome. If people knew the true  you, they would never love you. And so this internal critic has constant fodder to feed the mill that  basically says you're phony and everything you do is never good enough. And so this internal critic  for most people with complex trauma is very loud. It's very constant and it just constantly feeds  shame. It constantly makes them feel even worse. It constantly seems to confirm that negative identity  that they aren't good enough. And so it becomes this loop that just feeds off itself. Now let me take you  back to where some of this began. So what happens for many children in complex trauma is they have  parents who neglect them or they're critical. They abuse them. They're negative. They find fault.  Whatever the child does there doesn't seem to be good enough. They're constantly sending verbal  and nonverbal negative messages to the child. So what is happening in the child's brain is they're  absorbing those messages. They're believing those messages. And they're developing an internal  parent in their brain, the IP. That is basically parenting what their actual parents say and how they  act toward them. That's basically shame. And so that internal parent just expresses the shame belief.  But then there's another piece to this and that is this usually happens gradually. So let me give you an  example. So the child is crying and parents get frustrated with the crying and saying big boys don't cry.  That's so weak. Go to your room and don't come out to you. Stop crying or if you're going to keep crying  and I punish you for give you something to cry about. And so all of a sudden crying to them is such a  weakness. It causes them to get hurt and punished and shamed. And so they hate that weak part of  themself that they're so that they cry so much that they're so sensitive. And so now they go I hate  this part of myself. Let's lock it away. Then they get told they're too fat. I hate that I'm fat.  I hate my body. Then they get told that they're too angry. I hate that I'm too angry. Then they get  told they're too sensitive. I hate that I'm too sensitive. So gradually piece by piece of their  personality, they develop a greater negativity towards it. So now they hate their body. They hate  their personality. They hate their emotions. They hate their skills. And they're trying to hide more  and more of themself and replace it with a mass that they think will gain them acceptance.  But there's more and more of themself that they don't like. So shame just has grown gradually through  childhood. But also the internal parent has found more and more things to be negative about in  themself. And that is what has happened inside a child. What is so important to understand moving forward  is there have been a whole bunch of tests that have been done to basically figure out what is it that  is the best long lasting motivation that brings about long lasting change in growth in people.  For people from complex trauma, they thought it would be critical shame the person. And what they  found is that that brought about some short term improvement. But if they kept getting criticized,  if they kept getting shamed after a while, it actually made things worse. The child gave up growing,  they felt hopeless. What brought about long lasting growth and healing and change self-compassion?  What I want you to understand is what is actually needed to grow is the exact opposite remedy  that shame has produced. Shame has produced shame and criticize and be hard on yourself. When the  actual remedy, the actual healthy solution is be kind to yourself. To a person who's always been  hard on themself, that feels wrong. That feels weak. That feels like how can that produce any good  results. So you have to work through what feels very wrong, it feels weird, it feels awkward,  it feels like you're being soft, but that is the path to healing. The next one, and that is shame  basically says I don't have value. So I don't want to feel that way. I want to feel valued. I want  others to value me. So I must gain value somehow. I don't feel I have it inherently. I must earn it.  I must gain it through externals. So let me show how this develops with shame. So what a child  then will do is look for ways that cause them to feel they have value. So they compare themselves to  others. And they find kind of an arena where they seem to compete better based on kind of what  culture values. So if they're very pretty, and they go, wow, I'm prettier than everybody in this class  and culture values prettiness, then that's what gives me value is my prettiness. And then if they get  validated from others that, wow, you're pretty, then they go the whole basis of my value now is my  prettiness, my beauty. Or then as they develop my body, or how good I am in bed, my ability sexually,  that's what gives me value. Or my brains, I'm smarter than everybody. I get awards, I get recognized.  So everything is on my ability to use my brains. That's what gives me value. Or I am very talented in  sports. I'm very talented in music. I'm very talented in acting. So everybody's validating that  they're respecting me because of my talent. So my talent is what gives me value. Or my accomplishments,  I am a hard worker. I can produce a lot of positive things and accomplish a lot of stuff. And  people respect me for that and like me for that. So my accomplishments based on my constant hard work  is what gives me value. Or if I get positions where I have power, then I have value. So I need to  work towards significant positions. Or if I have lots of possessions, that must prove that I  significant. So I need big house, big car, lots of toys. That's what's going to give me possessions.  Or I'm going to be part of a culture or religion that says if you act a certain way that's proper,  that's sophisticated, that's spiritual, then you're going to get respected. Then you're going to be  better than everybody else. All of those it's trying to gain value and therefore solve shame.  Some people go to the other extreme and they go, well, I can't compete in the brains. I can't  compete in the body. I can't compete in the possessions. But I'm going to be the baddest of the bad.  And that's going to get me respect from certain people. That's where my value will come from.  So they're trying to solve shame by gaining all of their value through externals since they don't  feel they have anything internally. And it's all based on comparing themself with others. But  do you realize what comes out of that? What happens if a prettier girl comes to school?  Now I feel insecure. Now I see that person as the enemy as a threat. Now I must prove that I'm  prettier than them. Now I must put them down somehow to reestablish that I'm superior, my dominance.  Now I must always point out the flaws in others. It sets up an unsafe society.  It sets up a deep insecurity and always needing to prove something all the time.  The next thing that happens for a lot of children in complex trauma is they head down a direction  of gaining value based on the first thing that their parents or relatives or friends validated about  them. So if they were told they were funny. Oh, you're so funny. All of a sudden they're heading down  that road. And that's my sense of value. That's where it comes from. So I'm going to be the funniest  around. I'm going to be funny all the time. Or if they got told you're so pretty. And that was  constantly the focus every time people met them. Wow, you're so pretty. Then that became the focus  of their life. Then other children every time they help somebody. Oh, you're such a helpful person.  And then the people that they helped they go, oh, thank you so much. You're such a wonderful person.  And so now their value comes from helping people. Others, you're so sacrificing. You're always giving.  You never make demands. You never express your needs. You never push. You just give, give, give.  Wow, you are just a saint. They go, wow, okay, then I'm going to never have needs. I'm just going to  give and sacrifice constantly because that's what gives me my value. Or others, all of a sudden  seem to realize that they gain value every time they were sick. So mom and dad neglected them normally.  But when they were sick or they had a problem, mom and dad came rushing in gave them all kinds of  attention. All of a sudden they were super valuable. So if they're in pain, if they're sick, if they're  in need, that's the way to gain value. Many as soon as they got a job, then they got status. They got  money. They got recognition. People noticed them. So their whole value came from their career.  Problem is when they lose their career, when they retire, then who am I? Where does my value come from?  So what comes out of all of these things, what I'm wanting you to see is in a healthy home,  a child is able to be a human being. Their value comes from just being. It's inherent.  Complex trauma, you have to become a human doer. All your value comes from externals by you doing  something. That is the wrong way to approach value. But that is what they think is their only option.  Let me add a couple others. Some people lived with shame for so long and then they become a parent.  And all of a sudden they have a little life that adores them, a little life that wants them,  a little life that they feel such love for. They realize this child is totally dependent on them  and that gives them a sense of value. And so the solution in their brain is I need to be a parent.  I always have to have my child dependent on me. I need to create a relationship with my child  where they're not actually allowed to grow up and become independent of me. They always need to  depend on me in some way. And then others, they just go, I need validation. I need others to notice me.  That will give me a sense of some value. So they begin to pursue the spotlight to try to get  others to notice them. They begin to tell sensational stories. They, whenever anybody shares something  with them, they share a one-up story to try to look a little bit more impressive than everybody else.  They tell you regularly about all of their accomplishments. Just hoping people will go, wow,  you're impressive. They're longing for value. Let me add one final one that comes out of shame. And  that is, they isolate and build walls. So the ultimate way to hide shame, to hide my authentic self  is to isolate. But to understand isolation, there's geographic isolation and there's internal isolation  through building walls around your heart. So some people go to geographical isolation. They withdraw  from people. They convince themselves that they don't need anybody. And they kind of live all by  themselves alone, self-sufficient, and really don't have relationships. So some go that route.  But most, they go to building walls around their heart. And these can be people who have tons of  superficial friends. They're very sociable. They can be the life of the party. They're just  constantly surrounded by people. But nobody's getting close to them. Nobody's going to get to know the  real them. They're not going to reveal who they really are to anybody. They're going to let people  know them to a degree. But then there, that was people are going to bump into a wall. Those people  are going to try to get to know them better, but aren't going to be able to do that.  So let me take this back to develop it a little bit farther. Because there's another piece that  happens with this isolation. So in complex trauma, one way to understand it is the child is desperately  trying to connect with mom and dad. But for some reason, they can't have secure attachment with mom and  dad mom and dad neglect them abuse them. They're too busy. So there's insecure attachment.  The child concludes it's my fault. So shame develops. The child then says I must hide my authentic  self. I must isolate from people because I'm bad. Anybody gets to know me. He's going to reject me.  So I'm going to prevent that from happening by just isolating from people. That's going to be the  best way to hide. But what then is happening inside the child because of shame is I don't even want  a relationship with myself. So it's not just about me avoiding relationships with others and isolating  from them. I don't even like me. So I'm going to isolate from myself. I'm going to abandon myself. So  mom and dad kind of abandoned me. That's what it felt like because they didn't want to connect with  me. So if they didn't want to connect with me and abandon me, well, I'm going to abandon myself.  And so there's this self-abendiment that begins to happen. And as a result of that,  is there's a deep loneliness that sets in. A deep feeling of not belonging, of not fitting in.  So these people can be in a crowd where everybody's laughing at their stories, but they don't feel they  belong. They feel very alone. And what happens for so many people with that is it leads to addiction.  There's such a deep emptiness, a deep loneliness. They have to medicated. They have to try to fill it with  something that makes them feel a little bit better. And so it leads to addiction, but it leads to  from any to deep depression, to mental health issues because they've abandoned themselves. There's  a deep, deep loneliness. So what I want you to see is this isolation, this deep loneliness is really  about deep shame that came out of lack of connection. The brain was trying to protect the child from  getting hurt. And so what it thought was just isolate. That's the best way to protect the child,  but it actually made things worse. What you have to understand is the brain was trying to protect the  child from unsafe people. To continue to live in isolation is hurting you. What you are trying to  protect yourself from is unsafe people. But what you need is connection with safe people, but your  brain fears anybody I try to connect with, I'm going to get hurt. And what you have to fight against  is I need connection. It's a key factor to my healing, to a healthy meaningful life. I have to find  safe people. It's going to get scary because I'm going to be afraid this can play out like it  always has, but it always was unsafe people. So with safe people, it should be a different outcome. I  have to trust that even though I'm feeling fear. If I stay in continued isolation, it's just going  to lead me to darker and darker places. So those are some of the characteristics that come out of  complex trauma. Next time we'll look at a bunch more characteristics that come out of complex trauma  and shame. Thank you.
