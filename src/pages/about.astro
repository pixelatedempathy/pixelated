          What We Actually Built

        <p class="mt-6 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
          <strong>Pixelated Empathy</strong> is an enterprise-grade AI training simulator that one self-taught developer 
          built entirely in secret. While other "startups" were raising millions and hiring teams, we were quietly building 
          the most sophisticated therapy training platform that exists. Now it's ready. Now we're talking.

            The Problem We're Solving
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            Mental health training is fundamentally broken. Students practice on maybe a dozen carefully selected, 
            "manageable" cases during their entire education. Then they graduate and meet their first client with 
            severe trauma, cultural complexity, or active suicidality. And panic. We built the thing that should 
            have existed decades ago: unlimited practice with the hardest cases, completely safely.

            Who This Is For
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            Universities that are tired of graduating therapists who freeze up at their first difficult case. 
            Clinics that want competency-based hiring instead of hoping for the best. Individual practitioners 
            who know they need more practice but can't risk experimenting on real humans. Anyone who believes 
            mental health professionals deserve better training than "good luck, figure it out."

            About The Company
          </h3>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            <strong>Pixelated Empathy</strong> was founded in 2025 by Chad, a self-taught developer with deep experience in both software engineering and mental health. 
            The entire platform was built in stealth mode over multiple years to protect the innovation and perfect the technology before revealing it to the world. 
            We're not your typical "move fast and break things" startup. We moved deliberately and built something that actually works.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            <strong>Current Stage:</strong> The platform is built, tested, and ready for deployment. We're now emerging from stealth mode to begin partnerships 
            with forward-thinking institutions who understand that mental health training needs a revolution, not an evolution.
          </p>
          <p class="mt-4 text-lg leading-8 text-gray-300">
            <strong>Why Now:</strong> Because we're finally confident enough in what we've built to put it in front of the people who matter most: 
            the educators, clinicians, and students who will use it to become better therapists. 
            Time to prove that one determined person can build enterprise-grade AI when they refuse to accept "impossible."
