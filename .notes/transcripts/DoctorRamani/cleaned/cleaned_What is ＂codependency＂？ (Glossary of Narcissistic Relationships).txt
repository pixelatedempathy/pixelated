Hi everyone, it's Dr.  Ramani and welcome back to this series that's sort of like a glossary or a handbook of the kinds of terminology that comes up when we are talking about narcissism and narcissistic relationships.  And these terms come up in blogs and in videos and many times people are not fully sure what they mean.  My hope is to create some clarity there.

But there also may be terms here that may just be brand new to you and may be a place for you to understand some of the patterns in your narcissistic relationship.  Today we are going to take on the term codependency.

But before I go on to that please hit the button that says subscribe and also hit the bell.  That way you will not only be a subscriber to this channel and get notifications regularly about the content coming out on this channel, but also give you a chance to look at all the other stuff that I have there on my channel.

Now, let's get started.  So I have got some things here that I am going to talk about today.  I am going to talk about the term codependency.  And what I am going to talk about today is the term codependency.  So I am going to talk about the term codependency.  And what I am going to talk about today is the term codependency.  And what I am going to talk about today is the term codependency.  And what I am going to talk about today is the term non-narcissism.  So let's talk about codependency.  Now what's interesting is that this is the video in this glossary series that I almost did not make.  It's a risky term and a problematic one in terms of how when we talk about it in regard to narcissistic abuse.  And it runs the risk of blaming the person who finds himself or herself in the narcissistic relationship.  And I am going to talk about that now.  So let's get started.  I thought about it for a while and because it comes up so much when people are talking about narcissistic relationship, I believe that at a minimum, let's talk about it in this series with regard to narcissism and narcissistic abuse.  So anyone who is listening to this whole series gets a full picture of the kinds of words and terms that are used, gets a fuller understanding of the terminology used in this world and perhaps, I would love, if you want to drop a comment, would love to hear you and what your thoughts and let you weigh in about this debate, about how this term fits into the realm of understanding narcissistic relationships.  The struggle that comes up with the term codependency is that this term is so nonspecific and poorly defined that it ends up taking in a lot of territory, including a person who is in a search.  Their associates.  So every single person you talk to often calls the term codependency, I think it has a different meaning.  Who's a rescuer, who might be termed dependent or needy or indecisive.  In 1986, Tim and Cermak published a list of criteria he wanted to have included in the DSM as a formal diagnosis of codependency as a personality disorder.  Now obviously that never happened, but in the article he had laying all this out, he laid out the criteria.  Basically he highlighted the dynamic of the codependent person as a person who gets their self-esteem in part through enduring an unhealthy relationship and they keep other people stuck in that relationship too, classically in a family relationship, and they do this even though it is hurting everyone.  In Cermak's definition it came down to the following.  It came down to putting the needs of other people ahead of the codependent person's own needs.  He also highlighted the anxieties that arise from separation in the codependent dynamic.  There's also the process of enmeshment that we see in codependent relationships, which is really just a very, very tangled boundaries and an unwillingness to draw appropriate boundaries, especially with people who are on a particular level of certain kinds of psychiatric and psychological disorders, substance use disorders and personality disorders most specifically.  Now Cermak also highlighted patterns, including denial, holding back emotions, depression, hypervigilance, which hypervigilance is sort of always being on edge and jumping and chronically monitoring your environment for threats.  Other things include compulsive behavior and anxiety.  He also speaks to some of the risks we observe for a person as a codependent pattern and he will highlight a history of physical or sexual abuse that often appears in a codependent person's life and that a person who's experiencing codependency may also be experiencing stress related physical illnesses.  These could be things like chronic headaches or autoimmune flare-ups.  And finally in his definition the codependent person does not seek help.  The overall picture here is of someone who is stuck in a very victimized situation and is not only not trying to get out but is basically clipping their own wings and staying in it.  The presumption, at least my read on it, is that the codependent person is aware of the risks that they are experiencing and that they are not trying to get out of it.  So he's not trying to get out of it.  He's not trying to get out of it.  He's not trying to get out of it.  He's not trying to get out of it.  He's not trying to get out of it.  So in this case, the codependent person is aware that their partner is a substance user or has very toxic, difficult kinds of patterns and behaviors.

But they will minimize those issues.  Ultimately, however, the codependent personality in some ways gets their self-esteem by the sense that they can somehow control the behavior of someone else in their life.  So in the case of substance abuse or alcohol, it's when their partner, for example, or someone else in the family is not drinking.  So their self-esteem gets completely linked to someone else's behavior.  And that, in fact, is something that they cannot control.  So it's a very risky place to get your self-esteem from.  Now there are some members who believe that narcissistic relationships largely remain in place because the partners are codependent enablers.  Who participate in the toxic spiral because the narcissist feeds their vulnerabilities while the codependent partner keeps providing narcissistic supply.  Now it's a little bit risky to view it through this lens because personally I think it misses some key issues.  Now well before Dr.  Cermak put his definition out there, codependency was a term that originated in the clinical literature that focused on addiction.  And a lot of its earlier origins come out of the language of 12-step programs such as Alcoholics Anonymous.  It was believed that the family members of an addict, of a substance abuser, could actually make things worse.  By over helping the addict or over giving to them, in essence, enabling the addict's substance abuse by not drawing the painful boundaries.  This whole terminology of codependency describes a family system that's often characterized by patterns such as denial, lack of communication, and again going back to Cermak's definition, a restricted expression of emotions.  So overall.  When we look at the range of definitions on codependency, codependent individuals are often observed to deny their own healthy needs.  And they attempt to save or rescue the problem person in the family system.  For example, the alcoholic.  Whether by denying the problem or by repeatedly rescuing them with caregiving or money or other resources.  Now definitions of codependency have since broadened beyond addiction to take in other kinds of problematic, difficult relationships including just generally difficult family dynamics.  Family dynamics that center around abuse as well as relationships associated with other mental illnesses and personality dynamics.

But the general idea is that one parent.  Or other adult family members.  Just keep sticking it out with the toxic person despite the harm it is bringing to everyone.  Namely, their children.  Now in my experience of working with hundreds of people in these family situations, I have to say that I have observed that being raised in an invalidating family can absolutely create the risk of a person's life being affected.  And that is the most common dynamic in these families.  Because maybe if you were enough, someone in your family system would have had your back.  Or maybe the invalidating things you are regularly told were true because no one had your back and advocated for you and they would have if you were enough.  Over time a child for no other reason than for survival may also have a very strong sense of self-esteem.  And that is the most common dynamic in these families.  Some of these children, at the age of 23 through 27 may also participate in denying the problems within the family.  You know what it is, everything is fine.  Our family is great.  Everything is fine.  In their adult relationships people from invalidating family systems may then transition into playing the role of being the rescuer and the caregiver to other people with the goal, especially in romantic relationships, with the goal of winning over his or her unwinnable partner.  So just about all of the families of each class are in the middle of a szczeg√≥l or due to one another sixteen year break from a single sister.  And had she or he not followed the rules at all?  He or she has sinned in a sexual or sexual toy.  Partner.  This is all a replay of trying to win over the unwinnable parent.  Interestingly, even though a person could grow up in a family system that played out this, again, codependent dynamic, they may actually remain blind to it and not recognize it in their adult relationships.  Instead of questioning the unhealthy dynamic, they accept it because it is all they know.  And honestly, it would probably be too destabilizing to question it.  Becoming educated about the pattern and also being educated about the revelation that these patterns are not likely to change much do rally many people out there out of their blindness to these patterns and can awaken people to make a change.

But the risk of just dismissing these patterns in narcissistic relationships as largely codependent and just simply casting the person in a narcissistic relationship in the role of being an enabler or solely as a victim that is complicit in their own abuse, that can often set a precedent that pathologizes a person for simply wanting to make a relationship change.  That does not necessarily stop these events.  Self- Massachusetts increasing social Gingerly abuse tuo relationship, I am struck by how many people, once they are educated about narcissism, can actually become quite decisive and get out or at least set very different boundaries.  Now do all people get out?  No.  And perhaps that dynamic, the people who will not get out and just keep staying and staying and hurting themselves in that space, maybe that's more of the codependent dynamic.

But the risk of just simply blanket using the codependent term to understand why people get caught in narcissistic relationships can often render the people who are in these relationships as becoming almost like feeling that they are powerless.  Like I am a codependent so this is just how it is.  And in fact they are not that powerless because they just do not know.

But the fact is that the dynamic raised by the definitions of codependency that we have put out there definitely have parallels.  There are parallels that we cannot ignore, the narcissistic relationship and the codependent relationship.  We know that narcissistic relationships are characterized by the denial of your own needs.  Because honestly it's protective.  At some level you know that your needs are not going to be met within this relationship.  They are also characterized by anxiety when the discarding phase begins.  Denial about what is really happening in the relationship.  Saying things like, but we do have good days.  Hyper vigilance because you do not know when that narcissist is going to have that injury and fly into a rage.  Stress that can culminate into physical and significant mental health issues.  And here is where it gets even more bleak.  One of the issues that often comes up in codependent relationships is this idea of constriction of emotions.  Meaning that the codependent person does not feel safe or at times even able to share their emotions.  And yet we know that sharing those emotions is dangerous and it's invalidating.  So the question is, does that emotional constriction, that holding back on sharing your emotions, does that happen in other places in the person's life?  Some people.  Some people who are stuck in narcissistic relationships have learned how to be very judicious and they have learned to not share their emotions with the narcissist in their life but have a full and beautiful range of emotions with other people who are safe and healthy and loving.  So it's not like they are constricted everywhere.  We know that codependency is a cycle that can span a person's lifetime.  Okay.  And there are some people who have a very strong emotional connection to their partner, but they do not always have a strong emotional connection to their partner.  They may have a codependent family of origin.  And that could be due to many issues.  That could be due to alcoholism, other addictions, or narcissism and other high conflict personality styles in that codependent family of origin.  And what this can do is that this can set up a vulnerability going into adulthood.

But that vulnerability is not a destiny.  It's not a guarantee.  Plenty of people break out of codependency.  It's a perfect example of codependent family systems.  And some people actually find the origins of their codependent cycles did not start in childhood.  They actually show up in their adult relationships, especially if their adult relationship is with a substance abuser or a person with a high conflict personality style such as narcissism.  And this codependent style may cut across all of a person's relationships.  It could be a cycle.  You replicate in not only romantic relationships but friendships, work relationships, you name it.  And given that there are often traumatic origins and codependent cycles, and much of this cycle and these patterns mirror the trauma bonding cycle, which is also covered in this series, to push back on a codependent pattern, trauma-focused therapies become essential.

But I am going to come back to this.  I am going to come back to this.  I am going to come back to my original premise.  I do believe, I do believe that a certain percentage of narcissistic relationship dynamics do reflect codependency, but not all of them.  I believe that there is a substantial subset for whom education about these cycles, namely that narcissistic individuals are not going to change, and that they are indeed classical cycles that kind of play out the same way for most people, that you do not need to personalize these cycles.  When people know that, it tends to set many people free.  Only you know if this term fits you or someone you know.  So the term codependency often aligns with the trauma bonding cycle and is often a part of, a big part of the discourse about narcissistic relationships.  Now.  I think it is much more complex and is not always a given that codependency is exactly what's happening.  So before you, if you are in a narcissistic relationship, before you just wrap yourself in the label of codependency, I want you to really reflect on your patterns.  Many people who stay in narcissistic relationships are not in denial.  They know exactly what they are dealing with.

But a variety of reasons.  I do not know, finances, court systems that do not get it, custody systems that do not get it, culture, religion, practical factors, they make an informed deal with the devil.  And they try to escape as soon as any of the strictures get released.  For example, the day all of their children are over the age of 18 or they are able to get secure employment, they get out.

But again, each story is very different.

But if indeed you have turned.  Your narcissistic relationship.  Your narcissistic relationship into a full-time job, that you are in denial about the damage that this relationship is incurring to you and others.  If you are managing false hopes and narratives, and especially if all of this is occurring against the backdrop of your own early life trauma, you know that that's part of your story, please, please consider therapy as a place to do that deep dive and explore these patterns.  Narcissism.  Narcissists persist because the world enables them.  It often starts with parents.  And then narcissistic patterns can also be enabled by school systems, by friends, by workplaces, by social media, by extended families, and by the world in general.  Our beloved narcissists get praised for their cool efficiency, their charm, their cool behavior, their cool behavior.  They are not just narcissists.  They are narcissists for their confidence and their success.  And sadly, there's often little regard for what kind of person they are.  And in that way, it's a little cynical, but in that way, perhaps all of us are a little codependent with the narcissistic people and systems around us.  Perhaps all of us do derive some level of self-esteem on the hope and the very, very hazy promise.  That maybe.  That we are going to be the one to master this other person.  Never ever link your self-esteem to another human being.  You are you.  A free standing unit.  You are embedded in lots of important systems, but your sense of self, your self-compassion, your self-worth, they all come from you.  Think about that when you think about codependency.  I hope this video clarified this term, this often confusing term, codependency for you.  And again, as always, I am going to say thank you.  I am going to say thank you.
