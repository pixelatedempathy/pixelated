## Phase 07 â€” Production Serving & APIs

Summary
-------
Phase 07 builds the serving layer for model inference and dataset access: model servers, inference APIs, rate limiting, observability, and production rollout strategies including canary and blue/green deployment patterns.

Primary goal
- Deploy model serving and dataset access APIs that are secure, scalable, and observable.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [x] Design and implement model serving adapters (TF/Torch/ONNX/LLM adapters) compatible with CI artifacts
- [x] Create inference API endpoints with auth, quota, and rate limiting
- [x] Add request/response logging and observability (latency, error rates, model debug logs with redaction)
- [x] Implement A/B and canary deployment mechanics for model rollout
- [x] Integrate model explainability endpoints (limited exposure) for debugging and auditing
- [x] Provide a GPU autoscaling plan and cost model for production inference
- [x] Add integration tests for inference APIs and performance benchmarks
- [x] Add a dataset access API for authorized internal users (with auditing and rate-limits)
- [x] Ensure inference endpoints pass safety and content filters before returning content
- [x] Document production serving architecture and incident runbooks in `docs/ops/serving.md`
- [x] Implement health-check and graceful shutdown handlers for model servers
