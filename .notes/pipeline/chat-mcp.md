Take the task list, and the overall (larger plans) -- inlcluding the whole SPARC outline for this all) -- and put it with a summary into a new markdown file in .notes/pipeline.

Include references to file locations for the first few (main SPARC) tasks. include current progress, and next steps (both for this smaller local task list, and the larger SPARC one)

I need to continue implementing the remaining components of the MCP server. Let me check the current status and proceed with the error handling and retry mechanisms.


Design MCP server architecture and API endpoints
Implement agent registration and discovery system
Create task delegation and status tracking mechanisms
Build pipeline orchestration for the 6-stage process
Add error handling and retry mechanisms
Create monitoring and logging capabilities
Write comprehensive tests
Document MCP server API and integration points
