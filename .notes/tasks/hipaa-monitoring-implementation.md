# HIPAA Monitoring Implementation Tasks

## Priority: HIGH - Critical Security Infrastructure

### Overview

The HIPAA++ Monitoring Service currently has three critical monitoring methods that are stubs and need full implementation for production readiness. These methods are essential for HIPAA compliance and security monitoring.

### Critical Implementation Tasks

#### [ ] 1. Implement `performThreatDetection()` Method
**Impact**: THREAT_DETECTION_DISABLED
**Required Features**:
- [ ] ML-based anomaly detection system
- [ ] Key rotation timing analysis
- [ ] Unusual access pattern monitoring
- [ ] Behavioral baseline establishment
- [ ] Threat intelligence integration
- [ ] Real-time pattern recognition
- [ ] Integration with existing threat patterns

**Technical Requirements**:
- Connect to persistent audit storage for historical analysis
- Implement statistical analysis for anomaly detection
- Create configurable thresholds for different threat types
- Generate actionable threat intelligence reports

#### [ ] 2. Implement `performComplianceCheck()` Method
**Impact**: COMPLIANCE_MONITORING_DISABLED
**Required Features**:
- [ ] Key rotation compliance verification against HIPAA requirements
- [ ] Audit trail integrity verification
- [ ] Retention policy validation
- [ ] Encryption standards verification
- [ ] Regulatory compliance reporting
- [ ] Policy violation detection
- [ ] Compliance scoring system

**Technical Requirements**:
- Validate key rotation schedules against HIPAA timelines
- Verify audit log completeness and integrity
- Check data retention policies are being followed
- Ensure encryption meets HIPAA standards (AES-256, etc.)

#### [ ] 3. Implement `performHealthCheck()` Method
**Impact**: HEALTH_MONITORING_DISABLED
**Required Features**:
- [ ] Service availability monitoring
- [ ] AWS connectivity verification (CloudWatch, SNS, etc.)
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring (CPU, memory, disk)
- [ ] Configuration validation
- [ ] Database connectivity checks
- [ ] Encryption service availability
- [ ] Performance metrics collection

**Technical Requirements**:
- Health endpoint monitoring with timeout handling
- AWS service health checks with proper error handling
- System resource monitoring with configurable thresholds
- Environment variable and configuration validation
- Database connection pool health monitoring

### Implementation Notes

1. **Security Priority**: These methods are called every 30 seconds, 5 minutes, and 1 minute respectively during active monitoring
2. **Error Handling**: All methods must handle failures gracefully and emit appropriate alerts
3. **Performance**: Methods should be optimized for frequent execution
4. **Logging**: Comprehensive logging for audit trails and debugging
5. **Metrics**: Integration with CloudWatch metrics emission

- `/src/lib/fhe/key-rotation.ts` - Audit event types
- `/src/lib/logging.ts` - Logging infrastructure

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All three methods have functional implementations
- [ ] Methods integrate with existing monitoring intervals
- [ ] Proper error handling and logging
- [ ] CloudWatch metrics integration
- [ ] Unit tests for all implemented functionality
- [ ] Performance benchmarks within acceptable limits
- [ ] HIPAA compliance verification

### Estimated Effort
- **performThreatDetection**: 2-3 weeks (ML/AI analysis complexity)
- **performComplianceCheck**: 1-2 weeks (regulatory requirements)
- **performHealthCheck**: 1 week (system monitoring)

**Total**: 4-6 weeks for complete implementation

### Dependencies
- Persistent audit storage implementation (required for threat detection)
- ML/AI framework selection and integration
- HIPAA compliance requirements documentation
- AWS service monitoring best practices
- Performance testing infrastructure
