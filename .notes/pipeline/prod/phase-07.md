## Phase 07 â€” Production Serving & APIs

Summary
-------
This phase builds the serving layer for model inference and dataset access: model servers, inference APIs, rate limiting, observability, and production rollout strategies including canary and blue/green deployment patterns.

Primary goal
- Deploy model serving and dataset access APIs that are secure, scalable, and observable.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Design and implement model serving adapters (TF/Torch/ONNX/LLM adapters) compatible with CI artifacts
- [ ] Create inference API endpoints with auth, quota, and rate limiting
- [ ] Add request/response logging and observability (latency, error rates, model debug logs with redaction)
- [ ] Implement A/B and canary deployment mechanics for model rollout
- [ ] Integrate model explainability endpoints (limited exposure) for debugging and auditing
- [ ] Provide a GPU autoscaling plan and cost model for production inference
- [ ] Add integration tests for inference APIs and performance benchmarks
- [ ] Add a dataset access API for authorized internal users (with auditing and rate-limits)
- [ ] Ensure inference endpoints pass safety and content filters before returning content
- [ ] Document production serving architecture and incident runbooks in `docs/ops/serving.md`
- [ ] Implement health-check and graceful shutdown handlers for model servers
