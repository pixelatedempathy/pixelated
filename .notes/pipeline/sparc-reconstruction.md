### Phase 3: Pipeline Communication ✅
- Six-stage pipeline coordination implemented
- Inter-service communication established
- File locations: `src/lib/pipeline/`, `api/pipeline/`

### Phase 4: Web Frontend Integration ✅
- React/Astro components implemented
- UI integration with backend services
- File locations: `src/components/`, `src/pages/`

### Phase 5: CLI Interface ✅

- CLI commands and utilities
- File locations: `scripts/`, `cli/`

## Current Phase 6: MCP Server (In Progress)

### SPARC Tasks for Phase 6

#### Specification (S)
- Design MCP (Management Control Panel) server architecture
- Define agent interaction endpoints and protocols
- Specify authentication and authorization requirements
- Establish error handling and retry mechanisms
- Define monitoring and logging requirements

#### Pseudocode (P)
- Agent registration and discovery flow
- Task delegation and status tracking logic
- Pipeline orchestration for 6-stage process
- Authentication and authorization flow
- Error handling and retry logic

#### Architecture (A)
- MCP server service boundaries
- API endpoint design (RESTful + WebSocket)
- Database schema for agent management
- Integration with existing Flask service
- Security and authentication architecture

#### Refinement (R)
- Implement agent registration system
- Create task delegation mechanisms
- Build pipeline orchestration
- Add authentication and authorization
- Implement error handling and retry logic
- Add monitoring and logging
- Write comprehensive tests

#### Completion (C)
- Integration testing with existing services
- Performance optimization
- Documentation completion
- Deployment configuration
- Monitoring setup

## Remaining Phases (7-10)

### Phase 7: Authentication & Security (Not Started)
- JWT implementation
- Rate limiting
- Security hardening

### Phase 8: Progress Tracking (Not Started)
- WebSocket integration
- Redis caching
- Real-time updates

### Phase 9: Testing Suite (Not Started)
- Unit tests
- Integration tests
- End-to-end tests

### Phase 10: Integration & Deployment (Not Started)
- Final assembly
- Production deployment
- Monitoring setup

## Current Task List (Phase 6 MCP Server)

1. **Design MCP server architecture and API endpoints**
2. **Implement agent registration and discovery system**
3. **Create task delegation and status tracking mechanisms**
4. **Build pipeline orchestration for the 6-stage process**
5. **Implement authentication and authorization for agent access**
6. **Add error handling and retry mechanisms**
7. **Create monitoring and logging capabilities**
8. **Write comprehensive tests**
9. **Document MCP server API and integration points**

## Next Steps

1. Switch to SPARC orchestrator mode
2. Delegate architecture design to architect mode
3. Implement MCP server components systematically
4. Ensure integration with existing Flask service
5. Follow project patterns and maintain compatibility
