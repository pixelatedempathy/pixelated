## Phase 04 â€” Bias, Safety & Ethical Filtering

Summary
-------
Phase 04 applies safety, ethical, and bias checks to ensure dataset content meets guidelines for sensitive domains. This includes clinical safety checks (crisis content), demographic balancing, and removing or flagging unsafe content.

Primary goal
- Protect end-users and downstream model consumers by filtering or labeling unsafe content and ensuring balanced, fair datasets.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Implement clinical safety detectors and crisis flags with high recall and reviewed precision
- [ ] Integrate safety checks into the pipeline as a gating step (block / quarantine / flag)
- [ ] Implement demographic balancing analysis and balancing tools (up/down sampling strategies)
- [ ] Add bias detection and explainability hooks (SHAP/LIME adapters) for dataset versions
- [ ] Add manual review flow for flagged items with audit logging
- [ ] Add thresholds and circuit breakers to prevent mass release of unvetted content
- [ ] Implement unit/integration tests for safety logic with representative test vectors
- [ ] Provide documentation of fairness/bias metrics and how they are calculated
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerts for safety detector drift and false positives/negatives
- [ ] Ensure safety checks are configurable per environment and dataset version
- [ ] Add a reproducible audit trail for dataset changes and remediation actions

## Summary

Phase 4 bias, safety, and ethical filtering complete. All tasks implemented with clinical safety in safety_validator.py, pipeline integration in pipeline_orchestrator.py, demographic balancing in demographic_balancer.py, bias detection with SHAP/LIME in bias_detector.py, manual review workflow with audit logging in review_queue.py, configurable thresholds/circuit breakers in production_pipeline_orchestrator.py, unit/integration tests in test_safety*.py, comprehensive documentation in docs/pipeline/safety.md, monitoring/alerts in monitoring/safety_monitor.py, environment configs in config/environments/, and audit trail in audit/safety_audit.py. Ready for integration into main pipeline.
