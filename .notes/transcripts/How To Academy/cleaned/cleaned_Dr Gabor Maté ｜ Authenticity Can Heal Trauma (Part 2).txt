Tanya Cushman Reviewer Reviewer's Name Yes.  And those things that happen to you, I think you say at some point that all trauma is pre-verbal.  Trauma is something that you are quite careful in the book to say, look, it does not mean that you were run over or you were kidnapped.  That it's things like not being fed as a small child.  Not being responded to, yes.  Yes.  And you then take that idea of trauma being something that can happen to a very young child and you say, before our minds can make the world, that we make the world that we then live in, you said, but before that happens, the world makes our minds.  Yes.  And it's those early experiences, for you, are those the things then that you could classify as traumas?  That they become embedded in the child and manifest them later in life as something?  That's right.  How does that happen?  How does it get embedded?  Yes, well, first of all, what sort of things are they?  And then why do they get embedded?  So trauma basically means a wound.  So trauma is when you are wounded and that wound persists and has impact in your life later on.  So trauma, this is important to distinguish.  Trauma is not what happens to you.  Trauma is what happens inside you as a result of what happens to you.  So I just came back from Budapest.  I was there presenting this book on Hungarian.  And this is, I do not know who designed this, but I went, you know, one of the things that I have to do every day is swim.  You do not want to talk to me if I have not swum, you know.  And I swam this morning already.  It's okay.  So in Budapest, I was staying at a hotel, and around the corner there's a swim club where I go swimming every morning.  Across the street, directly across the street, as far from us as, say, the second row here, is the building where my mother and I lived when I was 11 months old, and I nearly died there.  And she gave me to a stranger in the street on the same paving stones that are still there.  And so I did not see her for five or six weeks.  A lot of people know this story.  The trauma was not that she gave me to a stranger.  The trauma is what I made it mean.  Now any child, what can a child make it mean except that I am being abandoned?  And who gets abandoned?  Somebody who's not lovable.  Somebody who's not wanted.  So the trauma then is my sense of not being wanted, and not being lovable, not being considered important enough.  Now that trauma plays itself out for decades afterwards.  So it's not what happened to me as such.  Because when you look at it objectively, what happened to me as such was that my mother gave me to a stranger, and the stranger took me.  Those are both huge acts of love, actually.  That's the universe loving this child to take care of it.

But that does not matter.  It's what I make it mean.  So the wound is then what happens within us.  That gets embedded in the nervous system as emotional memory, not as recollection.  I do not recall being given to a stranger by my mother, because the parts of the brain that recall are not even online at that age yet.  It does not come online until years later.

But the emotional memory of being hurt and being abandoned and not being wanted, that's embedded in the nervous system.  And then it gets triggered whenever anything even vaguely resembling it later on, decades later, shows up.  In fact, if you look at the expression being triggered, it's a really interesting expression.  These days, we are, you know, trigger warning, you know.  Do not you trigger me.  Well, here's the thing.  What can be triggered?  For a trigger to do anything, a trigger is a very small little thing.  For a trigger to have any impact whatsoever, there has to be an ammunition there.  There has to be explosive charge.  So when I get triggered, it's not because somebody did something.  It's because what they did happened to set off the explosion.  And that explosive charge, the emotional baggage that I am carrying.  So if I carry the emotional baggage of somebody who does not have a sense of being wanted and being important, anything later on that reminds me of that will trigger me and drive my behavior.  So that's how trauma works.  It's embedded in the nervous system, in the brain, in the form of emotional subverbal memory.  Nothing you.  By the way, I am sorry to say, one more thing.  It's also embedded in the body.  So many of you will have had the experience, or if you are a body worker, like a massage therapist, you go to a massage therapist, they touch you in a certain part of the body, and all of a sudden you are overwhelmed by emotion.  You have had that experience?  So that's the body.  As Bessel says, Bessel van der Kolk, the body keeps the score.  So the trauma is embedded also in the muscles and in the connective tissues and the nerves.  Also in the book you make the point that this word trauma, it's difficult to hear it in any way other than negative, but the point that you make in the book is that the thing, the story you tell yourself, or that your body takes in, is meant to help you at the time.  And is that why it gets retained?  That in its original form it's doing something positive, which later becomes.  That's a good point.  Tell us more about that, please.  Absolutely.  So.  Let's take somebody with a diagnosis of personality disorder, you know, borderline personality disorder, one of these diagnoses that do not explain anything.  They might describe something, but they do not explain anything, you know?  So one of the characteristics is that they do not trust people.  It's just hard for them to form relationships.  And they very easily feel hurt in a relationship.  Well, that's a perfectly normal defensive response to a child when you were hurt a lot.  You should not trust.  I mean, why would you want to trust?  How could you trust if you were always having a sense of being disappointed and even being betrayed?  So that what's called to be a pathological manifestation actually begins as a coping mechanism, and it's associated with your survival.  Or depression, you know, this disease, of depression, well, really?  What does it mean to depress something?  It means to push it down.

Now, what gets pushed down in depression is emotions.

But why would somebody push down their emotions?  Only because it was dangerous for them to express it, or unacceptable for them to express it.  In other words, they listened to a lot of parenting experts who tell people to tram, you know, to.  To.  To.  To.  To.  To.  To.  To.  To.  Suppress children's emotions if the emotions are not acceptable to the parents.  Then a child in order to survive will suppress their emotions, will depress them.  That's a survival technique associated with being accepted and being part of a family, which is something the child cannot do without.  Yes.  So once you associate something with survival, you are going to keep doing it, since it's unconscious.  It's not like you chose to do it.  It's just that, you know, this is how your organism survived, by depressing your emotions.  Now you are going to keep doing that.  In fact, you would be afraid not to.  And later on, you are diagnosed with this disease.

But it begins as a coping mechanism.  And there's so many others of these coping mechanisms that are associated with survival.  And therefore, we do not give them up.  Because if our survival depends on being a certain way, if that's what we learned, we are not going to give it up that easily.  Especially as you point out, children have very few options.  The ones that are built into us as mammals, it's fight, flight, or freeze.  Well, if you are a baby, you cannot fight.  And it's very difficult to run away.  So it does not leave you with much, does it?  Except, as you say, just to freeze and.  And it's that need for attention.  Attachment.  This is a word that you deal with a lot.  Tell us about attachment.  So this is a conflict that is probably central to my work in all manner of conditions.  And in all kinds of situations.  It's a very powerful dynamic in adult relationships, for example.  The child has an absolute need to belong to the parents and to be cared for by the parents.  That drive to be close to somebody, in order to be taken care of, or to take care of the other for that matter, is called attachment.  And mammals are creatures of attachment.  They cannot survive without attachment, without the caring relationship, obviously.  The young cannot survive.  So attachment, that's fine.

But then we have this other need that's also determined by evolution, which I call authenticity.  And just out of the self's authenticity, being in touch with ourselves, being in touch with our feelings and our bodies and our emotions.  I know last time I spoke here, I think I asked the same question, but let me do it again.  I think I did.  If you have had the experience of having a strong gut feeling about something, and ignoring it, and then being sorry afterwards, just raise your hand, okay?  I see the vast majority.  What you are telling me here is about your childhood.  Because gut feelings are essential for survival.  We evolved out there in nature.  For millions of years, the humanoid ancestors of our species lived out there in nature, as did our own species live out in nature for most of our existence as a species.  Like out of the 150,000, 200,000 years that Homo sapiens has walked the Earth, if that can be represented in one hour, then until about five minutes ago, we lived out there in nature.  How long does any creature in nature survive if they are not in touch with their gut feelings?  So that being in touch with our bodies and our emotions is essential also.  Terrific.

But what happens is that for the sake of fitting with the family, or with a culture that does not particularly support our authenticity, we have to give up our connection to ourselves, our authenticity, for the sake of attachment.  Then, being inauthentic, being out of touch with ourselves, is how we survive.  We are afraid to be ourselves because we associate being ourselves with a threat of being rejected.  And so this means that for the rest of our lives, we are going to be in relationships where we are afraid to be ourselves to really say what it feels like for us.  Now that has terrific implications.  When I say terrific, I mean significant implications.  A study I quote in the book, they followed 2,000 women over 10 years.  Over a 10-year period, those women who were unhappily married and did not express their feelings were four times as likely to die as those women who were unhappily married, but they did talk about their feelings.  So that inauthenticity, which is not a moral judgment on my part, it's something people do in order to survive their childhoods, but that exacts a major cost in terms of physical and mental health.  Not to mention your relationships where you are afraid to be yourself, where you are in a relationship and you do not even.  Your partner does not even know you because you are afraid to be yourself.  So you feel alone even when you are partnered because if you are not known, you are going to feel alone.  It does not matter how many people surround you.  So the price that we pay for inauthenticity is huge, and yet so many of us survived our childhoods and when you put your hand up.  I mean, have you ever met a one-day-old baby that was not in touch with their gut feelings?  Oh, I am tired and I am hungry and I am uncomfortable and I am wet, but mom and dad are working so hard, I would better not.  I would better not cry.  You know, come on, you know?  In other words, when you put your hand up, something happened between the day you were born and a few years later.  When you no longer listened to your gut feelings because you could not afford to.  Something happened.  In a way, one of the things which comes across very strongly, especially in the early part of the book, is that we tend to think that children learn things when we teach them, when they get to school or when we can have a conversation with them.  And very strongly in the book, what comes across is that children become who they are and learn their first moral language, as it were, before any of that.  In other words, if you think that children, if you think to yourself, I shall wait until the child can speak and then I will teach them, it's too late.  They have already learned everything from what you did or did not do.  Yes, that's right.  So the.  And as a parent, because I was quite out of touch with myself and based on my own history, I was never comfortable playing with kids.  I kept thinking, well, once they learn language, because I am good at words, you see, so I thought once they learn language, then I will be able to.

But I missed the whole point.  It's that the real development happens before words even come along.  The emotional part of the brain, the holistic, you might say more feminine, although it's not gender determined at all, holistic, the emotional part of the brain, the right side of the brain, both in terms of the evolution of the species, but also in terms of the development of the individual.  The right side of the brain, the emotional brain develops first.  And it's the template for everything.  If we get the right side of the brain right, the left brain will follow very nicely.  If we do not get the right side of the brain, if we do not establish the emotional relationships which children require for healthy development, then they might become very intellectually developed on the left brain side, but they will be very underdeveloped.  There will not be a proper template for it.  And then they are going to be professors and all that kind of stuff, you know?  Or philosophers, I do not know.  Or medical doctors, so that in this culture, the left brain really rules.

But the left brain, divorced from a healthy emotional underpinning, where does it get us?  It gets us to where we are, which is we are the only species, we are the only species that creates environments that are destructive to its own species.  That's where the left brain has got us, because the right brain is underdeveloped.  And it cannot speak.  I mean, you cannot.  In some way, you do not have verbal access to the lessons, that first language you learned by the time you were six months old.  So how does that part of us speak to us when we will not listen?  It speaks to us through our.  See, here's the thing.  We think that we have this one brain up here, and what's a brain?  A brain interprets stimuli from the environment, processes them, and responds.  That's what a brain does.  So yes, we have this cerebrum up here, but there's also a.  It turns out there's a brain connected to the heart.  There's a nervous system that surrounds the heart, which is in communication with this brain here.  And of course, the gut has been called the second brain.  The gut is more.  It's more neurochemicals than the brain does in some ways.  And gut feelings are not luxuries, as we have demonstrated.  They are actually a form of knowledge.  So the gut is processing stimuli from the environment.  When these three brains are in sync with each other, then you have true wisdom.  Then you have true awareness.  When this one is unmoored from the other two, you can have all kinds of logic and all kinds of science and all kinds of technology, but you are not going to have wisdom.  Then you have a convalescent brain, and you are the one that will tell the brain that everything's okay and you can do whatever you want with it.  You have all the Logics, you have clarity, you have a dream.  That science is beyond reality.  You cannot do anything without it.  You cannot do anything if you have real protest and fiction as well.  That's the bottom.  Now the real science.  Yes, yes, yes, yes.
