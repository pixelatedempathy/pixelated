They always end up being so full of conflict that they break down and become unlivable.

Take that further.

Do you realize that the anxious person and the avoidant person or the chaser and the pursuer never learned how to connect in a healthy way?

So they are both emotionally unavailable.

So they don't even know if they stopped and said, let's do this healthy.

They don't know what healthy would look like because they don't know how to connect.

And so you want to know what the chaser says to the avoidant?

They're never emotionally available to me.

You want to know what the avoidant one says?

I'm afraid to talk to them because if I did, it wouldn't be about my stuff.

They'd be start talking about their stuff.

So I don't feel they're emotionally available either.

And so it breaks down over time.

It breaks down over and over again.

But sadly, it ends up validating the core belief that everybody that gets to know me will leave me because that is eventually what happens.

So what it ends up being is this cycle that keeps reinforcing the core belief of shame.

I'm not good enough.

Everybody that gets to know me will reject me and abandon me.

End of story.

End of story.

And so you're in this cycle and it keeps proving it to you, but you're afraid to leave that cycle.

So that leads me to my final question, and that is, okay, how do we change that?

So we spend a lot of time in recovery from trauma talking about the need for healthy connection.

And I don't want to take the time to go into detail on that.

We've done lots of other stuff about that.

But let me just say this tonight.

I think one of the hardest things to do in that is to find some safe people who are somewhat healthy.

And you go, where in the world do I look for that?

And I get asked that all the time.

But then there's a second, and it's probably even more difficult.

It's to go about a relationship very slowly.

So I'm not going to rush into this.

I'm going to very, very, very gradually, and by very, very, very gradually, I don't mean two weeks.

I mean six months to a year, get to watch a person, know them, without getting sold out to that person in an unhealthy way.

And over that time, I begin to see if there's red flags.

I begin to see if they're healthy.

I begin to see if there's even a chance of connecting.

And if they are healthy, you begin to gradually connect.

And as you connect, you can drop your mask, your guard, and you heal.

But it's a very slow, gradual process.

What makes it difficult for complex trauma is you think you have connection when you feel intensity.

You mistake connection for the feeling of intensity.

So that's why you like the intense relationships.

That's all limbic brain.

What you're wanting to do is realize connection happens gradually as you get to know a person who is safe and healthy.

And it's a very slow thing, often not having a whole bunch of feelings with it.

It's just the process of getting to know somebody.

What I want you to take away is the message of this second half is that God wants to attach with us.

So a lot of people, I think, when they come into recovery, in their mind, they just want to attach with a higher power.

But what I want you to be able to kind of take in is that ever since God created these things called human beings, He's wanted to connect with us.

And so as the song said, He's chasing us.

There's nothing that's going to get in the way of that.

So I want to give you a little different perspective.

So if you think of going on your first date, now most of you wouldn't think of going in your pajamas with your bed head happening and all of that.

When you go on your first date, you want to go so you're attractive to the other person.

Okay?

And then what you tend to do often consciously or maybe not even consciously is there are parts of you that are not even conscious.

There are parts of you that want to impress your date.

So that they go, wow, this person is great, not just hot.

They're great and I want a relationship with them.

Right?

So what God has done is how do I get people to want a relationship with me?

I want one with them.

How do I attract them to me?

So He does two things.

How do I make myself known?

The first one we know about and hear most often about is He revealed Himself through the writings of the Bible, what He is like.

But there's a second way and that is through creation.

So in Psalm 19 it says this, the heavens proclaim the glory of God.

And that word glory means the beauty of God.

It declares what God is like.

It puts on display how wonderful He is.

So it's the skies display His craftsmanship.

Day after day they continue to speak.

Now what it's saying is, is that the skies, the stars at night, the galaxies, nature is always speaking.

But then it says, without a word.

So they speak without a sound or a word.

Their voice is never heard.

Yet their message has gone through the earth and their words to all the world.

So only, not everybody is going to receive a Bible and read it.

But every single person that lives is going to see creation.

And so God is saying, I am putting myself on display for every single person.

Because they just got to look up into the stars at night.

They got to look at sunsets and mountains and oceans and all of that.

And they go, wow, there's something bigger than me.

There's something about how all of this works together.

That shows a wisdom that orchestrated it all and designed it all.

It's like this amazing Rolex watch where everything just works in perfect synchronicity.

All of those things.

And you go, that is an amazing creator.

And that was the design of all of that.

Now let me just get you to think of this.

Let me say I went to my kids.

So you got to imagine this.

So you got to use your kind of your brain a bit.

A bit more than you might like to.

But just imagine I'm the strongest man in the world.

Okay.

Just try to take your brain there.

So let me, let's say I go to my kids and I go, I'm the strongest man in the world.

Now kids tend to believe their dad's the strongest man.

But I go, I'm going to prove that I'm the strongest man in the world.

And I bring a little kid from kindergarten and I beat him up.

They're going to go, nah, dad.

That's not proof that you're the strongest man.

Let's bring the second strongest man in the world.

And then you fight him.

And if you win that, then we'll be convinced you're the strongest man.

So what God has done is he said, I'm going to put myself on display in ways that show that no weakling could have done this.

That no mediocre could have done this.

This is in the class of supreme excellence that you're going to see this.

So what I want to do tonight.

Whoops.

Is take you on a bit of a journey into one of the ways God puts on display his greatness, his beauty, and it's through the world of monsoons.

And I don't know if you've ever studied monsoons.

Kim and I about two years ago watched a documentary series.

I think it was a four or five part series on monsoons.

And it was fascinating.

And it gave to me this new appreciation.

Of the design of our planet.

And how all the climate systems work together.

So that is the monsoon area in orange of the world.

And what you need to understand about that.

Is that that's about half of the world's population.

And so what a monsoon is, is that those parts of the world don't have rain for seven or eight months of the year.

And then they have rain.

And then they have basically nonstop rain for four or five months of the year.

There's records in India that sometimes during that four to five month rainy season.

That they'll get a meter of rain in one day.

So that's the deluge that comes on.

What I found out in this series was that.

So half of the world is affected by monsoons.

We don't get it in North and South Africa.

We don't get it in North and South America.

But that feeds their entire economy.

So all of their economy is dependent on those monsoons coming.

And so as you begin to understand how they come about.

It is absolutely fascinating.

So I'm going to get you to do that with me.

So there's two starting points for a monsoon.

One is in the south.

One is in the north.

Both involve great amounts of heat.

Close to the ocean.

So in Australia.

I don't know if you've ever watched Australia in our winter.

But it gets up to 40 degrees.

And then in their very dry spots.

You'll get these tornadoes of fire.

And you watch them as they cycle.

In the middle of those.

And they go about 100 meters high.

It gets to about 1000 degrees centigrade Celsius.

In the middle of those tornado fires.

Okay.

So it's super heated hot air.

That goes way up in the sky.

So what happens when you get a whole lot of heat.

That's creating into the sky.

It draws in air.

It needs to be fed.

And so where does that air come from?

Well Australia is an island in the middle of the ocean.

So it starts to draw in air from the ocean.

But it's so hot.

That it's drawing in fast air.

So it's creating super.

So it's creating storms on the ocean.

And so the ocean begins to get stirred up.

But all of this moist air is coming in and gets sucked up.

And it goes up those tornadoes.

And it shoots it high up into the sky.

And so now you get clouds.

Okay.

And but what's happening in the ocean as it gets stirred up.

Is it stirring up all the nutrients from the bottom of the ocean.

That the plankton feed on.

And that then feeds.

Thousands and thousands of fish.

But that's a different story.

That has nothing to do with the actual monsoon.

It's just one of the benefits of it.

Is it stirs the ocean.

And brings the nutrients to the surface.

So all of that hot air.

The higher it goes.

That cooled moist air.

As it cools.

Forms clouds.

Those clouds get heavier.

So that's Australia.

Okay.

The north.

Is the Tibetan plateau.

So right underneath that.

You'll see a grey line.

That's the Himalayan mountains.

Okay.

So the tallest mountain range in the world.

Just north of that.

Is a large flat section called the Tibetan plateau.

Part of China.

And that is what they call basically a hot plate.

So it gets super hot.

And that draws all the moist air.

So you see India there at the bottom in the middle.

All of the Indian Ocean.

Indian Ocean.

Moist air gets drawn in.

And guess what it hits.

The Himalaya mountains.

And it can't go any further.

So now you get building clouds.

Building water.

Huge amounts of water.

That are being drawn in by this hot plate on the plateau.

Stopped by the Himalayan mountains.

And it's accumulating.

Accumulating.

Accumulating.

And then in Australia you got this accumulating water.

Water coming out of all of this heat as well.

So you got two huge cloud systems that now start to join.

Follow what's going on there?

Okay.

So then it starts to rain.

This part.

So you got to keep your thinking cap on.

Because I'm going to give you a bit of a geography lesson here.

So right in the middle there you see this black line that goes all the way down.

Well that's the Mekong River.

It's 2500 miles long.

And it feeds or goes through five different countries in Southeast Asia.

So you see Vietnam, Laos and all of that up through there.

Okay.

So that is the Mekong River.

So what happens once the monsoon starts?

The Mekong River increases its flow by 400%.

Can you imagine if the Red River increased its flow by 400%?

There would not be a Winnipeg.

The flood of 97 would be just a little bit of a joke.

But this Mekong River increases by 400%.

And so all of these countries then, this river that was very small, it overflows its banks.

And it just starts to spread.

But there's another thing.

So you got to follow as it comes down.

I'm going to go to the next slide.

You see it turns.

Into Cambodia.

And you see Phnom Penh there, the little black dot.

That's where it joins up with another river.

Okay.

And then it goes down into the ocean.

So above Phnom Penh, you see a lake there.

And that's Tonle Sap Lake.

Okay.

So what happens is there's so much water coming down the Mekong River that it hits this other river that's trying to get to the ocean.

And there's so much water that the water from that lake reverses.

And goes backwards.

And it now goes back into that lake.

And that lake grows by eight times its normal size.

And I've actually watched satellite maps of Tonle Sap Lake growing and growing.

But more than that, so now you got the water from the Mekong meeting this other river.

And then it's backing up into this lake.

But millions of fish are now going into this lake that's growing and growing.

And growing.

And growing.

Okay.

Then the monsoon stops.

And then the river changes direction and starts heading back to the ocean.

And it empties out all of these millions of fish.

And there they get 30,000 tons of fish in Cambodia.

And it's their main food supply.

And it's all because of a monsoon.

Isn't that fascinating?

But more than just providing all this fish.

Because all of these rivers are going to be flooded.

And all of these rivers overflow because this lake grew to eight times its normal size.

Now you got all this silt that was carried.

And guess what?

It fertilizes the whole country.

They don't need fertilizer now.

Because they've got all this silt that was carried down from the mountains.

And has spread because of the overflowing rivers and lakes.

And then because of the rivers backing up.

There's salt in that.

And they have this area 12,000 miles that becomes this flat of land.

And it dries and turns into salt.

And they have a huge salt factory that harvests all this salt.

Just because of a monsoon.

And then all of the river water getting to the river starts to drop the nutrients and all the dirt that it picked up.

That was going quite quickly down the river.

It slows down when it hits the ocean and creates a delta.

And that delta has all kinds of nutrients that go into the water that feed the fish.

Okay.

So you got all of that information.

And that's only one little wee part of what happens with a monsoon.

Do you see that?

You could say, well isn't that an interesting coincidence?

It gets hot in Australia.

And it gets hot in Tibet.

And then you get a big rainstorm.

And then you go, but it happens every year.

It happens at a predictable time.

The whole economy keeping people alive is dependent on it.

Half of the world's population is dependent on it.

And it comes like clockwork.

Now isn't that a coincidence?

And you go, wow.

I wonder who designed that.

So that it somehow would work like that.

And that's what happened.

So let me give you just one little detail beyond that.

So as I'm watching this you go, okay.

Those years, those months of drought.

So it's four or five months of rain.

But there's seven or eight months of drought.

What happens as the drought gets worse and worse?

Plants start to dry.

Everything, the food, there's no more food for the animals, etc.

And then I found out there's this one tree called the Mahua tree.

And guess when it bears its fruit?

At the driest time of the year right before the monsoon.

So just when the animals are running out of things to eat, this weird tree out of total dryness pops out fruit.

And the animals get their last meal before the monsoon comes.

So what I've done ever since I was a boy is I said I love to learn about nature.

Because in learning about nature I learn about God.

Right?

And as I learn about nature I learn about God's greatness.

But his genius mind to design such an intricate web of systems that need each other.

But they feed each other and they keep this whole planet going.

And they keep us alive.

And so what God is saying is, I hope when you look at the monsoon and you look at that dumb Mahua tree, you go, wow.

And God says, I just put myself on display.

I hope you're impressed enough to want to know a little bit more about me and have a relationship with me.

And that's the design.

Let's pray.
