# Check2 - Original Brainstorming Session

*Conversation from September 8, 2025*

## Initial Idea

**User's Vision**: 
> "I would **love** an app or command where I can run something like pnpm typecheck, and when there's over 2500 errors in the project, have it output to a markdown file. From there, have that MD file split into 8-10 smaller markdown files, roughly 2000 lines each. Then feed it all to AI, and have that agent organize, group, classify, and create actionable task list out of the errors."

## Key Pain Points Identified

1. **VSCode Limitations**: "The most annoying part I find, especially in VSCode, is not being able to see all the errors. I can't scroll far enough."

2. **Disorganization**: "Its also extremely unorganized. So I could have 100 of the same easy errors that could be knocked out quickly, but they're all spread out and I dont know there's a group"

3. **AI Context Windows**: Main concern was making sure chunks are "the best way to make sure you can take that list, and feed it to an agent and still have enough of the context window to not trigger the agent to have to summarize immediately"

## Evolution of the Idea

### Threshold System
- Started at 2500+ errors as example
- Refined to: 200+ manual trigger, 500+ auto-trigger
- Configurable based on user needs

### Prioritization Strategy
- "Easier / groups that would 'show' the effect greater, first"
- "Fix 50, 50 wins. Only because in this context, it's about solving the high typecheck / linting error numbers"
- Quantity of fixes > complexity of individual fixes

### Scope Definition
- **Core**: TypeScript + ESLint errors
- **Future**: Astro, Vue, Svelte support
- **Delivery**: Standalone CLI tool

### AI Integration Approach
When asked how AI should receive the data:
> "I hadn't thought that part through yet. I'm open to hearing different options, especially FROM an AI model. How would you best like to receive it?"

**AI's Choice**: Structured Markdown with Metadata (Option 1)
- Single file = complete context
- Human AND machine readable
- Self-contained chunks
- Pattern-friendly structure

## Name Origin

**"Check2"** - Based on Chris Farley from Wayne's World 2
- Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r5TLJR2ovhM
- *"Check... check2... CHECK2!"*
- Perfect for a TypeScript error checking tool

## Key Insights from Discussion

### User Experience Priorities
1. **Visibility**: See ALL errors, not just what VSCode can display
2. **Organization**: Group similar errors together
3. **Prioritization**: Focus on high-impact, easy wins first
4. **AI-Friendly**: Optimize for AI assistant workflows

### Technical Requirements
1. **Multiple Config Support**: Handle complex TypeScript setups
2. **Smart Thresholds**: Automatic and manual trigger modes
3. **Chunk Optimization**: ~2000 lines for AI context windows
4. **Cross-Platform**: Work across different development environments

### Success Definition
Transform overwhelming error chaos into organized, actionable intelligence that both humans and AI can efficiently process.

## Original Conversation Flow

1. **Problem Discovery**: VSCode scrolling limitations, scattered errors
2. **Solution Refinement**: Smart thresholds, AI-optimized chunks
3. **Technical Decisions**: Standalone CLI, structured markdown
4. **Naming**: Check2 reference to Chris Farley
5. **AI Perspective**: Chose structured markdown approach
6. **Specification**: Complete technical documentation

## Future Vision

A tool that becomes the go-to solution for large TypeScript codebase maintenance, revolutionizing how developers and AI assistants collaborate on error resolution.
