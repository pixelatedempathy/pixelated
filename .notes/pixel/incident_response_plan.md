## 🛠️ **RESPONSE PROCEDURES**

### **P0 Critical Incident Response**
```
IMMEDIATE (0-15 min):
1. Sound the alarm - notify full response team
2. Assess safety impact - clinical lead evaluation
3. Implement immediate containment
4. Activate communication protocols

SHORT TERM (15-60 min):
1. Root cause analysis begins
2. Implement temporary fix if possible
3. Update stakeholders every 15 minutes
4. Document all actions taken

RESOLUTION (1-4 hours):
1. Deploy permanent fix
2. Verify system stability
3. Conduct post-incident review
4. Update prevention measures
```

### **Safety-Specific Protocols**
```
SAFETY INCIDENT DETECTED:
1. Immediate: Disable affected AI responses
2. Review: Clinical team evaluates conversation logs
3. Assess: Determine user harm potential
4. Respond: Direct professional intervention if needed
5. Fix: Implement safety improvements
6. Validate: Test fix with clinical oversight
```

### **Recovery Procedures**
1. **System Restoration**: Step-by-step recovery checklist
2. **Data Integrity**: Verify no data loss or corruption
3. **User Communication**: Transparent status updates
4. **Monitoring**: Enhanced surveillance post-incident
5. **Prevention**: Implement measures to prevent recurrence
