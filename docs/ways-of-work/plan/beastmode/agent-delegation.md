# Agent Delegation & Onboarding Plan: Beastmode Epic

This document details the onboarding, responsibilities, and task breakdown for each agent involved in the Pixelated Empathy Therapist Training Simulator (Beastmode) MVP.

---

## 1. Implementation-Plan Agent
**Role:** Generate and structure the overall implementation plan, ensuring all tasks are atomic, actionable, and trackable.

**Onboarding Steps:**
- Review the Epic PRD and tech spec
- Break down the MVP into atomic phases and tasks
- Create a master implementation plan in `/plan/implementation-beastmode-v1.md`
- Define measurable completion criteria for each phase
- Ensure all tasks are self-contained and executable

**Initial Tasks:**
- [ ] Create master implementation plan
- [ ] Structure tasks for parallel execution
- [ ] Validate plan completeness and clarity

---

## 2. Task-Planner Agent
**Role:** Decompose major tasks into subtasks, create checklists, and track dependencies.

**Onboarding Steps:**
- Review the implementation plan
- For each major task, create a detailed checklist in `/plan/checklists/`
- Track dependencies and order of execution
- Ensure research validation for each task

**Initial Tasks:**
- [ ] Create checklists for each major task
- [ ] Track dependencies and update as needed
- [ ] Validate research completeness before planning

---

## 3. API-Architect Agent
**Role:** Design and implement backend API endpoints, including service, manager, and resilience layers.

**Onboarding Steps:**
- Review backend requirements in tech spec
- Gather input on coding language, endpoint URLs, DTOs, REST methods, and resilience needs
- Design API architecture and document in `/plan/api-architecture-beastmode-v1.md`
- Prepare to generate code upon developer's "generate" command

**Initial Tasks:**
- [ ] List required API endpoints and methods
- [ ] Design DTOs and service/manager/resilience layers
- [ ] Document API architecture and implementation plan

---

## 4. Debug Agent
**Role:** Test, debug, and validate all new features, focusing on edge cases and compliance.

**Onboarding Steps:**
- Review debug mode instructions
- Prepare to systematically identify, analyze, and resolve bugs
- Set up bug tracking and reporting in `/plan/debug-beastmode-v1.md`
- Ensure all features are tested for edge cases and compliance

**Initial Tasks:**
- [ ] Set up bug tracking and reporting
- [ ] Prepare test cases for new features
- [ ] Validate compliance and edge case coverage

---

## 5. Thinking-Beast-Mode Agent
**Role:** Handle adversarial testing, bias detection, and meta-cognitive review for robustness and security.

**Onboarding Steps:**
- Review quantum cognitive workflow instructions
- Prepare for recursive information gathering and adversarial analysis
- Document adversarial testing plan in `/plan/adversarial-beastmode-v1.md`
- Ensure all modules are robust and secure

**Initial Tasks:**
- [ ] Document adversarial testing and bias detection plan
- [ ] Prepare meta-cognitive review checklist
- [ ] Set up recursive research and validation workflow

---

## Next Steps
- Each agent should review their onboarding steps and initial tasks
- Confirm readiness and begin executing their delegated responsibilities
- Track progress in the respective plan files and update status regularly
