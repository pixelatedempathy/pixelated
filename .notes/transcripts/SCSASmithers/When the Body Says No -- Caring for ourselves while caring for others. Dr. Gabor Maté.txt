The book and this talk is based on my work as a family physician, which I did for 20 years. And seven of those years, I was also medical coordinator of the palliative care unit at Vancouver Hospital, looking after terminally ill people, people dying of cancer, neurological diseases, and so on. And what I found in all those years, learned all those years, what I had not been taught in medical school, is that who gets sick and who doesn't is not accidental. That although we tend to think on cancer and multiple sclerosis, which I mentioned last night, or rheumatoid arthritis, or chronic asthma, psoriasis, eczema, colitis, Crohn's disease, any number of chronic illnesses. There's some random events that unfortunately and mysteriously strike a person. And occasionally, we think that we can explain the cause by the lifestyle of the individual, like smoking, of course, and its connection to lung cancer. But other than that, we think that these diseases are either mysterious and unexplainable misfortunes, or they are caused by people's genes. And what I found, quite on the contrary, that who gets sick and who doesn't is not accidental. And that who gets sick and who doesn't wasn't random. And that there were certain identifiable patterns, certain personality traits and ways of behaving, that people unwittingly, without knowing it unintentionally, but they brought the disease on themselves. And that wasn't their fault. They didn't know what they were doing, as you will see. But since we're talking about caregivers, and let me tell you one little fact. And since the book was published, which was about 10 years ago now, I think, or 9 years ago, there's been so much more evidence tending in the same direction. One bit of evidence about caregivers is that there's a structure at the end of our DNA, our chromosomes. Chromosomes is the strands where our DNA is located in our cells, in the nucleus of our cells. And these strands of chromosomes have at the end a structure called a telomere. A telomere is like the glue at the end. A telomere is like the glue at the end of my shoelace to keep the strands from fraying, to keep it together. When we're born, our telomeres are a certain length. And as we get older, gradually, gradually, they shorten as we age. And until at the end of our life, they become unraveled, at which point, so do we. Now, they looked at the... But it's a mark of aging, in other words. Now, they looked at the telomeres of mothers looking after chronically ill children. And they found that... They found that these women in their 30s and their 40s, their telomeres were 10 years shorter than their chronicological age would have predicted. In other words, the chronic stress of caregiving aged them by 10 years. Now, that doesn't mean, of course, that we shouldn't care for children or for other people that require our support. But it does mean that how we give care and what kind of support we get makes a huge difference. But it doesn't mean that how we give care and what kind of support we get makes a huge difference. And that's the nature of the problem. But that's the nature of the problem. And that's the nature of the health that we're faced with. And that's the nature of the health that we're faced with. You know that logic that we have in our lives does not differ much from cognitive data.bi So, I said that there were certain patterns of... Of being and behavior. and psychological relating. And psychological relating. of newspaper clippings that I'll read for you. As I give this talk, by the way, my advice is that you relate it to yourself. Don't just see it as an academic exercise or as a storytelling, but just see to what extent you recognize these patterns in yourself. So the first clipping here is by a woman who writes the article herself. These are all from the Globe and Mail. She's diagnosed with breast cancer. Her name is Donna. So she's diagnosed with breast cancer, and her doctor's name is Harold. Her husband's name is High, and Donna is the second wife. The first wife died of breast cancer. Now Donna, the second wife, is diagnosed with it. And so Donna writes, Harold tells me that the lump is small and most assuredly not in my lymph nodes, unlike that of High's first wife. Whose cancers had spread everywhere by the time they found it. You're not going to die, he reassures me. But I'm worried about High, I say. I wanted the strength to support him. And what do you notice? Her first and automatic thought is, how can I support my husband emotionally as I'm dealing with a potentially fatal illness? So this compulsive and automatic notion, of concern for the needs of others while ignoring your own, is a major risk factor for chronic illness. The other clippings I will read you are obituaries, all from the Globe and Mail. Obituaries are fascinating, because they tell us not only about the person who died, but also about what we as a society value in other people. And often what we value in other people is exactly what kills them in the first place. You heard the expression, the good die young? They do. And there's reasons for it. A lot of you are heaving a sigh of relief. Okay, I don't have to worry about myself then, you're saying. But listen to these obituaries. This one is a doctor who died at age 55. And I'm talking here about people who died before their time. This guy dies at age 55 in Toronto of cancer. The obituary says, and this is written as if it was a good thing, never for a day did he contemplate giving up the work he so loved at Toronto Sick Children's Hospital. He carried on with his duties toward his year-long battle with cancer, stopping only a few days before he died. Now, think about that one. If you're diagnosed with cancer, or if your friend of yours was diagnosed with cancer, would you say to him or her, hey buddy, here's what you do. Go back to work tomorrow. And all the time that you're getting chemotherapy and radiation and whatever else you're going through, just work every day until you die. So this compulsive and rigid identification with duty, role and responsibility, rather than the needs of the self, is a major risk factor for illness. The next obituary is written by a husband about his wife, Naomi, who died at age 55, also of cancer. And he writes, in her entire life, she never got into a fight with anyone. The worst she could say was, phooey, or something else along those lines. She had no ego. She just blended in with the environment in an unassuming manner. Now, the suppression of, in other words, she never got angry with anybody. The suppression, the repression of healthy anger, is a major risk factor for illness. It actually suppresses the immune system, for reasons that I will tell you later. So there's basically three ways of dealing with anger. One is to repress it, like this woman did. So these are the people that are always nice. You know they're always nice? I worry about really nice people. The other way is to give in to it, and to act it out, to go into rages. That's also unhealthy. The first, the repression of anger, leads to autoimmune disease and cancer. When you're raging all the time, that increases your risk of heart disease and strokes. So in the aftermath, the studies have shown, that in the aftermath of a rage episode, your risk of a heart attack doubles for the next two hours. Then there's the healthier expression of anger, or the healthy processing of anger, which most of us don't know how to do. We either do the one, or we do the other. I'll talk to you about healthy anger later. But how do we deal with anger, has a crucial effect on our health. And this guy writes, you know she had no ego. She just blended in with the environment, in an unassuming manner. And this is supposed to be a good thing. Now my wife's name is Ray, and she's an artist, and it's one of her books, one of her paintings, that provided the detail here, on the cover, and the color scheme for the cover for this book. And sometimes I say to Ray, you know we've been married 42 years, why can't you blend in with the environment, in an unassuming manner. But Ray has done her psychological work, and she's read my book, and she's also seen the studies. You know there was a study, just four or five years ago, presented at a major medical conference, that looked at 1700 women, over a ten year period. And over a ten year period, out of these women, those who were unhappily married, and suppressed their feelings, were four times as likely to die, as those who were also unhappily married, but expressed their feelings. So the issue wasn't, happy marriage or unhappy marriage, the issue was, did the woman express herself, or did she not? So when I come to this point at my talk, this permits me to reassure the men in the audience, that the next time you think your wife is a bitch, you should be glad about it. Now, I'll read you one more of these, I'll read you a couple more of these obituaries. This is a mother in the middle of the night, in Calgary, who died in her early 50's, again, cancer. Just look at this. A master at multitasking, she juggled several hockey practices, school board, orchestra, and other extracurricular activities. June 2005 brought terrible news to this mother of three, by not president of the parents' council, at Western Canada College. Emergency surgery revealed metastatic cancer, she refused the cloak of illness, she did not give up on any of her roles. You know, she had all these roles, and they were more important than who she was. She even continued her 5 a.m. bicycle trips around a nearby reservoir, now imagine that, when you're getting chemotherapy. She enrolled in a life coaching course, and upon graduation from the Adler School, she initiated Living Out Loud, a group for women with cancer. It's very typical of people who get chronic disease. And finally, another physician who dies of cancer, and again, how the obituary writes something that's clearly, when we look at it, is self-destructive, but the person didn't realize it, and neither does the individual. Who writes the obituary? Sidney and his mother had an incredibly special relationship, a bond that was apparent in all aspects of their lives until her death. As a married man with young children, Sidney made a point to have dinner with his parents every day, as his wife Rosalind and their four kids waited for him at home. Sidney would walk in, greeted by yet another dinner to eat and to enjoy. Never wanted to leave, never wanted to disappoint either woman in his life, Sidney kept eating two dinners a day for years until gradual weight gain began to raise suspicions. Okay? So that this poor man suffered under the belief that, number one, he was responsible, however everybody else felt, and number two, he must never disappoint anybody. So he actually couldn't say to his mother, you know, mom, I got amazing news, I got four kids, and I'm going to have dinner with them most of the time. Nor could he say to his wife, you know, Rosalind, I'm very close with my mom, she needs my support, so once or twice a week I'm going to have dinner with her. He just tried to please everybody all the time, and this need to please everybody all the time, it'll kill you. And for reasons I will tell you, and these reasons are not psychological. They're physiological. They have to do with the body, the immune system, and everything else. You can't separate the mind from the body. And the problem with my profession, the medical profession, is that we make two separations that are actually in life impossible to make. One is that we separate the mind from the body. We think that people's emotional lives are somehow separate from their physiology. Completely false assumption. Unscientific. Refuted by all the research. And yet if you go to a doctor, I mean I know some of you here have had autoimmune illnesses, for example. So ask yourself, when you've been to the physician with your rheumatoid arthritis, your joint being inflamed, or some other rheumatic condition, did anybody ever ask you about your childhood? Anybody ever ask you about your stresses in your life? Anybody ever ask you about your health? About your marriage? About how you relate to your work? About how you look after yourself or how you don't? Likely not. Likely what they did is they said, you got this illness, we don't know why you got it, and here are the pills. So they'll give you a medication to suppress the inflammation, or they'll give you a medication because autoimmune disease, the immune system, attacks the body itself, so we give you a medication to suppress the immune system itself. Or they'll give you cortisol or some kind of other steroid. Well, that's all we do. We don't talk about the life factors that may have contributed to the onset of the illness. And I can guarantee you, I can guarantee you that any of you here who've had chronic illness of any kind, you're going to recognize yourself in this talk completely and 100%. And you're going to wonder, why didn't anybody say this to me before? Because in the West, when I say the West, I mean the dominant Western culture, unlike Aboriginal cultures, unlike the traditional medicines of China or India or native traditions around the world, we separate the mind from the body. So we treat only the body. Unless you have mental illness, in which case we still separate the mind from the body. And the other thing we separate is the individual from the environment. As I said to you last night, those of you that were there, you can't separate people from the environment. People are shaped by the environment. And in lifelong interaction with the environment, that's how human beings live. Now let me give you three examples of that. Why you can't separate people from the environment. It's been shown now, for example, that children whose parents are stressed are much more likely to have asthma. Now, not controversial. Several studies have shown that. So in polluted areas where there is more asthma, it's the kids of parents who are stressed who are most likely to have the asthma. Now, most doctors have never heard about that. And if they did, they can't explain it. And yet it's so obvious, you see. Those of you that have asthma, anybody had asthma here before in your life? Okay. You were given two kinds of inhalers if you had asthma. One inhaler is probably called Ventolin, and its job is to open up the airways. Because what happens in asthma is you get a spasm of the muscles that surround the airways, so you get this narrowing of the tube through which air has to pass into the lungs, so you're wheezing and whistling and laboring your breathing. And the other inhaler you got would have been a steroid to suppress the inflammation, the swelling, and the inflammatory debris that clutters up the airway. So you get two inhalers. One is called a bronchodilator to dilate, open up the airway. The other is to suppress the airway. And the other is to suppress the inflammation. Now, what are these inhalers based on? The inhaler that opens up the airway is a copy of adrenaline. And the inhaler that opens up, that suppresses the inflammation, is a copy of cortisol. What are adrenaline and cortisol? They're stress hormones. Exactly. In other words, we're giving asthmatics stress hormones, the same stress hormones that are made by their own adrenal glands when they're stressed. All that's happened is, is that their own stress response mechanisms have been exhausted, and now we have to give them stress hormones from the outside. Now, guess what? If you have rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, what will they give you? Cortisol, the stress hormone. Shouldn't we be asking ourselves that if we're treating people with stress hormones, whether or not there might be connection between stress and their disease? Now, of course, why the children of parents who are stressed? Because the parents' stresses actually program the physiology of the child, because you can't separate the individual from the environment. And this is true all our lives. A study of women in Australia, 500 women, 550 women, who had lumps in their breasts that were of sufficient concern as to require a biopsy. Now, they had these biopsies, but before the results came back, they also had a psychological interview or questionnaire. It turns out after the results came back that if a woman had had a significant stressful incident in her life just prior to the onset of that lump, that by itself had zero effect on whether or not that lump was cancerous. Similarly, if a woman was emotionally isolated, that also had zero effect. But if a woman was emotionally isolated and had had a major stressor, the risk of that lump being cancerous was nine times as great as the average. Now, the medical doctors running the study couldn't understand this one either, because they said, how does zero and zero add up to nine? You see? Because we don't understand the connection between individuals and the environment. Now, here's the deal. If I were to... Act inappropriately towards you right now, if I were to stress you right now, physically or emotionally, you'd have three healthy options. But... Well, let's see, I won't go into that right now. If I were to stress you right now, what would happen is that that stress wouldn't just be in your head, it would be in your whole body. You know, your heart rate would go up, your nervous system would be firing off all kinds of impulses, your adrenal glands would be pouring adrenaline and cortisol so that you could escape or fight back. These are the flight or fight hormones. And so your body would be in a different state physiologically in a split second in order to help you fight or escape. That's good. So in the short term, the stress hormones help you fight or to escape. But... What do they do in the long term? In the long term, the stress hormones deplete your body, suppress your immune system, give you heart disease, high blood pressure, give you ulcers, thin your bones. Okay? Now, what would happen if you were stressed, something happened that was stressful to you, and you're sitting there all upset about it, and your body is in a state of imbalance and upset, but somebody that you trust came along and said, Hey friend, I see that you're not feeling well. I see that you're upset. Puts a hand on your shoulder and says, Hey, do you want to talk about it? And what would happen to your body right away? Yes, it would relax. You take a deep breath. Your brain would get oxygen. You start thinking more clearly. Your heart rate would slow down. Your blood pressure diminish. The stress hormones abate in your system. And you go back into a healthy balance. All because somebody said, Hey buddy, do you want to talk about it? You're not going to talk about it. Those women that had been stressed, but were emotionally alone, the stress hormone acted on their system for months. That's why they were more likely to get cancer. It's really straightforward. In other words, again, the physiology of one individual can't be separated from the psychological and social environment. And finally, at the end of life, a study in a major medical journal a few years ago showed that amongst elderly couples, when one of them is hospitalized, what do you suppose happens to the other one? They get sick. In other words, the risk of illness goes up in the other one when the one is hospitalized. Why? Because their immune systems are not isolated from our psychological, emotional, social relationships. You can't separate the mind from the body. And you can't separate the individual from the body. You can't separate the mind from the environment. So how this works, I'll tell you in a few minutes, but I'll just illustrate it with a disease I'm quite interested in. Because, again, medical science says we don't know the cause of it. And I think that it's only because we're not looking. And I'm talking about a rare condition called ALS, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, which is a degenerative condition of the nervous system that leaves you very rapidly, completely paralyzed. Your mind is intact, but your body is paralyzed. And in the end, you can't breathe, and you die of respiratory failure. And right now, there's a court case with somebody with ALS who wants the right to medical suicide. And you remember Sue Rodriguez in Victoria, who went through the same thing, and her case was rejected in the Supreme Court. So it's a very dire disease, and it carries a terrible prognosis, and most people who get it are dead within a few years. And it strikes otherwise healthy people. So a woman came to me for a second opinion about 12 years ago now, actually referred to me by my friend Gordon Neufeld, a psychologist. And her story was that she'd been diagnosed with ALS by one of the leading experts in the condition in British Columbia, or in the world, actually. But she didn't want to accept the diagnosis. She wanted me to tell her that it was only stress. Well, it was ALS, but it was also stress. Her story was that she was a teacher and a vice principal at an elementary school in the lower mainland of BC, in Richmond. And she found at a certain point that she could no longer hold a pen in her hands because her fingers just wouldn't obey her brain's commands. She also began to experience difficulty walking. Now, you would think if that occurred to you, you would very urgently seek a medical opinion. Not her. What she did is she'd get up for months. She would get up at 5.30 every morning, slowly get herself dressed, of course, because her fingers would have trouble buttoning or pulling zippers. She'd drive herself to school, walk into school at 7.30 with her troubled gait. She would clutch the chalk in her clenched fist, and painstakingly scrawl the day's lesson on the board for the students. Teach the whole day, go home, stayed up late at night to prepare the next day's lesson. Everything was slow for her, you see. And next morning, get up at 5.30. And she did that until she could no longer walk. Now, or barely. Now, is she alone in this? Not at all. Everybody I've ever looked at with ALS has got exactly the same personality and the same behavior pattern. Without exception. Without any exception. Doesn't matter who I interviewed or read about. In writing this book, I also looked at the medical literature. And in 1970, there was a study at Yale University Medical School about ALS patients by two psychiatrists who wrote the following. These patients, they invariably evoked admiration and respect from all staff who came into contact with them. Characteristic was their attempt to avoid asking for help. Hard study work without recourse to help from others was pervasive. There seemed to have been habitual denial, suppression, or isolation of fear, anxiety, and sadness. So no expression of negative emotions, so-called. Some spoke gradually of their deterioration, or, sorry, casually, like it didn't matter, or did so with engaging smiles. Now then I looked up the biography of Lou Gehrig, after whom the disease is named in North America. Now those of you who are old enough might know that Lou Gehrig was a great baseball player, played for the New York Yankees in the 1930s. And he set a record for a number of hits by a New York Yankee that was only broken two years ago by Derek Jeter. So that record stood for him. 80 years. Now, Gehrig set another record that stood for nearly 60 years, and that was consecutive games played. So he never missed a game. Now, did he never miss a game? And he was called the Iron Horse. I didn't know about this before I read his biography. I just knew he died of ALS. Let's look at what happened to him. Well, same thing. He was known as the Iron Horse because he never missed a game, and he didn't never miss a game because he was never sick. He was a human being. He had flus and colds like everybody else. Furthermore, being an athlete, he was injured. At one point, his hands were x-rayed, and it turned out that his fingers had been fractured 17 separate times. And each time, he would play through the injury, and his teammates would describe him as grimacing like a maddened monkey in agony as he fielded the ball, but he never missed a game. And yet, when a teammate of his, a young rookie, gets sick with a flu illness, and he can't play, and the manager's really upset with the guy, Garry says, what on earth are you talking about? He's sick. He can't play. Takes the rookie home to his own house where he lived with his mother. His mother puts this rookie into Garry's own bed, loose sleeps on the living room couch as his mother nurses his kid back to health, and he himself never missed a game until he could no longer walk. Now, this is typical with everybody with ALS. Now, are we blaming patients for causing their own illness? Well, no, we're not, because it's not deliberate. It's not deliberate. These are unconscious patterns. Let me give you an example from my personal life. So, when I was 54 and my mother's 78, she was in a nursing home. Because she had a genetic illness called muscular dystrophy, and she could no longer walk, move her arms much. Mentally, of course, she was completely with it. She died at age 82. And by this time, she was a widow, and she had to be in a nursing home. Now, one afternoon, I'm visiting her in a nursing home, and as I'm walking down the hall of the nursing home, I have a bit of a limp, just a slight limp. The reason I'm doing this, the reason I had a limp is because I had arthroscopic surgery that morning on one of my knees, a surgery which is minimally invasive, and they just cut out a piece of a torn cartilage, which I incurred because I used to jog on cement, and I didn't pay attention to the fact that it hurt, jogging on cement. I missed a lecture in medical school about the relationship between pain and tissue damage, so that I didn't know this was a bad thing. So I continued to jog on cement, tore a cartilage, surgery that morning, that afternoon, bit of a limp. When I get to my mother's room, I open the door, and my limp disappears. And I walk into her room with a perfectly normal gait, greet her, revisit, I walk out again in a balanced way, and then I close the door behind me, and I start limping again. Now, what do you suppose I was doing? Anyone? Taking care of her, not wanting her to worry, yeah. But here's the thing about my mother. She was 78. She had survived the Second World War. She had survived the Nazi genocide, the death of her parents in Auschwitz. She survived communist dictatorship, the Hungarian Revolution in 1956, emigration to Canada with two adolescent boys and my father, the birth of a child in Canada when she was 39 in a new country. The whole immigration experience. Do you think she could have handled the fact, and she was a mentally and emotionally very strong person, do you think she could have handled the fact that her middle-aged son had a bit of a limp the afternoon of the arthroscopic surgery? Had I thought about it, I would not have suppressed my limp, but the point is I didn't think about it. It went back to my very first year of life, when, I was two months old when the German army marched into Budapest, and my mother phones the pediatrician to say, would you please come and see Gabor, because he's crying all the time, the day after the invasion. And the pediatrician says, of course I will come, but I should tell you all my Jewish babies are crying. Now what do you think that was about? What did I as a two-month-old know about Nazis or Hitler or genocide? What was I reacting to? The stress of my mother. Infants pick up on the stress of their mothers. And the infant learns very quickly that if the mother is so stressed already, that if I add more stress to it, that might threaten my relationship with her, because she'll be even more unhappy. Then the infant will learn to suppress their own pain, simply to maintain their relationship. Now that's not a mother's desire ever to give that message to an infant, but we do automatically and unconsciously. That's just how it works. And that becomes the memory, and I'll talk to you, Gabor, about those memories later, but it becomes a memory without recall. I don't recall that time in my life, but the memory is in my body. And my friend Servas, who works with bodies a lot, he sees the body memories in the way people stand, or they hold themselves, or the way they walk. And we hold these memories in our bodies, and we're not even aware of them up here, because there's no conscious recollection. So that suppression of my limb was a body memory of what I had to do to maintain my relationship with my mother. Now the woman with ALS, the teacher, she was an adopted child. And shortly after the adoption, guess what? Her mother gets pregnant. And the biological child was the mother's center of attention. And the adopted child, from an early age on, learned, or at least perceived, that she wasn't loved and accepted and celebrated like the biological child was. And hence, she worked to make herself lovable. And how do you work to make yourself lovable? By suppressing your own feelings. By always being nice. By always taking care. And always ignoring your own needs. And it was purely unconscious. This is her coping patterns since she was a small child. She did not do it deliberately. And Lou Gehrig's father was an alcoholic. And if any of you grew up in homes where there's alcoholism, you know how it works. It's that the children, or one of the children, becomes the caregiver to the parents. Emotionally and even physically sometimes. And that then becomes your personality. That then becomes how you live your life. Because you think that's who you are. Because how we are as kids, we think that's who we are. That's not who we are. But that's what we come to believe. And that's who we, that's how we behave then. And that's what creates these patterns. So there's nobody here to be blamed here. Nobody here to be blamed. It's just how it works. Now, why does these, why do these patterns translate into illness? That's because, as traditional medicine has always understood, and as Western science, has now confirmed, mind and body are inseparable. So if you look at the important systems in the body, in the brain, they're completely connected. So that the emotional centers in the brain are connected to the immune system, and the hormonal apparatus, and the nervous system. Now the emotional centers in your brain have one major role to play to keep you alive. Now, what is the biggest need of the newborn? Emotionally speaking. And even physically speaking. It's attachment to the adults. Without that attachment, we don't survive. You can see that. This is true, of course, of baby birds and baby mammals. But especially of human beings, because we're the most underdeveloped and the least mature, and the most helpless for the longest period of time of any creature on Earth. And I'll say much more about that in my talk on ADHD. Now, that means that our brains are wired for attachment. We're wired to attach. Big centers in our brains are dedicated to maintaining our attachment relationships. That's our biggest need. Those emotional centers in the brain are connected with the nervous system, because the nervous system warns us when our attachment needs are not being met, and then we cry. And then we get stressed. That's the hormonal apparatus. And all that has an impact on our immunity. Because it turns out that all these systems, the hormonal apparatus, the immune system, the nervous system, and the emotional centers in the brain are connected by the nervous system into one giant electrical grid. Fibers of the nervous system are connected to the brain. So that anything that happens in one aspect of that system happens in the other aspects. So they're connected. So that electrical fibers or nervous fibers from the brain go to the spleen, where the red cells are stored, or to the bone marrow where they're manufactured, or to the thymus gland in the neck where immune cells mature, and back up to the brain. So there's a constant neurological communication that's going on in our systems. 24-7, every second, every millisecond. That's one form of connection. The other connection is by means of chemical messengers that each of these systems secrete into the circulation. Which then travel to the other organs. So that the brain reads what's happening in the body. And the body reads what's happening in the brain. In terms of that the immune cells in our circulation can manufacture every hormone that the brain can manufacture. So the immune cells in your circulation are talking to the brain. And listening to the brain. That's the second connection. The third connection is the brain-gut connection. So let me ask you this question. And I'll ask for a show of hands. If you've had the following experience, please just put your hand up. That is, that you had a powerful gut feeling and you ignored it and you were sorry afterwards. If you've had that experience, put your hand up. Just about everybody here. Now, why is it that the gut is so much brighter than the brain is? Not the brain, but the mind. Than the intellect, I should say. It's very simple. Because the gut is connected to the brain, in fact, the gut sends many more connections than vice versa. When the gut receives messages from the brain, it reads them and it magnifies them and sends them back up to the brain. So the gut feelings tell you the whole picture. Your thoughts only tell you a small part of the picture. So people who had a stroke in the part of the brain where language is processed, these are called aphasiacs, they're better able to tell when somebody's lying than the average person who can understand speech. Why do you suppose? Since they don't understand the words, what are they paying attention to? The gut feelings, which read the body language of the person. The facial expression. The congruity of the mouth and the eyes. When the person is smiling, is it just the mouth all smiling? Have you seen the parliamentary debate on CBC? When the politicians stand up and they smile? They're grinning here, there's nothing up here. It makes you uncomfortable to look at it. Anybody with gut feelings would turn the TV off. Now, there's another large group of people, another large group of human beings who read gut feelings accurately and respond to them. And what do we call those people? Children. Small children. Young babies don't listen to words, they don't even understand them. But they react unerringly and intuitively to gut feelings. Now, guess what? When you put your hand up and told me that you've had stronger feelings that you've ignored and you were sure afterwards because you believed your intellect rather than your guts, you told me the story of your childhood. And the story of your childhood is that you were born with the gut feelings intact and connected completely. But at some point something happened to you. At some point you got the message that in order to survive and to be acceptable you have to suppress your gut feelings. Because here's how it works. Children have two needs. Infants. Anybody. Any human being. We have two basic needs. And the more immature we are the more important the first need becomes. And that's for attachment. And attachment means that connection with another human being for the purpose of being taken care of. That's an absolute need of the small child. Can't live without it. Impossible. So that's one large need. Another need, however, we have to function as fully human beings is to be authentic. Authentic means that we know who we are, what we feel are able to express it and able to honor it in our behavior. So we have the need for attachment and we have the need for authenticity. So far so good. But what happens if in order to attach we have to suppress our authenticity? Because our parents can't handle who we are. Because they can't handle our anger because they can't handle our two year olds because they can't handle our expression of our needs because they are too stressed they are too needy like my mother was in that terrible situation. Then we suppress who we are we suppress our authenticity and we suppress our awareness of our gut feelings because the expression of them would bring us into conflict with our caregivers and threaten our attachments. And so our problem as adults is that we a lot of our behaviors are still coming out of our need to attach so we are still behaving like little kids who need to attach and need to be liked and need to be accepted and approved of at the expense of our authenticity. And that people is what makes us sick. Now a fourth connection I didn't even know about but has been described since I wrote my book is the heart brain connection. It turns out that the heart itself has a nervous system and the pericardium which is the fibrous membrane that surrounds the heart there is a network of nerves which have predictive capacities so when people say especially for negative things so when you say oh I knew it in my heart you did and that brain in the heart whatever happens emotionally and how we live our lives has a huge impact on our physiology because these systems are not separate they are just one system. So let's look at the question of how the repression of anger then might suppress our immune system. So I'll ask for a volunteer here and whoever volunteers I can promise you two things one is that you might feel uncomfortable for a minute and the other is that you learned something about yourself. Okay? So who volunteers? Thanks, right there. What's your name? Lorraine. Thanks for volunteering. Here are the rules. This is a metaphor or a representation of your life. You sitting in that chair. Therefore you can't leave the chair. So whatever happens you have to stay exactly where you are. Other than that you can do whatever you need to. Got it? So Lorraine what I'm going to ask you is if you're okay with me standing right here as I give the lecture. So I'm going to come closer now and I'll ask you if it's still okay. If I give the lecture here is that still okay with you? It's fine. What about if I stood right here and gave the rest of the lecture right here? How would that be for you? It would be a little uncomfortable. It's uncomfortable. So what would you like to do about it? For you to step back. You'd like me to step back? How are you going to get that? You can ask me. You can ask and I'm going to say heck with you and come a bit closer. Okay? You'd push me away right? You'd push me away? Okay. Very good. As you were pushing what emotion do you think you'd be generating? My guts were just going like this and I was feeling really smothered. That's why you pushed me away but as you were pushing what do you think you'd be feeling? I felt. Not what you felt but what you would feel if you were actually pushing me. What's the emotion do you think that would be there for you? I think that would be like I don't know a little bit of anger and a little bit of Exactly. Anger. And that's a healthy anger. Now healthy anger is nothing but a defense of your boundaries. And basically Lorraine what you'd be saying to me is you're in my space, get out. You're in my space, get out. Now if you said that in the first place you would need to be pushing me. Right? But the pushing itself it's good. It's a good response. It's a healthy response. So in other words healthy anger is an expression of a boundary defense. So the job of our emotions now by the way if I was somebody else in your life, I mean somebody that had a different relationship with, you might welcome them coming close to you. Right? No I don't mean me. I mean your child or your partner or whoever somebody. You might actually embrace them in a different situation. So the role of emotions basically is to respond to approach and welcome the healthy and positive approach and to keep out the unhealthy and aggressive one. So it's either I want more of this or I want less of this. So that's the job of healthy anger. That's the job of the emotions. In other words it's to let in what's healthy and nourishing and to keep out what's dangerous and unwelcome. That's the job of emotions basically. Now what is the job of the immune system? Yeah so basically the job of the immune system is to keep out what's unhealthy like bacteria or to kill cancer cells that's what it does or to let in what's healthy. Like vitamins and nourishments and so on. If your immune system attacked the particles of food and destroyed them before you had a chance to absorb them you wouldn't live. So that the job of the immune system is like that. It's been called the floating brain because it has recognition capacity reactive capacity and learning capacity. It's the same as the emotions. Immune system does the same thing as the emotions. Protect us and let in what's healthy. And that's what we need. Given the unity of all these systems it's obvious that when you suppress the one you're suppressing the other. And that's why people that suppress anger they have diminished activity of their immune system as has been shown in studies. Or what happens is that the immune system gets so confused because our emotions aren't confused that it turns against ourselves. And that's when you get autoimmune disease. When the immune system actually attacks the body itself. Fundamentally what happens is one way or the other if you don't know how to say no when you need to your body will say it for you in the form of illness. So chronic illness represents the body saying no when you didn't do it. Not your fault. This is how you were programmed before you had any choice in the matter. So again it's not a question of blame or any kind of judgment but it's a question of self-blame. But it does mean that to prevent illness or if you have an illness to deal with it more effectively you need to learn to assert who you are and to say no. Now that might be difficult sometimes because the people in your life have got used to you as a yes. They've always heard you say yes. Some of them might not like you very much if you start saying no all of a sudden. And what you're going to do when you start saying no is you're going to find out who your friends are. Because the real ones are going to say to you hey I'm so glad you're finally saying no. And the ones that were simply there because you were constantly available for them are going to oh what happened to her or him? That's it. But it will create some conflict which will trigger all your fears about attachment. So you're going to have to learn that you are more important than your attachments. That wasn't true when you were a kid but it's true as an adult. I'm going to finish with one story and then we'll take questions and do a couple of exercises for you. Gilda Radner you might remember her as a comedian on Saturday Night Live. And she died of ovarian cancer. And I didn't know anything about her life but I read her biography because I knew she died of cancer and guess what? It's the same story over again. So Gilda Radner was a very unhappy child and she was overweight as a child and she was thin as an adult because she was bulimic. So all the time that she was a star she was actually a bulimic. Typically she didn't tell her mother. Her mother didn't know that she was bulimic until after she had died. Why? Because she was still protecting her mother. Just like I was with suppressing my limb. Her father died when she was 12. A loss she never overcame and so what she did she always got into relationships with men where she would suppress herself to fit the image that the man had that he wanted of her. And the only way she could feel close to her mother was to make her laugh. So guess what? She becomes a comedian. So many comedians by the way are very troubled people. And guess what? I have a son who wants to be a comedian. For good reason. And then she develops ovarian cancer. Even after her symptoms of ovarian cancer began to cause physical distress including bowel blockage Radner was more concerned with satisfying others than with her own needs. She sought and received advice from sundry sources. Her dilemma she writes in her autobiography suddenly I began to wonder how to please so many people. Do I take magnesium citrate? What about the coffee enema? Do I do both? Do I do the abdominal massage or the colonic? Do I tell the doctors about each other? East meets west in Gilda's body. Western medicine down my throat Eastern medicine up my butt. When it seemed she had been successfully treated Gilda became a poster girl for ovarian cancer featured on the cover of Life magazine. She was an inspiration to many but the recovery was short lived. Still attached to roles she had developed as a child she berated herself for having quote, let down others by developing terminal illness. I had become a spokeswoman for the wellness community and a symbol of getting well. I had been a model cancer patient completely active in my own therapy. Now I felt like a living example that didn't work. I'm just a fraud I thought. Only close to her death did Gilda finally learn that she could not be mother to the world. I couldn't do everything I wanted to do. I couldn't keep calling all the cancer patients I knew. And I couldn't try to help all the women with ovarian cancer. And I couldn't read every letter I received because it was ripping me apart. I couldn't cry all those tears for everybody else. I had to take care of myself. It is important to realize that you have to take care of yourself because you can't take care of anybody else until you do. Well, as trouble as you can, but if you don't take care of yourself in the process, you're going to make yourself ill. So the issue, of course, is not that we shouldn't provide care to other people. I mean, caring for others and being kind, that's wired into us as human beings. That's a true expression of who we are. But going along with that, there has to be self-care. That means that you must demand support. If you're caring for others, you must demand support when you need it. You must be able to have a break. You must be able to ask for help when you need it. You must be able to express how you feel. You must take time for yourself. There must be times in your life which is just for you. So that we have to find ways amidst the role of caregivers to actually care for the person here. Because if we don't, the result is burnout. And illness. So again, it's not a question of being selfish and unconcerned. That's not so good either for your health. But it's a question of being as kind to yourself as you are wanting to be to others. It's kind of the golden rule turned around. Do unto you. Not just do unto others what you would have them do to you, but also do unto yourself what you wish to do to others. Any questions on what I've said? Yes please. Well, addiction is something a bit different. It happens when we're stressed and we need to soothe ourselves. So when we allow all the stress to wash over us, and we don't keep the stress away, then we get overwhelmed. Then one way to deal with the stress is to become addicted. So that, it's very interesting when you look at families with addictions, you also see a lot of illness in other members. So they just represent different coping styles. The addict soothes themselves through the addictive behavior. The person with who doesn't go to addiction, they're good, they're going to go suppress themselves and develop illness instead. There's a question here, yeah. Yeah. That's what I was going to ask you about. The person that has an addiction problem, like I've seen this in quite a bit of people. They quit using their alcohol. Yeah. And then afterwards they become really like sober for like over a year or something, then they become chronically ill. So... Okay, you know what, let me give you the mic so that people can hear you. It's a good question. Thank you. People with addictions, like maybe alcohol, Yeah. they've been using alcohol to help themselves to self-medicate, but after that they stop using alcohol and knowing that their mental and emotional development isn't to par, they become chronically ill. Like I've seen that in a lot of people that I've worked with. Yeah. Yes. You would expect something like that because if you look at chronic illness, if you look at the childhood conditions that give rise to addiction, they also give rise to chronic illness. So these adverse childhood experiences that I mentioned last night, any of you not there last night? Okay, so there's a group of studies called the adverse childhood experiences studies. They look at children, or they look at adults and if they had physical, sexual, emotional abuse or death of a parent or some other catastrophic event in their lives, the more of these events there were the more likely they become to be addicted as adults. And the more likely they are to have autoimmune disease or cancer. So when people stop soothing themselves with the alcohol but they're not dealing with the stresses then as you say they're not dealing with the emotional stuff, then the illness will show up. That would not be not to mention that alcohol itself promotes certain kind of cancer. Other questions? On what I've said? Yes. Okay, yeah, so I'll just get you folks with questions to speak into the mic and that way everybody can hear you. I was just curious when you had mentioned about not limping, going into your mother's room About what? When you had mentioned about not limping going into your mother's room there's other theories about birth order and you're the oldest in the family can you isolate things off? I think birth order you know, I've seen this chronic caregiver pattern I've seen it at a lot of places every birth order possible it's not automatically a first born phenomena, I mean sometimes it's the second child who who becomes the good kid because like with my two boys with the first son we had a lot of conflict because we're not a very adept parents so the second son pulls in and suppresses themselves more as a way of I don't want that hassle I don't want all that conflict so he becomes the peacemaker it can happen at any point so birth order does have an impact but so many other factors are playing to it so I wouldn't isolate that one There's another question somewhere else? I should be loud enough actually Yeah you are, yeah I was just wondering, you mentioned bulimia I was wondering, can you elaborate on that is it addiction? What is that? Bulimia is a form of addiction and it arises for the same reasons that addiction arises what's that? You know what it is it's a it's a build up of tension and an urgent release so that it's a way of actually self created it's a way of releasing tension and there's that relief addiction I define as any behavior that you crave that has a sense of relief associated with it and which has negative consequences and you don't give it up despite the negative consequences that's what addiction is bulimia is an addiction the best way to understand it is a form of addiction and the causes of it go back to exactly the same factors that would underlie addiction see there's only one story there's only one story you treat kids well they grow up to be healthy adults you don't treat them well they're going to act out their unwellness in a number of ways and all the illnesses that we have and all these diagnoses are just different forms of people manifesting early trauma and early distress that's all it's very simple yes I was just taking up on the question about bulimia how do you see anorexia anorexia is related like do you see that as being addictive or is that more in the suppressing it's well let me just formulate it for you anorexia is an attempt to be in control of something and when you don't feel your life is in control that's one way to be in control because that's something nobody can control you with so you're going to be totally in charge it's it's an emotional or it's an attempt to deal with severe emotional loss that leaves you completely helpless but in this one area of your life you're totally in charge that's how I understand it and invariably it has to do with relationships with caregivers particularly mothers I don't blame mothers because the mother is just acting out what happened to them as kids but with the kids with anorexia there's always issues and you know I know that like the singer Anne Murray I think her daughter was anorexic and what I read about them it is a self suppression on the part of the daughter I think there's a lot of anger there that's being suppressed in anorexia and that anger is being taken out on the self that's how I understand it there was a hand somewhere else yes please what about what do you think about the idea of somebody getting cancer if they've experienced repeated physical traumas that have been accidental like somebody who's had a series of accidents throughout their life that have been potentially less threatening accidents than getting cancer at a very young age and dying from it well first of all I would say that nobody has a series of accidents accidentally ok so so that for example if you have if you constantly get into accidents I mean statistically it might happen sometimes purely randomly that you know you always happen to be where the lightning strikes but you know overall people that are accident prone it doesn't come from the outside there's something about them where they ignore risk or they're unaware of their environment or something and that has to do with early defense mechanisms I'll say more about that in my talk on ADHD which is to say that they're stressed so it would not be unusual then for them to get cancer but I don't think it's the physical injury directly that causes the cancer I think it's more the stress and even if I had a physical injury you see if you had a physical injury that's not the stress you know what the stress is let me ask you this question here some of you may wish to answer if you don't that's perfectly ok but is anybody here willing to acknowledge and you don't have to there's no pressure here that you were sexually abused as a child if that's true for you just put your hand up ok very good thank you at the very back how old were you when that happened 4 and for how long about a year and in that year who did you tell about it nobody thank you how old were you when it happened not very long a few weeks a few days even in those few days who did you tell about it nobody that's what the stress is because stress is not just what happens to us it's how we process it what you should have had to been able to do was to scream and yell as soon as anybody touched you the wrong way that's what you should have been able to do too it's just to scream and yell scream and run and ask for help the fact that you didn't is not your fault by the time you were 4 and by the time you were 11 you had already learned that you were alone in the world and that there's nobody there to listen to you so it's not that you made a mistake you just simply did what any child would which is to assess the situation unconsciously and you already knew that nobody there was there to support you and there when there's no support there then you can't express how you feel it's that suppression of the feeling and the non-expression of the stress response that actually creates the long term chronic stress so even if it's somebody with chronic accidents first of all there's reasons why they had them in the first place and in the second place they may not have had the environment where they could actually talk about their feelings and be listened to and understood and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here this is how we do stress and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here and that's how we respond without knowing anything about the particular case but this would be a general answer to your question yes ok now you have to really yell or come to the mic I have two things do you have any suggestions when we work with individuals and we know that they have tools because they use words like self-education or they know what is wrong with them but they say why bother so I think that's a good question yeah do you have any suggestions on how we can work with them yeah well first of all let me ask you a question all of you again I ask with a show of hands how many of you made new year's resolutions this year how many of you made new year's resolutions can I see the hands how many of you still kept them ok how many of you know what it takes to have a really good life in terms of nutrition and exercise and emotional balance and all that how many of you know what it takes how many of you are living it ok so first of all thank you first of all the person you are talking about is not that unique are they they are just like the rest of us so what I would say to that person is you know what ah listen to them what are they saying to you they are saying that they are discouraged they are saying that they are discouraged so just hear their instead of talking them out of it listen to them ah you sound really discouraged wonder what that's about for you you must feel really hopeless sometimes you know what even me I know how to live a good life but I don't do it it's just very hard really listen to them make sure that they feel validated and understood by you then they can get past it if you try to talk them out of it you can't and again a bit louder please second point is I I'm on an immunosuppressive drug right now and I kind of think maybe it's time to change my feel I mean I used to be a yes person but I'm wondering when I had trauma about 5 years ago it was a major trauma that happened in our family is that and then this past year is when I started getting this immunosuppressive issue and ulcers on my leg and is that is there a timeline when it finally starts to really affect your body like so I'll talk to my staff about self care how important it is and I've been doing that myself learning to say you know no I have to create new boundaries wanting to help people and that made me feel better but then I realized that I wasn't taking care of me right is there any suggestions on really on how to take back some of that you know and become more stronger with yourself so that you're not getting stage like I am trying to get off these drugs that I'm taking today well let me tell you about a friend of mine who lives in Calgary her name is Shannon Duke and Shannon is 48 years old now and when she was 37 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer stage 4 meant that the cancer was already in her bones by the time it was diagnosed at that time she had 2 young children aged 1 and 3 and married to a well-dressed well-to-do businessman she herself was a very high functioning executive for Microsoft in Calgary and then she's diagnosed she had the perfect life, perfect marriage, perfect home of course and then she's diagnosed and healthy, physically fit always ate well and then she's diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and she has a transformation now she gets the best medical advice she can get anywhere in North America and she traveled to New York and elsewhere she got the best medical treatment and with that she was given one year to live because that's the prognosis stage 4 despite the medical treatment chances are you'll be dead in one year now a year ago in February, just a year ago now Shannon traveled to the Napa Valley of California with some of her friends and they celebrated her 10th year survival and her 47th birth and the transformation that she experienced was when she was diagnosed and started paying attention she realized that her life had not been her life because she was sexually abused as a child and her response to the abuse was of course as many children will experience it can't be about the adults, it's about me so if this terrible thing happened to me I must be a very bad person so I have to be very good to compensate and I have to be a good daughter who doesn't talk about it who doesn't disturb the waters the good employee, the good student, the good wife who doesn't talk about the husband's addiction issues because that would again disturb the waters and when she's diagnosed and she decides she wants to live she says to hell with all this perfection and goodness and she confronts her family over the abuse that she had endured and she confronts her husband and she starts leaving an authentic and she leaves the job by the way and she starts leaving the job by the way wasn't really expressing who she was 11 years later the cancer is still in her bones but it's completely inactive but she knows that if she wants to stay alive she needs to stay authentic so that I believe that many of these issues are reversible I'm not promising a cure here to anybody but Shannon really underwent a major self journey and continues every day to work at it and she practices her spiritual ways which she ignored all those years and she pays attention to herself and she keeps clearing this stuff out and she is the picture of health her and I give workshops together sometimes so that there's ways to get there but it's a commitment and of course it might threaten the attachment relationships so that's always your call I'm curious about any correlation with the endocrine system with a person that is either living with alcohol related birth defects and trauma so when we look at what you're presenting here about mind and body connection and the immune system so you're speaking about a lot of hormones so my question is about if the endocrine system is not developed fully because of alcohol related birth defects I don't know the effect of I'm not expert enough to tell you if there's any correlation between alcohol effects and the hormonal apparatus, the endocrine system I do know that there's a correlation between trauma and the endocrine system that's what I've been talking about but I don't know the specific answer about alcohol, it's a good question I may need to look it up as long as it's finished we've got five minutes rather than take another question let me ask you to take a couple of minutes and answer the following question for yourself in what area of your life are you not saying no I'm talking about where there's a no that wants to be said but you're not saying it those areas are usually work or personal relationships and I suggest you just talk to each other just tell each other at your table or a partner if you don't want to talk, write it but have a conversation with yourself or somebody else at your table about where you're not saying no in your life, that would be a personal relationship or on your job, okay just have that conversation
