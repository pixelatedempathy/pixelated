# 🧠 MentalLLaMA Integration Plan

**Note:** This plan has been significantly updated as of 2025-06-26. The `MentalLLaMAAdapter` and `MentalHealthTaskRouter` were found to be stubs. Foundational implementation of these components, including crisis protocol, has been completed. `OpenAIModelProvider` has been added, and LLM-based routing + detailed analysis for `general_mental_health` is now functional. See `[.notes/in-progress/mentalllama-adapter-impl.md](mentalllama-adapter-impl.md)` for details on this foundational work. Many items below now depend on the *full* implementation of these components beyond their initial structure.

<summary>📝 Notes & Dependencies</summary>

- **CRITICAL NOTE**: The IMHI dataset has not been released publicly and is unavailable for our use.
- Integration must focus on model inference rather than training or fine-tuning
- Architecture learning should focus on methodological approach rather than direct replication
- Prompting strategy needed due to inability to directly fine-tune on proprietary dataset
- Consider reaching out to research team for potential collaboration

**Dependencies:**

- Compute infrastructure for model hosting
- Python bridge for model communication
- Evaluation framework for consistent measurement
- Test dataset development for validation
- Secure API implementation for mental health data

**Security Controls Implemented:**

- OAuth2 authentication with JWT tokens for secure authentication
- API key management system with rotation policies
- Rate limiting to prevent abuse (100 requests/minute per client)
- IP whitelisting for production environments
- End-to-end encryption for all data in transit
- HIPAA-compliant logging (no PHI in logs)
- Request validation middleware to prevent injection attacks
- Regular security scanning of containers
- Integration with existing RBAC system

## Prompt Engineering (Structure Implemented, Content & Tools In Progress)

The prompt engineering phase has seen the implementation of core template structures:

1. **Advanced Prompt Templates**

   - Created specialized templates for depression, anxiety, stress, suicidal ideation, and PTSD detection
   - Implemented templates for different clinical contexts (intake, crisis, therapy, monitoring, assessment)
   - Developed a system for template refinement based on evaluation results

2. **Comprehensive Test Datasets**

   - Built extensive test datasets for each mental health category
   - Included diverse indicators, severity levels, and edge cases
   - Created both positive and negative examples for better discrimination

3. **Prompt Evaluation System**

   - Implemented metrics for accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confidence
   - Built batch evaluation capabilities for comparing template performance
   - Created visualization tools for results analysis

4. **Optimization Framework**

   - Developed a systematic approach to prompt refinement
   - Implemented multiple refinement techniques for iterative improvement
   - Created tools for comparative analysis of refinement strategies

5. **CLI Tools for Testing and Evaluation**
   - Created a clinical scenario testing tool (`test-clinical-scenarios.ts`)
   - Built a batch evaluation system (`batch-evaluate.ts`)
   - Implemented tools for recommending optimal templates

### Key Files

- `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/prompts/prompt-templates.ts`: Contains core prompt generation functions and placeholder structures for the 5-Tier framework and specialized prompts.
- `src/scripts/mental-llama-analyze.ts`: CLI tool that utilizes the MentalLLaMAFactory and adapter for analysis (useful for basic prompt testing).
- Additional files for refiners, comprehensive datasets, and specialized CLI tools are TBD.

## Evaluation System (Initial Stubs, Needs Full Implementation & Review)

The evaluation system's integration with the new MentalLLaMA components needs to be developed:

1. **BART-Score Implementation** (Existing code needs integration with new Adapter)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/utils/bart-score.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs verification and integration into new adapter)
   - Evaluation modes and metrics need to be wired into `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality`.

2. **Clinical Relevance Scoring** (Existing code needs integration with new Adapter)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/utils/clinical-relevance.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs verification and integration into new adapter)
   - Metrics need to be wired into `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality`.

3. **User Feedback System** (Existing code needs integration review)

   - `src/lib/ai/mental-llama/feedback.ts` (Assumed existing per original doc, needs review for how it connects to new analysis flow and adapter)

4. **MentalLLaMA Adapter - Evaluation Aspect**
   - `MentalLLaMAAdapter.evaluateExplanationQuality` is currently a stub.
   - It needs to be implemented to utilize any existing or new BART-score, clinical relevance, and other metric calculation tools/services.
   - Fallbacks, debugging, and logging for evaluation are part of this future implementation.

### Next Steps (Revised)
1. **Implement Full Task Router LLM Classification**: Replace stub in `MentalHealthTaskRouter`.
2. **Implement ModelProvider**: Create actual `ModelProvider` for LLM interactions.
3. **Implement Adapter Analysis Logic**: Use `ModelProvider` in `MentalLLaMAAdapter` for non-crisis categories.
4. **Integrate Prompt Engineering**: Ensure defined prompts are used by `ModelProvider`.
5. **Implement Evaluation Logic**: Replace stubs for `evaluateExplanationQuality` in adapter.
6. **Performance Optimization**: Address deferred performance tasks.
7. **Security & Compliance**: Continue audit.

For details on what "foundational implementation" covers, see `[.notes/in-progress/mentalllama-adapter-impl.md](mentalllama-adapter-impl.md)`.
