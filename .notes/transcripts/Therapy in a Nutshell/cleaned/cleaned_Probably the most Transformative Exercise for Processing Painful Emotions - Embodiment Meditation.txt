This exercise we are about to do together is, in my opinion, life changing.  It will fundamentally transform how you interact with painful thoughts and emotions and relationships.  You will practice creating space for them so that you can be less reactive and more intentional in your actions.  It's a powerful transformative exercise, and at the same time it's not difficult to practice.  It's a simple skill, and I have invited mindfulness expert Thomas McConkie to join us to teach it.  As this exercise is designed to work with disturbances or uncomfortable emotions, it's going to be a little uncomfortable.

But if you find yourself getting overwhelmed, feel free to take a break, do something comforting, and then come back to this exercise when you feel more resourced or safe.  This exercise is about 12 minutes, and I have made a longer version of this video where I debrief and explore my experience with Thomas, because each time I do this exercise, something inside of me changes.  The first couple times it was pretty mind-blowing for me.  So if you struggle or feel confused during the exercise, definitely check out the longer version of the video to explore the why.  Okay, without further ado, let's jump in.  One of the things I have noticed is that for a lot of people, they have a hard time feeling their feelings.  Like, they do not know what it means, to feel their feelings, and that could include their emotions.  Like, they do not quite know what it means to feel what their emotions are saying.

But they also do not know how to sit with their body's sensations and what's going on there.  And I think a lot of people have a tendency to distract themselves or avoid having these feelings, whether they are emotional or physical, or they maybe suppress them.  They try not to feel them, they are maybe afraid of them.  -.  Or they intellectualize or distract themselves mentally so that they do not have to sit with them.  And that's what I am hoping you can talk with us about today, Thomas.  I am excited to talk about this today.  I am happy to.  I love the introduction.  It needs no embellishment, but if I were to add anything, I would just say from a Buddhist perspective that yes, we all do that as human beings.  We avoid ourselves, we are in conflict with reality, meaning like what is true right now, what's the truth of our embodied experience.  We are often in conflict with that and that causes profound suffering.  So this exercise is in service of everyday suffering for people like me and you, and a way to commit more fully to our embodied experience.  So the running and the evasion can all stop right here.  -.  I love that.  And a friend introduced me to this exercise, and when I did it, I was reminded that we can talk about feeling our feelings all day, but this exercise, we are actually just doing it.  We are just simply practicing it.  And I found it really valuable, really helpful for me.  So I was so grateful you were willing to share it with my audience.  Amazing.  Yes, I am happy to do it.  Do you want me to jump in?  Yes, let's go.  Let's jump right in.  Amazing.  I will ring some bells because they sound beautiful and it also helps us kind of settle in and really come to presence for this time.  -.  And we will just go, we will see, five or 10 minutes.  Great.  Sounds great.  So take these first few moments to settle into a posture that will allow you to be relaxed, comfortable, but also very present and alert.  It might feel natural to take a couple of big breaths.  I really like to take an audible sigh, an audible out breath to just help me relax and let go.  Yes, whatever works for you.  And this is also a really good moment, an important moment to ask yourself if it feels safe to really move deeply into sensation.  For many of us, at least some of the time, it's not the best moment to go deep into the body.  So we should not assume that an experience like this, a practice like this is always the right thing to do at any given time.  You want to check in with the body and get permission from yourself.  Like, yes, I feel resourced enough.  I feel grounded enough to, you know, go deep into my embodied experience.  And if you do feel resourced, and if you do feel a little bit adventurous, I will invite you to really just join your awareness right now with physical sensation.  Notice what's present.  We are working in this exercise with everyday disturbance hundreds of times a day, maybe thousands of times a day.  Things are happening at a preconscious and unconscious level where we just feel a little ruffled, a little disturbed, a little stirred up.  And those moments go undetected and we do not realize that we choreograph our lives around avoiding our embodied experience.  07.  12 terminar e Ellie Wo perceptions 105.  4 be a yoh indifference ein puisfect seng enough dpurash estas tengo a little bit kawa flies H burdensoms.

But if you are feeling quite tranquil and calm, I am going to ask you to stir that up a little bit just for the purposes of this exercise, to call to your attention a moment today or a moment this week where you had a kind of troubling encounter, could be with life itself, could just be inclement weather, but the deepest disturbance are often related to other human beings' relationship.  So the basic possibilities is when you bring your attention to the body, you already feel disturbance here.

But if you do not feel any disturbance, you can actually use this exercise to call up some disturbance.  Maybe the image of a person that you are struggling with in relationship right now, maybe an interaction.  Maybe you are feeling a sensation that did not go very well and it's kind of stuck in your system, it just does not feel very good.  And this is normally the exact kind of experience sensation that we avoid.  We try to shove it down, we repress it, we distract ourselves.  And we are doing something counter instinctual here by going right into it, going right into the heart of the sensation.  So you call up a disturbing encounter.  Something someone said to you, something they did, something that happened in life that left you feeling unsteady, unmoored, anxious, disturbed.  And as you continue to breathe, you can notice where this shows up in the body.  Where is the disturbance?  Where is the intense sensation that you would prefer?  You prefer not to be feeling, but nevertheless, it's present in your system.  And rather than running, evading, distracting, repressing, can you just relax into it?  Letting awareness soak into the sensation like water soaking through a sponge.  And really feeling what's here to be felt.  And really feeling what's here to be felt.  And really feeling what's here to be felt.  And really feeling what's here to be felt.  A key to doing this is to let go of any interpretations.  Because often times with disturbance we get a story going.  How dare that person?  That should have never happened.  Had that person been doing what they were supposed to be doing, I would not be feeling like this.

But in fact, we are feeling like this right now.  So it's an opportunity to actually really commit to our feelings.  To our embodied experience.  Letting go of the story.  Even something as simple as an emotional interpretation.  Letting go of even emotion and going right to the raw sensation.  And if it helps, you can use a word or two to describe whatever physical sensation you are aware of in the body.  For me, with my disturbance in this body, I am not feeling anything.  With my disturbance in this moment, I am aware of a clenching, a contraction in the throat.  A pressure.  I feel some ache in my heart.  So see if you can do that.  Just physical sensation.  No emotion, no story.  Just a little bit of that.  And it's important when we do this exercise to ask ourselves, Is the signal I am getting from my body indicating real danger?  In this moment, there might actually be something unsafe.  And you want to ask yourself that.  Is this signal from the body, this intensity, this disturbance, Is it signaling that something about the environment is unsafe?  And if it is, we want to take care of ourselves.  And change our circumstances as best we can.

But if it's a disturbance that's not indicative of any immediate danger, If we actually feel safe, that is, on an objective level, We can use this opportunity to go even deeper.  Really finding our awareness on the inside of this intense sensation.  Not trying to understand it.  Not trying to heal it.  Not trying to liberate it.  We are not performing any operation on it at all.  We are just training ourselves to stay embodied.  To commit to the truth of our embodied experience right now.  Stay with it.  And when you feel like you are really resting in this disturbance In a way that we do not normally do day to day, Unless we bring some intention to a practice like this, You have the option of saying to yourself, saying out loud, I commit to feeling this way on and off for the rest of my life.  I commit to feeling this way on and off for the rest of my life.  Sometimes when we make this declaration, we feel despair.  We feel like, oh no, I thought one day I would finally be free of sensations like this.  I would finally be delivered from the suffering of my life.  And if you feel despair, let that be a signal that you can let go of any fantasy That one day as a feeling human being you will stop feeling.  And accept this embodied reality that Sometimes life hurts.  Sometimes it brings us joy.  And that these are passing ephemeral energies.

On the other hand, sometimes we make this declaration, That I commit to feeling this way on and off for the rest of my life And a light bulb goes on.  We realize that a deeper part of us is completely resourced To feel these sensations, all sensations as they come and go no matter what.  We get an insight into the part of our identity that is bigger than all experience, all feelings.  And we realize that no matter what life throws at us, We can remain radically embodied, committed to the truth of this experience.  And so if that's your response to this practice, Just notice that, the freedom that comes with committing to this experience.  Either way it's good.  The despair is good.  The freedom is good.  Whatever we feel, it's information for us.  It's a way to feel.  It's a way to feel.  It's a way to feel.  Let this sensation run its course, however long it takes.  And at some point, as all sensations ebb and flow, You will find yourself on the other side of intensity.  And you will realize that you did not abandon yourself.  You committed to staying embodied.  And now, you are free to act from a state of You can act from a place where you are not avoiding yourself, Not avoiding your embodied experience.  You can be choiceful.  You have agency to decide, Do I do something?  Do I do nothing?  What's the next thing I can do?  The most wise, compassionate, and skillful thing I can do In response to life.  That's the Gap of boldness.  Welcome to a trance drowning, This experience de fines du pouvoir, A change of spirit, A real kamikaze, It's a kamikaze.  Hi there!
