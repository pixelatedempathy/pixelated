 Oh, welcome to another Friday night.  We've been doing deep dive into the 60 characteristics  of complex trauma to understand each one in greater detail.  And tonight we come to one of the sad characteristics  and those that have complex trauma,  when they end up in a position of authority,  they have a tendency to abuse their power  or to abuse that authority.  And I think it's key to say at front  that not everybody with complex trauma  will abuse their power if they get in a position of authority,  but it's a tendency that happens to everybody  and some give into it.  What happens if you have complex trauma  is you experience the abuse of power.  Those who are in a position of power over you  who are stronger than you abuse that  and that's why you ended up with complex trauma.  So complex trauma happens because of the abuse of power.  It's so important to understand that.  And so what happens in the child is they come to a place  where they hate the abuse of power,  they develop a heart for the underdog  for those who are experiencing the abuse of power.  They get to a point where they never wanna be  like their dad or mom who abused their power in their life.  But sadly for many, once they end up in a position of power  they end up abusing it themselves.  Now I don't want this talk to become a condemnation type of talk.  I don't want it to put you to a place of a lot of guilt.  I want you just to be aware of this area  and this potential in your life  so that you can stop it if it's already happening  or you can watch out for it  once you arrive in a position of power.  So let's begin with a definition what we're a power.  What we are a power.  So power is the ability to do something.  It is the ability to act.  It is the ability to influence others or influence things.  That's how we define power.  Every person that comes into the world has inherent power.  So you think of what looks like a helpless little baby  when it cries, it influences its caregivers to come  and take care of them.  So that ability to influence its caregivers is power.  So even a baby has the ability to influence.  And so I think it's obvious for everybody  but power can be used in a good way or a bad way.  It can be used to bless others or to harm them.  It can be used for good or for evil.  Now I want to stop and just say this.  People abuse power, they are doing it to bless themselves.  That's what they're thinking.  I don't care if I hurt people, I am going to bless myself.  But what they don't see is long term,  they also hurt themselves.  So in the short run it might look like they're blessing themselves  at the cost of hurting people,  but in the long run they hurt themselves, not just others.  The next thing to see is that power is not always a felt thing.  So you can have a whole bunch of power  and not feel like you have a whole bunch of power,  not even realize how much power you have.  So you don't have to be conscious of feeling powerful  in order to have power.  And then power changes in the context.  So you can be very powerful in one area  but have very little power in another area.  So that's just a basic overview around power.  Now there are different types of power.  So we think of physical power.  That's the one we think of most commonly.  And so that's being physically stronger than others  so that you can dominate them, hurt them.  Then there's verbal power.  It's the ability to use words to influence others.  So you can use words to encourage, to build up.  You can use words to sway people  and influence them in their thinking.  But you can also use words to mislead people,  to coerce people to do what you want,  to tear people down and to hurt them.  So words have the ability to bless or to hurt deeply.  They have power.  Then there's emotional power.  And it has two categories.  Think of a person who gets very podium.  They sit there with their bottom lip sticking out.  Believe it or not, that influences a whole bunch of people.  Some people come running in order to make them feel better,  to give them what they want.  So you can use emotions and your emotional state  to influence other people.  But then there's the ability that some people have  to stir up the emotions of others  in order to influence them.  So you think of a band that gets people  all worked up emotionally  and then they're just ready to do whatever the band says  they should do, or a politician or a preacher.  They know how to use words.  They know how to manipulate people emotionally.  And once they are worked up emotionally,  they can get them to do what they want.  And emotions becomes a very powerful way  of influencing people.  Then there's power that comes from knowledge.  You go to a doctor or an expert about a problem.  And you do what they say, why?  Because they're an expert due to their knowledge.  Then there's power that comes from position.  A judge, a president, a policeman, a pastor,  all are in positions of authority  and that gives them a certain amount of power.  Then there's the power that comes from reputation.  So that people don't even have to know you personally,  but they still allow you to influence them  because of your reputation.  Then there's power based on fear.  So when you get into the mafia, the gang world,  people give you respect.  People do what you want because they're afraid  of what will happen to them if they don't.  That's a lot of power.  But there's also flip side, power based on having integrity,  having character.  So people just look up to you because of that  and you have power of character.  Then there's power based on your association  with somebody else.  So you're the president's child.  You work for the king.  You are a pastor who represents God.  All of that association gives you extra power.  So that's a lot of different types of power.  Now one person could have all of those types of power  or they might only have one of those types of power.  It can vary based on the individual.  Okay, having given that as an introduction,  let me take to the abuse of power.  And I think where we need to start with this  is understanding those who have little power.  We say they're vulnerable.  And what the Latin word for vulnerable is to wound.  And so somebody is considered vulnerable  if they're susceptible to being hurt or attacked,  if they're weaker than others.  And so whenever power is used in a way  that wounds vulnerable people  or exploits them  or because the vulnerable are trusting the person in power,  that is called the abuse of power.  So a person more powerful than a vulnerable person  is now hurting them  or exploiting that vulnerable person's trust in them  than the abuse of power has occurred.  Now it's important to take this a little bit further.  So a powerful person often will attract vulnerable people  and they will promise vulnerable people  that they'll be there for them, they'll guide them  and lead them to a better life, whatever they might say.  But what happens after a while is the person in power  can get frustrated with these vulnerable people.  They're just a burden.  They're not contributing the way the leader thinks they should.  And so he sees them as an annoyance.  They slow him down from accomplishing his agenda.  And so those people, the vulnerable ones  now become resented by the person in power.  And that then leads to abusing them  saying, I'm going to walk all over them  because I have to reach my goal.  And sadly, that happens a lot  and that is the abuse of power.  So there's five things involved in abusing the power.  Number one, deception of self.  Every person who abuses power lies to themself.  Every person who abuses power is self deceived in some areas.  And it goes like this, they believe  that their mission is so important and so good  that it justifies hurting people to get there.  So that's how they distort and twisted in their own mind.  But secondly, it also involves,  they have to deceive those under them to some degree.  They have to get those people to trust them.  So they will say, I am going to take care of you.  I am going to lead you to the Promised Land  and they mislead them somewhat  or they get these people to do their dirty work.  They get these people to buy into,  it's okay to hurt people to get to this goal.  So they have to deceive people  in order to get followers.  Thirdly, they then have to coerce people at times  to do what they want even though the people may not want to do it.  So they will use fear, they will use guilt,  they will use different manipulation tactics  to get people to do what they want  even if it means they have to violate their morals.  Then you will find that they always operate by a double standard.  So they want you to treat them a certain way  but they don't treat you the same.  There's a double standard.  And then what is fascinating to me is that people  who abuse authority always talk about virtues.  The virtues that a good leader would talk about,  a healthy leader would talk about,  they talk about love and respect and loyalty and honor.  The problem is they twist the meaning of those words  and give them a slightly distorted  or a greatly distorted meaning.  So what do they mean by love?  They mean I'm gonna love bomb you at first.  I'm gonna make all kinds of promises to you.  I'm gonna do all kinds of things for you  just so that you will trust me and follow me.  It's so I break down your defenses  but then I'm gonna use you  and I'm not gonna be really giving you unconditional love.  My love has conditions.  So they've twisted the definition of love  but then they twist respect and loyalty and honor  and now it means if you're a loyal follower of me,  if you respect me, then you're going to lie for me.  You're not gonna rat me out.  You're not gonna make me face the consequences  of my hurtful decisions.  You're gonna enable me to hurt people  and get away with it.  So they twist the meaning of virtues  and that can be very confusing to the people  who are following them  because they're made to think they're doing a good thing  when they respect and honor and are loyal to the person  and actually they're doing a very unhealthy thing.  Some of the methods that they use to manipulate people  so they can't lead honestly by presenting the true agenda  by presenting who they really are,  they have to deceive and then they have to manipulate.  And so the first thing that gets people  into a position of power is they get promoted there.  So they get promoted because of their job  because of their skill set not necessarily  because of their healthiness  or they get married, they get a spouse  now they are physically more strong than that other person  or they become apparent.  They now have children that they're more powerful than  children who trust them naturally.  And so they now are in a position of power  just because they're promoted.  But then others use means  where they're just not naturally promoted there  to gain a position of power.  So they will use love bombing, they will charm you,  they will flirt with you, they will give you gifts,  they will make sacrifices for you,  also that you put them in a position of power  or they will intimidate, they will use fear,  they will use anger, they will just sheer force take over  and dominate.  That's another way to get to a position of power  or they will blackmail you,  they will find out some dirty secret about you  and threaten to expose it if you don't do what they want  or they will threaten something you love.  If you don't do what I want, I will hurt your child.  All of those tactics get people to a position of power  and many of those tactics are used  by unhealthy people to get to a position of power  so they can abuse that power.  Now I wanna just take a few moments  to talk about the consequences of the abuse of power.  I don't know if you've ever thought about it,  but almost every evil in our society today  is a result of somebody abusing power.  So if you were to go over the genocide wars,  what are the genocide wars?  Somebody or a group of people abusing power,  saying we're better than and so we're gonna get rid of them.  Colonialism, we have a sad day  and a sad couple weeks in Canada  where they've just again found more bodies  at residential schools of indigenous children.  A culture that came in and said,  we are going to make you speak our language,  follow our religion, we're gonna beat your language out of you.  We are gonna sexually abuse you.  All of that abuse of power.  And then slavery, all about the abuse of power.  Today we have a major issue around human trafficking,  abuse of power, kidnapping, racism.  All about the abuse of power.  All about somebody saying, we're better than you  so we're gonna mistreat you  and we feel justified in doing so.  Then, patriarchy, which says,  I'm the man, you're the woman, I can dominate you.  You have to do what you're told  and all of the domestic abuse that has come out of that.  Bullies at school who just use their physical power  to hurt and dominate, it's an abuse of power.  Rape and sexual abuse in all cases, an abuse of power.  Abuse within a family.  Abuse that's physical, verbal, emotional.  Abuse of power.  And then you can look at the lack of justice in our society  due to corrupt cops, corrupt judges, corrupt politicians  that allow injustice to take place,  that take care of the criminals  and let them get away with it, abuse of power.  And then you look at abandonment, neglect of children.  The people responsible to care for them aren't  because they have another agenda, abuse of power.  So it is just horrific,  a Pandora's box of evil that comes  is unleashed on society when there is an abuse of power.  I wanna take that just a step further,  to generational trauma.  So if you were to look at kind of the slavery thing  or the residential school thing,  the initial trauma came from outsiders.  Came from outsiders who tried to dominate those people  and hurt them and abuse them.  But if that person who was abused,  didn't have tools or opportunity to deal with that,  to heal, to get the safety,  they would carry around a whole bunch of anger,  they would carry around a whole bunch of pain  that would have to come out  and they would start to lash out at those closest to them.  And then the next generation,  if they still haven't dealt with their stuff,  now when they have children,  they're gonna start hurting their children.  Go a couple more generations.  Now you have the children with their children,  the their children with their children.  And pretty soon what you begin to find  is the majority of the trauma now  is not coming from outsiders,  it's coming from those closest to you.  Somebody has said this,  the worst that can be done to humans  is usually done within the families  where there is generational trauma.  And I see that all the time  and it is such a sad thing.  Somebody else has says this,  authorities figures such as coach, ministers  or teachers are rarely perpetrators of trauma or abuse.  These people often become the focus of high profile cases,  yet 90% of the time,  the abuser is a family member or a friend.  And so as trauma abuse becomes a generational thing,  then the greatest damage is done by those closest to you  and that becomes complex trauma.  Now I wanna add one piece here and that's this.  Many leaders today, sadly,  many people that get to positions of leadership  are narcissists, people who want the power,  people who want the prestige,  people who want others adoring them.  And so sad to me is this,  we are as a society, as I see it,  are becoming more tolerant  for narcissists as leaders.  And what we tend to focus on is but look at their talents,  look at what they can accomplish.  But I go, wow, they might be able to accomplish some stuff,  but the damage they do is horrific.  And so what has happened I think in our society  is when we evaluate leaders,  we're not evaluating them as the main priority being  they have to have healthy character.  What we look for is their gifts,  their ability to get things done to accomplish goals.  And as soon as we make that the main criteria,  we set ourselves up to have a leader  who's a narcissist who eventually do a ton of damage.  Now let me bring it to complex trauma and the abuse of power.  And I've already kind of touched on this.  I just wanted to begin to develop it a little bit more.  Children are born with an innate trust  for those in authority that they're gonna meet their needs,  that they're gonna keep them safe, protect them.  When somebody in authority over them abuses that power,  what they are doing is not using their power  to bless the weak ones under them,  to serve the weak ones under them.  What they're saying is I'm the boss, I get what I want  and you better get in line.  And so that is the abuse of power  that often happens within complex trauma,  that the parent uses their position of power  to be self-centered.  Now what happens inside a child  who's growing up with the abuse of power?  Well you can imagine they're feeling rejection,  they're feeling that this person doesn't want to try  to understand them, so they feel very alone,  misunderstood, hurt, but then they're angry  at how they're being treated.  They're experiencing injustice, anxiety, depression.  They feel at times it's their fault,  so they must be a bad person, shame.  All of that is going on.  And so what is happening in this child  is they love and hate their parents at the same time.  There's this growing split inside of the child  that still loves them and wants a relationship with them  but is developing a resentment  and a hatred towards them.  And so what a child then will do  with all of that hurt and anger inside  is really dependent on the child.  Some children will begin to act out right away.  They will find kids at school who are weaker and bully them.  They will hurt animals, they will hurt objects,  they will punch things, write on things.  Then some who can't do that  because they're not strong enough physically,  they develop a heart for the underdog.  They're there to protect those who are abused.  They begin to take up causes to protect people  from bullies and the abuse of power.  They bend over backwards to take care of pets  that have been abused.  Others, vow, I will never be like my dad.  I will never be like my mom.  But sadly, what happens for many  is they end up becoming their dad.  They end up becoming their mom.  And it is such a painful thing when they realize  I've become an abuser of power.  So the question I ask is,  why did they, when they hated the abuse of power,  end up abusing power?  So let me give you some reasons  and they come out of complex trauma.  So the first is, it's just the way that we grow up  and are influenced by our environment.  By what is our normal?  We are influenced by our parents  so a child that sees dad use his power to get his own way.  Dad, who when a child is defiant,  instead of trying to understand the child  just says, you better smart enough  and respect me and do what you're told.  They're absorbing all of that.  They're developing brain circuits  that correspond with how mom and dad handle situations.  And then when they grow up in our in a position of power,  they just go to that place in their brain  and they start without even realizing it,  acting the way their dad did,  responding the way their mom did.  It's just the power of a parent's influence  in shaping a child.  But there's a second reason.  What happens for a lot of people in complex trauma children  is they have to run around trying to take care of the parents.  Dad's angry, I need to go and make him happy.  I need to do extra chores.  Mom's sad and depressed.  I need to run around and do stuff for her.  And so they become the parents  and the parents become the children.  And so here are the children not able to explore life,  not able to be curious and just enjoy life and be carefree.  Now they are super responsible.  They have to give up their needs.  They have to make sacrifice after sacrifice  to take care of this family.  And without realizing it,  what happens for many of them  is when they finally get in position of authority,  they go, oh, finally I can take care of me.  Finally I can live out my childhood and do what I want.  And without even realizing it,  they now use their authority to be selfish,  all because they didn't have a childhood.  And then there's a third reason  that comes out of complex trauma.  And that's shame.  So a person with shame is afraid of being exposed  for how weak they are, for how bad they are,  for how not valuable they are, so they like to hide.  So when a person gets to a point of leadership  or having power, if somebody challenges them,  somebody disagrees with them, that triggers their shame.  Oh, oh, people might see I'm a fraud,  people might see that I don't have what it takes.  So they go to, you better do it, you're told,  I'm the boss around here and they abuse their power.  But it's really a shame issue.  Or they're afraid to ever admit they're wrong.  They always have to be right  because they think if they admit they're wrong,  that people will see them as weak.  That's a shame issue that comes out of that.  Or for some of them, when they were growing up  and their shame was triggered,  they felt humiliated, people laughed at them,  people made fun of them.  And so to show weakness meant humiliation.  And so now if they admit they don't know how to do something  or that they were wrong, they're afraid  that they're gonna get humiliated.  Now what I want you to see is in their mind,  they don't understand the difference  between true humility and humiliation.  Because for them, true humility means you admit you're wrong,  but always in their mind that meant  then you're gonna get humiliated.  And so they resist true humility,  which I should say is a key ingredient  for not abusing power, but they resist true humility  because they're pretty sure it's gonna result  in getting humiliated, which again is another shame issue.  Another thing that comes out of complex trauma  is that often children in complex trauma  have no control over their environment.  There's chaos, there's abuse, there's neglect  and they can't do a thing about it.  So when they finally get to a position of power,  now they can control their world.  And they get a taste of how good it feels  to control their world, that they become addicted  to that power and never wanna give it up.  And so they abuse their power.  For some to get to a position of authority  can awaken narcissist tendencies  that have been there all along,  but have never had an arena or opportunity  to express themselves.  But now in a position of power,  something triggers narcissistic tendencies.  So now, position of power you say,  I'd like to do this and everybody says, okay.  And you go, wow, I like the feeling of that.  And then people naturally respect you  because of your position, they obey you.  They do what you want them to do.  And then you ask them to do favors.  And they do favors for you, they make sacrifices for you.  And all of a sudden you realize, you know what?  They're doing 90% of the sacrificing  and I'm once in a while 10% sacrificing  but I kinda like this type of relationship.  That's a narcissistic tendency.  And then when things go wrong,  oh, I can blame somebody else and nobody disagrees with me.  And so for some people without realizing it,  they get to a position of power  and it's like another person starts to come out.  That is very unhealthy and ends up abusing power  and they didn't even see it coming.  So let's go to healing, how do we change this?  Because if you've grown up in complex trauma,  you've grown up with the abuse of power.  You know how hurtful it is.  You've experienced all those hurts.  Most of you aren't gonna wanna do that to your children.  Most of you are not gonna wanna do that  if you're in a position of leadership  in an organization.  So how can we have power but use it to bless and not hurt?  So first of all, I hope you realize  you have to again heal shame.  Because as long as there's shame,  a position of power will probably be abused  because of your shame issues.  So keep dealing with shame.  Secondly, grow in humility.  True humility with safe people  always results in connection,  in growth, in healing.  So grow in humility.  People need a leader with humility.  And that is the way that you prevent the abuse of power  is to have true humility.  Third, if you get in a position of power,  stop regularly and ask yourself  if there are any double standards happening.  Are you expecting people to treat you with respect  but you're not treating them with the same respect?  Are you expecting people to make sacrifices for you  but you're not making the same sacrifices?  And are you being patient with the most vulnerable?  You realize that if you are working with people  who are coming out of complex trauma,  people who don't have a whole lot of healthy tools  in their toolkit, their growth is gonna be similar  to that of a toddler.  It's gonna be messy, it's gonna be slow.  And they're not gonna be able to run as fast as you.  And so you have to be patient with them  in that slow messy process of growth.  And if you're not, then there's a double standard  and you're going to be hurting people.  Next, have someone in your life that you respect  that you're accountable to about your leadership  about how you use power,  somebody that can get in your face  if you are operating by a double standard  or abusing power in any way.  Next, if you're in a position of power,  take time to get to know the people under you.  That is so important.  Many leaders just want people to obey them,  but people don't want to obey you unless you care about them.  And the way they know you care about them  is that you get to know them.  It is so key.  Next, consciously do things to sacrifice for others,  sacrifice for others, to serve others  so that you never get to a point  where it's just people serving you  and you don't serve anybody.  And then consciously have times  when other people disagree with what you would like to do  that you do what they want, not what you want.  That prevents the abuse of power.  And then regularly do a self-evaluation  on not whether you're attaining your goals,  but how well you're doing it serving those under you,  at caring for them, at meeting their needs.  Often leaders just do evaluations on,  have I met my five-year plan?  No, do evaluation on how am I doing it  loving the people under me?  Well, that's the end of part one.  I hope it helps you.  I hope that as you grow in your recovery  and as you move into volunteering and service,  that this will help you not fall into abusing any power.  We're gonna take a short break  and then we're gonna come back for the Christian part.  If you're not interested in that, not a problem,  you're free to go.  We'll see you next Friday for everybody else.  I'll be back in just a minute.  Okay, welcome back.  We've been going through the life of Peter.  And today I want to just kind of do a parallel  to what we've been seeing in Peter's life,  just to fill out your thinking a little bit further.  What we've been seeing is that God has said to Peter,  Peter, I want you to basically start a new religion,  but it's going to be different than the Jewish religion.  The Jewish religion has become quite distorted.  It's not having the priorities that I designed it to have.  So I want you to lead this new religion in a new direction  that's in keeping with my priorities.  And so that has been what Peter has done.  And the parallel to us today is that when you're in recovery,  you're coming out of a life where you're headed  in one direction, but now you're gonna go in a new direction.  And like Peter, you're gonna get up some opposition.  Opposition from family, even,  opposition from people, friends that used to be with,  but there will be some type of opposition.  And then for some of you are entering into a relationship  with God, and as you grow in that relationship,  you might have people who are saying,  I don't like the direction your life is going  and you will get opposition for that.  So what I want to do is go back to the book of Job.  And Job is referred to in the first chapter  as the most godly righteous man in the whole world.  And it's important to understand that  because it's God's evaluation of Job  that there's nobody more righteous than him.  Well, Satan comes along and he concludes  that the reason Job follows God  so wholeheartedly is because God has made his life easy.  God has blessed him with so many wonderful things.  And he's convinced that if all of those good blessings  were taken away, that Job will go,  I'm not gonna follow God anymore.  And so God gives St. Bermission  and he loses, Job loses everything.  His wealth, his health, his children, it's all gone.  After a period of time, it becomes obvious  that Job isn't gonna turn from God like Satan thought he would.  He's not gonna curse God.  He's still loyal to God,  even though everything in his life sucks.  Now, here's what I want you to see.  The beginning of the book, chapter one,  that's about Job losing everything.  The end of the book, Job gets everything back.  He refuses to turn against God  and God gives him twice as much back.  And that's the story of Job.  But that's only two chapters out of the book.  Job is 42 chapters.  There's 40 other chapters and you go,  well, that then must be the focus of the book.  So the rest of the book, the 40 chapters  is about Job's four friends who come initially to comfort him.  And they're godly people.  They love God and are following God.  So here's the big picture of it.  Those four friends grew up in a society  that basically thought they had figured out Job's situation  and why it was happening to him.  And their explanation was this.  If you obey God, God will bless you.  If you disobey God, God will send bad things  and life will be painful.  So Job, before you were the wealthiest person around,  you had all kinds of blessings.  That's because you were following God.  Now you've lost everything  and now you're in tremendous pain.  Man, you must have done something terrible against God.  And in their mind, that makes sense.  And so that's how they're looking at Job  as you have done something terrible Job.  And they're thinking that was the only way to look at this.  They were rigid in their thinking  and they were going to try and fit Job into that box.  They thought it was the only correct interpretation.  And so if you look at that belief system,  I'm gonna call it a box.  It's their way of looking at things.  Okay, so let me stop and say this.  Most people in complex trauma families  don't realize that their family is in a box.  There's a set of rules.  There's a way of looking at things.  There's an understanding about the world, about life.  And that's the box.  And everybody in the box agrees with that system.  Many churches have a box  and that's their way of understanding the world.  Their values, their morals, their rules, that's their box.  Sadly, for most complex trauma, that box becomes rigid.  And for some churches, that box becomes rigid.  They think it's the only right way of looking at things.  It's their right.  There's nothing that needs to be changed.  And so if somebody comes along  and they are outside the box,  their experience doesn't fit within the box.  Their belief doesn't agree with the box, then what happens?  What you would hope is that they would say,  maybe we need to rethink our box.  Maybe we need to evaluate our box.  But sadly, that usually doesn't happen.  And that's what happens with Job's friends.  Instead of saying, Job, your experience,  you're saying you haven't done anything against God,  you're saying that you don't fit within the box  that we said that good equals blessing, bad equals God taking away.  You're blessing.  You say your experience doesn't fit the box.  We're not going to reevaluate our box.  You're wrong.  And so what the rest of the book is,  is them starting very kind and nice to Job  and explaining Job, you must have done something  to sin against God.  That's why all of this bad stuff is happening.  And Job says, no, I haven't.  Then they go a second round  and they get a little bit more cruel.  Job still says, no, I haven't done anything.  Then they go a third round.  Job says, no, I haven't done anything.  Fourth round, they're trying to force Job into the box.  And because Job is refusing,  and with his integrity, he says,  to agree with their box,  they then go not to evaluate their box, they now attack Job.  And they say the nastiest things to him,  they accuse him of the ugliest possible things,  all because he would not fit their box  and they refuse to evaluate their box.  So let me take this to kind of today  and bring it into a Christian context.  As Christians, we live in a world  where kind of a tendency for most people  is there's no absolute truth.  It's whatever you want it to be.  Your truth is your truth, my truth is my truth.  And Christians come along and say, no, there is absolute truth.  And we have to hang on to absolute truth.  But from my observation,  what I think I see is that they miss a couple of things,  assumptions that they're making in doing that.  So in saying we have to hang on to absolute truth,  many without realizing it or saying,  we have to make everything black and white.  We have to be black and white with this subject,  this subject, this subject,  so that there's absolute truth.  And that is extremely dangerous.  But they think they can kind of twist the Bible  to make it support making everything black and white.  But then the second thing that happens is  they hear a preacher say, God says this,  this is absolute truth.  And they assume that that's God's meaning  and don't see it's just the preacher's interpretation.  And so God isn't necessarily saying that at all.  It's just the preacher misinterpreting  or giving his interpretation  and making it sound like God is saying that.  And so then they end up with these beliefs,  absolute beliefs, but now they have to make it rigid.  It's got to become a box.  And what they're made to think is,  if anybody challenges these beliefs,  they are drifting from God.  If anybody steps outside the box and say,  I'm not sure that's as black and white as you're saying,  or they must not be as committed to God as you are.  They must be drifting from their faith.  And so adhering to the rigid box  becomes the mark of devotion to God.  So now nobody can challenge the box.  And if somebody comes along and does that,  people aren't going to evaluate the box,  they're going to condemn that person.  And that help is happening all the time.  And so a system gets established  where people become rigid,  they close their mind to any other way of looking at things.  And now think I have to stay loyal to this box  or else I'm not loyal to God.  And for some, once they have that box,  they might have a little inkling in their gut  that something might be a little bit off here,  but they can't challenge the box.  Because if I'm wrong about this one thing,  I might be wrong about the whole box  and then what's going to happen to my faith.  So I better hang on to my rigid little box.  And so that's the world Peter grew up in.  The religion of that time was a rigid box.  Peter stepped outside of that box  and began to challenge it.  And they did not examine the box  to see if it was right, they condemned Peter.  And so God was asking him to step outside of a rigid box.  And it was going to be the experience for Peter  that Joe went through.  People who used to be friends  now come to try to change him,  his mind to get him to go back in the box.  And when he refuses to, they turn against him.  And some of you are going to get that in recovery.  You're going to get your family  when they realize you're stepping outside of their box  in order to get healthy,  who are going to try and bring you back into the box.  And when you don't come back in,  they're going to turn against you and be cruel to you.  You might get that from church  if you step outside of their box.  So sadly, the tendency of humans is to create boxes.  And when somebody's experience doesn't fit it  or they challenge it,  instead of examining their box,  they condemn the person who challenges it.  But sometimes following God means stepping outside  of a box that isn't as healthy as it should be  and walking alone, facing opposition from that box.  And if you're going through that,  I just hope Joe's experience and Peter's experience  will kind of validate what you're going through  and encourage you in your journey.  Let's pray.  Father, thank you for these experiences in the Bible.  They just show the tendency of humans.  And it just helps those who are trying to walk  a new healthy way to feel that others have gone before them  and that they get what they're going through  and that you understand it as well.  And just strengthen them and encourage them, I pray.  Amen.  Well, thank you again for being with...
