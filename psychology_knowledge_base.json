      "clinical_context": "So when you are feeling down or when you are struggling with something, that other people kind of read as do not talk to me or you might chronically mask in a way that causes you to always look upbeat and cheerful even when you are absolutely dying inside and when this is the case other people do not get the appropriate cues from you ergo they do not know how to check in with you and attune to you the way that they do to each other but this is not necessarily because they do not care about you it could be because they have no idea what is going on for you this can become a kind of spiraling problem because if you do not know how to access a lot of your emotion states and emote them to other people you might also have trouble forming close connections so this might make it into the realm of reality where you truly do have less people who are coming to you and checking in on you and vice versa because you have not learned the connecting skills that other people learned early on a key part of those being showing your emotions a little bit all of the time and of course this problem is not just about the connection skills it's about the connection skills that you have to connect to your partner and to the other person so if you are not able to connect to your partner you might be able to connect to your partner in a way that is not necessarily your own emotional connection but it is a way that you can connect to your partner and to the other person your emotions might be much bigger than the average person's especially if you have not received any support for working through that trauma so by adulthood you might be unconsciously and consciously inhibiting but the important thing here to keep in mind is just to note that we want to make sure we are giving things the right attribution so if you notice that you struggle socially more so than the average person either in terms of forming connections or just being able to connect with your partner or not so that you can actually make the most of these things as an emotional support it probably is not because you are just flawed and broken and someone who nobody would ever care to be close to it might be because there are social skills you genuinely missed learning about early on in life that make it hard for other people to know how to connect with you and this is once again something that can be worked on in the healing process but what we are looking at today is just putting everything into the right context"

      "clinical_context": "I was just curious when you had mentioned about not limping, going into your mother's room About what?  When you had mentioned about not limping going into your mother's room there's other theories about birth order and you are the oldest in the family can you isolate things off?  I think birth order you know, I have seen this chronic caregiver pattern I have seen it at a lot of places every birth order possible it's not automatically a first born phenomena, I mean sometimes it's the second child who who becomes the good kid because like with my two boys with the first son we had a lot of conflict because we are not a very adept parents so the second son pulls in and suppresses themselves more as a way of I do not want that hassle I do not want all that conflict so he becomes the peacemaker it can happen at any point so birth order does have an impact but so many other factors are playing to it so I would not isolate that one There's another question somewhere else?  I should be loud enough actually yes you are, yes I was just wondering, you mentioned bulimia I was wondering, can you elaborate on that is it addiction?  What is that?  Bulimia is a form of addiction and it arises for the same reasons that addiction arises what's that?  You know what it is it's a it's a build up of tension and an urgent release so that it's a way of actually self created it's a way of releasing tension and there's that relief addiction I define as any behavior that you crave that has a sense of relief associated with it and which has negative consequences and you do not give it up despite the negative consequences that's what addiction is bulimia is an addiction the best way to understand it is a form of addiction and the causes of it go back to exactly the same factors that would underlie addiction see there's only one story there's only one story you treat kids well they grow up to be healthy adults you do not treat them well they are going to act out their unwellness in a number of ways and all the illnesses that we have and all these diagnoses are just different forms of people manifesting early trauma and early distress that's all it's very simple yes I was just taking up on the question about bulimia how do you see anorexia anorexia is related like do you see that as being addictive or is that more in the suppressing it's well let me just formulate it for you anorexia is an attempt to be in control of something and when you do not feel your life is in control that's one way to be in control because that's something nobody can control you with so you are going to be totally in charge it's it's an emotional or it's an attempt to deal with severe emotional loss that leaves you completely helpless but in this one area of your life you are totally in charge that's how I understand it and invariably it has to do with relationships with caregivers particularly mothers I do not blame mothers because the mother is just acting out what happened to them as kids but with the kids with anorexia there's always issues and you know I know that like the singer Anne Murray I think her daughter was anorexic and what I read about them it is a self suppression on the part of the daughter I think there's a lot of anger there that's being suppressed in anorexia and that anger is being taken out on the self that's how I understand it there was a hand somewhere else yes please what about what do you think about the idea of somebody getting cancer if they have experienced repeated physical traumas that have been accidental like somebody who's had a series of accidents throughout their life that have been potentially less threatening accidents than getting cancer at a very young age and dying from it well first of all I would say that nobody has a series of accidents accidentally ok so so that for example if you have if you constantly get into accidents I mean statistically it might happen sometimes purely randomly that you know you always happen to be where the lightning strikes but you know overall people that are accident prone it does not come from the outside there's something about them where they ignore risk or they are unaware of their environment or something and that has to do with early defense mechanisms I will say more about that in my talk on ADHD which is to say that they are stressed so it would not be unusual then for them to get cancer but I do not think it's the physical injury directly that causes the cancer I think it's more the stress and even if I had a physical injury you see if you had a physical injury that's not the stress you know what the stress is let me ask you this question here some of you may wish to answer if you do not that's perfectly ok but is anybody here willing to acknowledge and you do not have to there's no pressure here that you were sexually abused as a child if that's true for you just put your hand up ok very good thank you at the very back how old were you when that happened 4 and for how long about a year and in that year who did you tell about it nobody thank you how old were you when it happened not very long a few weeks a few days even in those few days who did you tell about it nobody that's what the stress is because stress is not just what happens to us it's how we process it what you should have had to been able to do was to scream and yell as soon as anybody touched you the wrong way that's what you should have been able to do too it's just to scream and yell scream and run and ask for help the fact that you did not is not your fault by the time you were 4 and by the time you were 11 you had already learned that you were alone in the world and that there's nobody there to listen to you so it's not that you made a mistake you just simply did what any child would which is to assess the situation unconsciously and you already knew that nobody there was there to support you and there when there's no support there then you cannot express how you feel it's that suppression of the feeling and the non-expression of the stress response that actually creates the long term chronic stress so even if it's somebody with chronic accidents first of all there's reasons why they had them in the first place and in the second place they may not have had the environment where they could actually talk about their feelings and be listened to and understood and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here this is how we do stress and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here and that's how we respond without knowing anything about the particular case but this would be a general answer to your question yes ok now you have to really yell or come to the mic I have two things do you have any suggestions when we work with individuals and we know that they have tools because they use words like self-education or they know what is wrong with them but they say why bother so I think that's a good question yes do you have any suggestions on how we can work with them yes well first of all let me ask you a question all of you again I ask with a show of hands how many of you made new year's resolutions this year how many of you made new year's resolutions can I see the hands how many of you still kept them ok how many of you know what it takes to have a really good life in terms of nutrition and exercise and emotional balance and all that how many of you know what it takes how many of you are living it ok so first of all thank you first of all the person you are talking about is not that unique are they they are just like the rest of us so what I would say to that person is you know what listen to them what are they saying to you they are saying that they are discouraged they are saying that they are discouraged so just hear their instead of talking them out of it listen to them you sound really discouraged wonder what that's about for you you must feel really hopeless sometimes you know what even me I know how to live a good life but I do not do it it's just very hard really listen to them make sure that they feel validated and understood by you then they can get past it if you try to talk them out of it you cannot and again a bit louder please second point is I I am on an immunosuppressive drug right now and I kind of think maybe it's time to change my feel I mean I used to be a yes person but I am wondering when I had trauma about 5 years ago it was a major trauma that happened in our family is that and then this past year is when I started getting this immunosuppressive issue and ulcers on my leg and is that is there a timeline when it finally starts to really affect your body like so I will talk to my staff about self care how important it is and I have been doing that myself learning to say you know no I have to create new boundaries wanting to help people and that made me feel better but then I realized that I was not taking care of me right is there any suggestions on really on how to take back some of that you know and become more stronger with yourself so that you are not getting stage like I am trying to get off these drugs that I am taking today well let me tell you about a friend of mine who lives in Calgary her name is Shannon Duke and Shannon is 48 years old now and when she was 37 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer stage 4 meant that the cancer was already in her bones by the time it was diagnosed at that time she had 2 young children aged 1 and 3 and married to a well-dressed well-to-do businessman she herself was a very high functioning executive for Microsoft in Calgary and then she's diagnosed she had the perfect life, perfect marriage, perfect home of course and then she's diagnosed and healthy, physically fit always ate well and then she's diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and she has a transformation now she gets the best medical advice she can get anywhere in North America and she traveled to New York and elsewhere she got the best medical treatment and with that she was given one year to live because that's the prognosis stage 4 despite the medical treatment chances are you will be dead in one year now a year ago in February, just a year ago now Shannon traveled to the Napa Valley of California with some of her friends and they celebrated her 10th year survival and her 47th birth and the transformation that she experienced was when she was diagnosed and started paying attention she realized that her life had not been her life because she was sexually abused as a child and her response to the abuse was of course as many children will experience it cannot be about the adults, it's about me so if this terrible thing happened to me I must be a very bad person so I have to be very good to compensate and I have to be a good daughter who does not talk about it who does not disturb the waters the good employee, the good student, the good wife who does not talk about the husband's addiction issues because that would again disturb the waters and when she's diagnosed and she decides she wants to live she says to hell with all this perfection and goodness and she confronts her family over the abuse that she had endured and she confronts her husband and she starts leaving an authentic and she leaves the job by the way and she starts leaving the job by the way was not really expressing who she was 11 years later the cancer is still in her bones but it's completely inactive but she knows that if she wants to stay alive she needs to stay authentic so that I believe that many of these issues are reversible I am not promising a cure here to anybody but Shannon really underwent a major self journey and continues every day to work at it and she practices her spiritual ways which she ignored all those years and she pays attention to herself and she keeps clearing this stuff out and she is the picture of health her and I give workshops together sometimes so that there's ways to get there but it's a commitment and of course it might threaten the attachment relationships so that's always your call I am curious about any correlation with the endocrine system with a person that is either living with alcohol related birth defects and trauma so when we look at what you are presenting here about mind and body connection and the immune system so you are speaking about a lot of hormones so my question is about if the endocrine system is not developed fully because of alcohol related birth defects I do not know the effect of I am not expert enough to tell you if there's any correlation between alcohol effects and the hormonal apparatus, the endocrine system I do know that there's a correlation between trauma and the endocrine system that's what I have been talking about but I do not know the specific answer about alcohol, it's a good question I may need to look it up as long as it's finished we have got five minutes rather than take another question let me ask you to take a couple of minutes and answer the following question for yourself in what area of your life are you not saying no I am talking about where there's a no that wants to be said but you are not saying it those areas are usually work or personal relationships and I suggest you just talk to each other just tell each other at your table or a partner if you do not want to talk, write it but have a conversation with yourself or somebody else at your table about where you are not saying no in your life, that would be a personal relationship or on your job, okay just have that conversation"

      "clinical_context": "I was just curious when you had mentioned about not limping, going into your mother's room About what?  When you had mentioned about not limping going into your mother's room there's other theories about birth order and you are the oldest in the family can you isolate things off?  I think birth order you know, I have seen this chronic caregiver pattern I have seen it at a lot of places every birth order possible it's not automatically a first born phenomena, I mean sometimes it's the second child who who becomes the good kid because like with my two boys with the first son we had a lot of conflict because we are not a very adept parents so the second son pulls in and suppresses themselves more as a way of I do not want that hassle I do not want all that conflict so he becomes the peacemaker it can happen at any point so birth order does have an impact but so many other factors are playing to it so I would not isolate that one There's another question somewhere else?  I should be loud enough actually yes you are, yes I was just wondering, you mentioned bulimia I was wondering, can you elaborate on that is it addiction?  What is that?  Bulimia is a form of addiction and it arises for the same reasons that addiction arises what's that?  You know what it is it's a it's a build up of tension and an urgent release so that it's a way of actually self created it's a way of releasing tension and there's that relief addiction I define as any behavior that you crave that has a sense of relief associated with it and which has negative consequences and you do not give it up despite the negative consequences that's what addiction is bulimia is an addiction the best way to understand it is a form of addiction and the causes of it go back to exactly the same factors that would underlie addiction see there's only one story there's only one story you treat kids well they grow up to be healthy adults you do not treat them well they are going to act out their unwellness in a number of ways and all the illnesses that we have and all these diagnoses are just different forms of people manifesting early trauma and early distress that's all it's very simple yes I was just taking up on the question about bulimia how do you see anorexia anorexia is related like do you see that as being addictive or is that more in the suppressing it's well let me just formulate it for you anorexia is an attempt to be in control of something and when you do not feel your life is in control that's one way to be in control because that's something nobody can control you with so you are going to be totally in charge it's it's an emotional or it's an attempt to deal with severe emotional loss that leaves you completely helpless but in this one area of your life you are totally in charge that's how I understand it and invariably it has to do with relationships with caregivers particularly mothers I do not blame mothers because the mother is just acting out what happened to them as kids but with the kids with anorexia there's always issues and you know I know that like the singer Anne Murray I think her daughter was anorexic and what I read about them it is a self suppression on the part of the daughter I think there's a lot of anger there that's being suppressed in anorexia and that anger is being taken out on the self that's how I understand it there was a hand somewhere else yes please what about what do you think about the idea of somebody getting cancer if they have experienced repeated physical traumas that have been accidental like somebody who's had a series of accidents throughout their life that have been potentially less threatening accidents than getting cancer at a very young age and dying from it well first of all I would say that nobody has a series of accidents accidentally ok so so that for example if you have if you constantly get into accidents I mean statistically it might happen sometimes purely randomly that you know you always happen to be where the lightning strikes but you know overall people that are accident prone it does not come from the outside there's something about them where they ignore risk or they are unaware of their environment or something and that has to do with early defense mechanisms I will say more about that in my talk on ADHD which is to say that they are stressed so it would not be unusual then for them to get cancer but I do not think it's the physical injury directly that causes the cancer I think it's more the stress and even if I had a physical injury you see if you had a physical injury that's not the stress you know what the stress is let me ask you this question here some of you may wish to answer if you do not that's perfectly ok but is anybody here willing to acknowledge and you do not have to there's no pressure here that you were sexually abused as a child if that's true for you just put your hand up ok very good thank you at the very back how old were you when that happened 4 and for how long about a year and in that year who did you tell about it nobody thank you how old were you when it happened not very long a few weeks a few days even in those few days who did you tell about it nobody that's what the stress is because stress is not just what happens to us it's how we process it what you should have had to been able to do was to scream and yell as soon as anybody touched you the wrong way that's what you should have been able to do too it's just to scream and yell scream and run and ask for help the fact that you did not is not your fault by the time you were 4 and by the time you were 11 you had already learned that you were alone in the world and that there's nobody there to listen to you so it's not that you made a mistake you just simply did what any child would which is to assess the situation unconsciously and you already knew that nobody there was there to support you and there when there's no support there then you cannot express how you feel it's that suppression of the feeling and the non-expression of the stress response that actually creates the long term chronic stress so even if it's somebody with chronic accidents first of all there's reasons why they had them in the first place and in the second place they may not have had the environment where they could actually talk about their feelings and be listened to and understood and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here this is how we do stress and that's what creates the long term stress so it's the suppression that's the issue here and that's how we respond without knowing anything about the particular case but this would be a general answer to your question yes ok now you have to really yell or come to the mic I have two things do you have any suggestions when we work with individuals and we know that they have tools because they use words like self-education or they know what is wrong with them but they say why bother so I think that's a good question yes do you have any suggestions on how we can work with them yes well first of all let me ask you a question all of you again I ask with a show of hands how many of you made new year's resolutions this year how many of you made new year's resolutions can I see the hands how many of you still kept them ok how many of you know what it takes to have a really good life in terms of nutrition and exercise and emotional balance and all that how many of you know what it takes how many of you are living it ok so first of all thank you first of all the person you are talking about is not that unique are they they are just like the rest of us so what I would say to that person is you know what listen to them what are they saying to you they are saying that they are discouraged they are saying that they are discouraged so just hear their instead of talking them out of it listen to them you sound really discouraged wonder what that's about for you you must feel really hopeless sometimes you know what even me I know how to live a good life but I do not do it it's just very hard really listen to them make sure that they feel validated and understood by you then they can get past it if you try to talk them out of it you cannot and again a bit louder please second point is I I am on an immunosuppressive drug right now and I kind of think maybe it's time to change my feel I mean I used to be a yes person but I am wondering when I had trauma about 5 years ago it was a major trauma that happened in our family is that and then this past year is when I started getting this immunosuppressive issue and ulcers on my leg and is that is there a timeline when it finally starts to really affect your body like so I will talk to my staff about self care how important it is and I have been doing that myself learning to say you know no I have to create new boundaries wanting to help people and that made me feel better but then I realized that I was not taking care of me right is there any suggestions on really on how to take back some of that you know and become more stronger with yourself so that you are not getting stage like I am trying to get off these drugs that I am taking today well let me tell you about a friend of mine who lives in Calgary her name is Shannon Duke and Shannon is 48 years old now and when she was 37 she was diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer stage 4 meant that the cancer was already in her bones by the time it was diagnosed at that time she had 2 young children aged 1 and 3 and married to a well-dressed well-to-do businessman she herself was a very high functioning executive for Microsoft in Calgary and then she's diagnosed she had the perfect life, perfect marriage, perfect home of course and then she's diagnosed and healthy, physically fit always ate well and then she's diagnosed with stage 4 breast cancer and she has a transformation now she gets the best medical advice she can get anywhere in North America and she traveled to New York and elsewhere she got the best medical treatment and with that she was given one year to live because that's the prognosis stage 4 despite the medical treatment chances are you will be dead in one year now a year ago in February, just a year ago now Shannon traveled to the Napa Valley of California with some of her friends and they celebrated her 10th year survival and her 47th birth and the transformation that she experienced was when she was diagnosed and started paying attention she realized that her life had not been her life because she was sexually abused as a child and her response to the abuse was of course as many children will experience it cannot be about the adults, it's about me so if this terrible thing happened to me I must be a very bad person so I have to be very good to compensate and I have to be a good daughter who does not talk about it who does not disturb the waters the good employee, the good student, the good wife who does not talk about the husband's addiction issues because that would again disturb the waters and when she's diagnosed and she decides she wants to live she says to hell with all this perfection and goodness and she confronts her family over the abuse that she had endured and she confronts her husband and she starts leaving an authentic and she leaves the job by the way and she starts leaving the job by the way was not really expressing who she was 11 years later the cancer is still in her bones but it's completely inactive but she knows that if she wants to stay alive she needs to stay authentic so that I believe that many of these issues are reversible I am not promising a cure here to anybody but Shannon really underwent a major self journey and continues every day to work at it and she practices her spiritual ways which she ignored all those years and she pays attention to herself and she keeps clearing this stuff out and she is the picture of health her and I give workshops together sometimes so that there's ways to get there but it's a commitment and of course it might threaten the attachment relationships so that's always your call I am curious about any correlation with the endocrine system with a person that is either living with alcohol related birth defects and trauma so when we look at what you are presenting here about mind and body connection and the immune system so you are speaking about a lot of hormones so my question is about if the endocrine system is not developed fully because of alcohol related birth defects I do not know the effect of I am not expert enough to tell you if there's any correlation between alcohol effects and the hormonal apparatus, the endocrine system I do know that there's a correlation between trauma and the endocrine system that's what I have been talking about but I do not know the specific answer about alcohol, it's a good question I may need to look it up as long as it's finished we have got five minutes rather than take another question let me ask you to take a couple of minutes and answer the following question for yourself in what area of your life are you not saying no I am talking about where there's a no that wants to be said but you are not saying it those areas are usually work or personal relationships and I suggest you just talk to each other just tell each other at your table or a partner if you do not want to talk, write it but have a conversation with yourself or somebody else at your table about where you are not saying no in your life, that would be a personal relationship or on your job, okay just have that conversation"
