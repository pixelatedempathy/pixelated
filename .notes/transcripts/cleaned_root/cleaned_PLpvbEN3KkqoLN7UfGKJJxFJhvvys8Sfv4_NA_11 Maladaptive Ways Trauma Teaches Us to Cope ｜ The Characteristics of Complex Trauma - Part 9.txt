We are almost done our series on the 85 characteristics we have this week and next.  And tonight I just want to pull together some of the coping characteristics.  So we have already talked about different maladaptive coping patterns that come out of complex trauma in shame in fear.

But I just want to pull together the rest that we kind of have not covered yet that are again, the child trying to survive an unsafe environment where their needs are not met has to adapt.  Those adaptations seem to work.  They seem to keep them safe, get their needs met.

But 20, 30 years later, they begin to realize, wow, they are preventing healthy relationships.  They are hurting me.  They are hurting those I love.  They are actually mal adaptations.  So what we know is that people with complex trauma develop fairly consistent coping styles.  Everybody's a bit different.  Everybody picks and chooses their different coping styles.

But there are detectable patterns that come out of complex trauma.  So the first one is drugs and addiction and process addiction.  So drug addiction has kind of been stigmatized as this is a terrible behavior.  We look down at it.  Process addiction is also addiction and its activities.  So often those can be stigmatized.

But for some, you are actually get validated like workaholism, people pleasing.  So let me explain addiction in the light of complex trauma.  So complex trauma is a child who's living with their needs, not met and with getting hurt.  And so the result is they are in constant pain, but it's pain that they cannot resolve.  And also because their needs are not being met, there's not just pain.  There's emptiness that's there in the child.  And they cannot resolve that either.  So what happens is the brain does not like that.  The brain is never content.  Cannot relax as long as there's pain and emptiness.  And so it begins looking for solutions.  Every solution that tries is not working.

But then it happens upon usually first one of the twelve needs that seems to get met by something.  So the child that is sad, eats food, feels better.  Now the brain thinks the answer to emotional pain is eating food.  Or they find sex and they go, the answer to loneliness, emptiness is sex.  Or they fall into a relationship.  The answer to all my problems is being a relationship.  Or they find an escape.  The answer to getting out of pain, the answer to getting out of emptiness is just keep going into this escape.  And then the brain basically goes, if a little bit of food is good, then a lot must be better.  If a little bit of sex is good, a lot must be better.  So let's go overboard.

But then what's happening in all of this is they are trying to meet an emotional need with food, which was not designed to meet an emotional need.  It was designed to meet a physical need.  So it seems to work, but it's not really working.  It operates off the law of diminishing returns.  It feels good less and less and less.  It works less and less and less.  And so what does the person think?  Well, I just need more.  I just need more.  And pretty soon you end up with addiction.  So addiction is anything that I do.  Chemicals, activities that's designed to take me out of my pain, to make, take me out of my emptiness, to give me a little bit of pleasure when basically I have lived with constant pain and emptiness, to help me escape my present world, which is so painful and I cannot find a solution for.  So that can be food, sex, relationship, drugs, alcohol, gambling, shopping, online social media, video games, work, people pleasing, all of those become ways to try to solve my pain and emptiness.  There's another part that's so important with this and we have talked about it.  And that is we are driven to attach.  People with complex trauma can attach securely to individuals that they should attach to that are healthy.  And so that drive does not go away.  We are still driven to attach.  So we begin to try and find something to attach to that gives the feelings of attachment.  And once we find an activity or a chemical that gives the brain chemicals that feel like attachment, we go, I think I found a solution.  I now am getting all the feel good chemicals and it results in addiction.  So we said it before, recovery is not just about sobriety.  True recovery is about finding healthy attachment because if you do not, you keep going back to activities and chemicals that give feelings of attachment because we are driven to attach.  So that leads to just talk about sex and relationship addiction.  So most people coming out of complex trauma end up with sex addiction, porn addiction, relationship addiction, and it becomes a huge problem.  So there's a couple of things to consider here.  Number one, it's built on natural needs and dry.  So we have a natural need for relationship, for love, a drive for sex.  So these are built on healthy good drives and desires.

But we now try to use them to meet needs that they cannot meet.  We now try to form attachments with them to give the attachment feelings, but it's not healthy attachment.  And so there's an attachment element.  There's trying to meet needs that they were not designed to meet.  And so now you become addicted to sex.  You become addicted to porn.  You become addicted to relationships because they give all the feelings.  They take you out of your pain, out of your emptiness.  They seem to meet very important needs, but they end up doing a ton of damage.  So typically we talk about four addictions.  So there's the porn addiction where you are attached to pictures that give all the feelings of attachment and love without the relationship.  Then there's the romance addiction.  And that's the person who they just love the candlelight, the nice dinner, the nice music.  It does not matter who's sitting across the table.  It's the feelings that come out of the environment and the the quest conquer, the conquest.  That's what they are in love with.  That's what they are addicted to.  Then there's the relationship addiction, which comes out of shame, which I have to be in a relationship and have somebody want me in order to have any value.  So now I just chase being in relationships and then sex addiction.  So this is such a huge issue for so many people coming out of complex trauma.  Sadly, it does not get talked about a lot in treatment programs.  We talk about it quite a bit in our program because we have just realized that so many people struggle with this.  And until they begin to learn to have healthy attachments with safe people that are not sexualized, they do not begin to heal the way they should in this area.  The next coping thing that comes out of complex trauma is just the need for distractions.  And it kind of ties in with the addiction thing, process addictions.  I sometimes jokingly say that the worst punishment you can give to a person with complex trauma is to put them in a room all by themselves with nothing to do.  They do not have any distractions.  They just have to live with their own feelings and thoughts.  That just drives them crazy.  Now let me just say there is a place for kind of healthy distractions, healthy puttering, doing odd jobs, keeping busy.  There's a place for that.  I am not talking about that.  I am talking about a person who cannot sit still, who cannot just be with themself, cannot just have a relationship with themself and sit and do nothing.  They always have to be busy.  They always have to be on their phone, on social media, doing something.  It's an unhealthy need to not feel an unhealthy need to not be in the present, but to have something take them out of the present for a little while that gives them a little bit of pleasure or just distracts them from all of the emptiness and pain inside.  That leads to the next and that's escaped through fantasy.  So for some, instead of using distractions to get out of sitting in the present and being present to the present, they escaped through going into a fantasy world, to going from their present to something outside of the present in their thought life.  So they are escaping negative feelings in a fantasy world.

Now, I need to again point out that there's a healthy escape through fantasy.  So children are naturally curious.  Children are naturally creative.  Children have great imaginations.  Children like to have tea parties with friends, pretend being Cinderella.  Use our imaginations to just escape at times into what life could be.  We escape into sports and movies and reading novels, plans and drawings and potential romances, all of those things.  Those can be very, very healthy.  I am not talking about that.  I am talking about unhealthy escapes in the fantasy.  Most people do not even realize they do this.  It's their way of coping.  So a child who could not escape their physical situation, they were too little to fight or flight, often had to escape to an internal world.  Dissociate.  And many did it by escaping to a fantasy world.

But then that fantasy world was their favorite place.  And often when they cannot escape through fighter flight, and there's still nothing but pain, the brain helps them dissociate to this internal world by releasing opioids.  So that then when they get to adult life can work itself out this way.  A man or a woman meets somebody online and all of a sudden, that's all they can think about and they love it.  They just fantasize all the time about the relationship, about how much that person loves them about how beautiful they are and that becomes just their constant escape.  Or a young person who hates their life and now just spends all their time fantasizing about being a movie star, about being popular, about their career and having lots of money.  And they just escape there all the time.  Or a sexual abuse victim, so their way of coping as a sexual abuse victim was to have out of body experiences.  They could put themselves on a beach in the Caribbean on the ceiling, looking down as if it was happening to somebody else.  Now whenever they enter pain, they automatically go out of body.  They automatically dissociate.  They go somewhere else in their mind so they do not feel pain.  I once had a client who realized that as soon as they left their house every day and started walking somewhere, their mind just went to a fantasy world.  They did not even realize it was happening.  They just did not think about the here and now.  They were not present in the here and now.  They just went somewhere else in their mind.  And so many people from complex trauma begin to realize that one of their criticisms from their children, that the children say the most is mom, you are not present to us.  You are just like you are somewhere else because they have escaped so often to this fantasy world.  So an unhealthy escape then is an escape that now interferes with your abilities in the present, with your ability to be present to those you love, with your willingness to take responsibility for your actions in the present, to deal with problems in the present, to make important decisions in the present, whenever anything interferes with that being an adult.  And you just want to escape that then becomes an unhealthy escape to fantasy.  That then goes to the next one.  People from complex trauma tend to be super responsible or super irresponsible.  So the super responsible person is the person who they learned early on that if they were the hero, everybody loved them, people respected them, people liked them, people took care of them and wanted to meet their needs.  So now they had to take care of everybody else.  They had to be the best at everything.  They had to become perfectionistic.  They had to accomplish lots and lots and lots and earn love and respect.  They could not say no to people.  They had to feel responsible for other people's problems and other people's emotions.  Then and only then did people love them, like them, meet their needs.  So they had to put their needs aside, put everybody also ahead and be a hero.  Be super responsible.  And some people go that road and they can do it for a while until an adult life, they burn out, they are full of resentment towards everybody and their needs.  They cannot have intimate relationships.  Others go the other extreme and be super irresponsible.  And it's like, well, I am going to fail anyways.  People are going to judge me.  People are going to condemn me so why even bother trying.  Does not matter what I do, it always ends up in pain so do not even bother trying.  So they have so much fear of being judged, of failure, of being hurt, that they do not even want to try.

But there's another thing here.  For some people, for them to be in a relationship, meant you became enmeshed with a person.  It meant that once you get in a relationship, now you are responsible for them.  Now you have to take care of their needs.  Now you have to give up your needs.  Now you have to take care of their emotions.  So you cannot be real.  You have to get smaller and make them bigger.  That was, is there understanding of a relationship?  And they go, no, I am not going to do that.  If that's what a relationship means, then no, I am not going to be in a relationship because I just want to take care of me.  And to them, that means I can do whatever I want.  I can be super irresponsible because relationships require being super responsible and I am not going to go that route.  The next characteristic is people from complex trauma tend to be negative and critical.  Again, some are not even aware of it.

But let me explain it.  So there is an element of this that starts out very healthy.  Their situation as a child was very painful, was very negative.  They had a lot of bad things happening to them.  Their environment was not safe.  It was not positive.  And so for them to accurately see their life and their environment, they saw a lot of negative.  There was a lot to criticize.  So an accurate assessment was very negative and that was their normal.

But then they were constantly getting hurt.  There was a lot of bad things happening.  And so their brain out of a desire to protect them said, let's start looking for danger because if we can spot danger, then we can take steps to prevent getting hurt.  So now their brain was trained to not look at a situation positive and negative.  It was to walk into a room and immediately just look for negative because now when they walk into a room and there's 100 people and 99 are smiling, but one is looking at them with kind of a negative look in their eyes.  They go, okay, I just spotted danger.  So they train now to look for negative.  Another aspect here is that many children in complex trauma grew up with a parent who was very negative.  Criticized everything found fault with everything.  Nothing was ever good enough.  That was in their normal.  That was their default setting.  That influenced their thinking.  Those tapes play in their head now and they just are not negative because of their parents influence.  Then there's another element.  When complex trauma makes the child feel everything is my fault and the shame lies begin.  Shame has this powerful internal critic.  So now it does not matter what I do.  I find fault with it.  It's not good enough.  I criticize myself.  I beat myself up.  I am negative and critical to myself.  So what's important understand is that this negative and critical started as an accurate assessment.  Then it started as a way to try and protect myself.

But it begins to cause problems.  So now instead of just seeing danger, the brain begins to imagine danger.  It sees something and says, well I am not sure if that's danger or not.  That person's face is blank.

But let's just assume it's angry.  So let's jump to the worst case scenario.  And so now they use negative and critical in an unhealthy way.  Now I am running to fight or flight.  Nothing bad's happened.  There's no danger anywhere.

But I imagine danger.  Then they realize that being negative and critical might have some self-serving positive benefits.  Now I can hurt people by being negative and critical.  Now I get a sense of value by putting other people down all the time and that seems to build me up.  Now I can justify quitting anything because I just find fault with everything.  I can justify not changing because I just find fault with everything.  I can let fear keep me from ever growing and changing by just finding fault with the teacher with the program.  So being negative and critical now I can use as a weapon.  I can use to justify a lot of things that keep me from ever getting healthy.  It now becomes a tool.  And then being negative and critical I can now just project my issues on it everybody else.  So if I am very negative and critical I can just point out everybody else is negative and critical.  If I am narcissistic I can just point out that everybody else is narcissistic.  And so it helps me not even look at myself after a while.  I just find fault with everybody else.  The next characteristic is that people coming out of complex trauma tend towards being very rigid, extreme, dogmatic.  This is important to understand.  So part of living in complex trauma is there's a lot of chaos.  There's a lot of unknown.  You do not know what to expect on any given day.  So you gravitate towards wanting everything to be very rigid, dogmatic.  So then you know exactly where you stand all the time.  Also coming out of complex trauma is you feel very insecure.  Now it's important to understand security has two main components for a healthy sense of security.  So number one a child needs a safe environment.  So the parents provide safety for them.  Then the child feels secure.  They can relax.  That means an environment that's consistent.  So they know what to expect every day.

But then security, the main source of security is not the external environment.  It's attaching to a rock.  It's secure attachment to safe people who have the tools to handle the environment.  So if I have a safe attachment to mom and dad, then there can be a bunch of crap happening in my external world.

But I am secure because I know mom and dad can handle it.  So secure attachment is critical.

But what happens in complex trauma?  You are in an unsafe environment and you do not have secure attachment to rock.  So you feel very insecure.  What then does the brain do to try to build a sense of security?  Well, I do not want to attach to people because I have not found any safe people.  So let's just create secure environment.  How do we do that?  Let's become rigid, black and white dogmatic.  Let's have everything nailed down tight.  Everything the same.  And you create almost an OCD rigid routine.  And that becomes your source of security.  Or you become obsessed with knowing every possible detail so that you are never surprised by anything.  You never fail.  You always have things under control.  Or you are attracted to a rigid belief system.  Organization, religion, where everything's black and white.  Everything's lots of rules.  Lots of very rigid routines.  So you always know where you stand.  You always know exactly what you need to do.  You always feel right.  You always feel that you are doing the right thing.  You are attracted to those systems.  Now that seems to work.

But it creates problems in relationships.  You try to have a very rigid home life.  You create complex trauma in your children.  Any change in your external world triggers all of your insecurity.  If you start losing stuff or some of your rigid beliefs get exposed to be false or not as certain as you thought they were, all of a sudden your house of cards which was very secure starts to crumble.  If you built all your security and having a good house, a good routine, and that something happens in your environment where you lose your house and then you lose your routine, all of a sudden your life is super insecure.  It reveals that you are basing your security on externals only.  And that's not good enough.  The basis of true security is secure attachment that save healthy people.  So people coming out of complex trauma are often originally attracted to systems that are very black and white and dogmatic.

But hopefully they begin to realize there's some flaws with those systems and they begin to form healthy attachments.  The next characteristic is that people coming out of complex trauma tend to, once they get to a position of authority, abuse that position of authority.  So when they are not in position of authority, they are using healthy tools.  They are wonderful people to work with.  Then they get to a position of authority.  And all of a sudden you go, who is this person?  They turned into a monster.  Now they are being abusive to others.  Now they are lashing out.  Now they are unreasonable.  What is going on here?  So what I have found is that people coming into recovery begin to work on themselves and they can become wonderful people.

But if they have not healed their shame, beyond a certain point, when they get into a position of authority, it exposes a whole bunch of shame stuff.  Now they are afraid of failure.  Now they want to look good all the time.  Well, they want to be right all the time.  Now they never want to be challenged because that might expose their shame.  And so they get rigid.  They get unreasonable.  They lash out.  They get controlling.  They get abusive.  They get narcissistic.  So they do not know how to handle authority because their shame gets triggered so much by being in that position.  So the needs of others become less important now than their own needs.  So this is why for many people coming out of complex trauma, be very careful.  If you are doing well, that people will actually try to put you in positions of authority and say, oh yes, could you do this?  Could you do this?  It could be setting you up to fail.  If you have not healed your shame enough.  The next issue that comes out of complex trauma is pretty well.  Everybody coming out of complex trauma has boundary issues.  So there's two parts to boundaries.  There are boundaries that basically define what love looks like.  So a boundary is a rule that says we are not going to lie.  We are not going to cheat.  We are not going to hit others.  We are not going to steal from others.  We are not going to say unkind, hateful words.  Those are all boundaries.  That define what love looks like because they are trying to keep life healthy and keep relationships healthy.  The other part of boundaries is how close do I let you into my life?  Am I responsible for your needs and problems or not?  Am I responsible for some, but only to a degree, you are responsible for most of it?  How unmished am I?  How distant am I?  How close do I let pushy people into my life?  Can I say no to them?  Can I demand privacy?  Can I cut people out of my life?  Boundaries are all about managing relationships and the closeness of relationships and how relationships operate.  People coming out of complex trauma, they did not have either set a boundaries, modeled for them very well.  There was lots of unfair, unloving, lots of hurtful words all the time.  There was lots of violation of involvement in people's lives.  So people coming in a complex trauma, some did not have any boundaries at all.  Do whatever you want.  Others said super rigid boundaries, tons and tons of rules that there was no bends, no bend, there was no exceptions.  Others, boundaries were not about what was best for everybody in the family.  Boundaries were only about what was best for the person in authority, what they liked.  So often the boundaries were unfair for everybody else.  The boundaries were not about love.  The boundaries actually hurt other people.  The boundaries actually restricted people from having fun, having their needs met.  And so to the child boundaries and that environment were bad things.  Boundaries made life worse, more painful.  And then for some children complex trauma, boundaries were inconsistent.  One day this was the rule.  The next day that rule did not apply dependent on the parents mood.  For others, boundaries had inconsistent consequences.  So one day, if you broke the rule, this was the consequence.  Other days, if you broke that rule, different consequence, dependent on parents mood.  And then for others, some days there, if you broke the rule, the consequence was over the top.  You were grounded for a month.  You had all kinds of privileges taken away.  It was cruel.  So consequences did not match the crime.  Then for others, the family was enmeshed.  You were responsible for everybody else's emotions, everybody else's behavior.  You were not allowed privacy.  You were not allowed to have a natural bubble that said, I do not want into my space.  You did not know where you ended and where somebody else's began because you were so intertwined.  Some families said, we are so close as a family because we do everything together.

But that was actually enmeshed.  That was not healthy.  Or some families, nobody was involved in anybody's life.  Everybody just lived so long existence.  Everybody doing their own thing.  You did not know how to interact and help each other meet each other's needs.  So then many children, because all children have a natural sense of a bubble.  If somebody got into their bubble without permission, they would respond and say, no, that's my space.  That's my room.  The doors shut, stay out, demand privacy.  They would then get punished for that.  So peace in the family was only maintained not by healthy boundaries.  Peace was maintained by conforming to unhealthy boundaries.  That's what they knew.  So to be a good child meant, you had to do it dad wanted.  Even if it was not for your best, even if it was not that everybody's needs matter the same amount.  Conforming to the boundaries of the authority was all that mattered.  So boundary issues, and we do a whole week in our program on boundaries because this is such an important topic.  And so difficult to get all the nuances of boundaries sorted out in your life.  Next one, procrastination.  So many people from complex trauma struggle with procrastination.  They delay or they put off doing tasks until the last minute or pass their deadline.  Even though they know it's going to lead to even more painful consequences down the road.  They would rather have instant relief of the stress than worry about the long term consequences.  So it's important understand that in complex trauma procrastination is part of the flight response.  I cannot deal with the problem.  I do not have the tools.  I do not have the support.  I cannot deal with the stress.  So let's find a way to avoid it.  And so that became a survival skill as a way to try and deal with stress.  And so people do it still today.  Whenever they get stressed trying to avoid stress because that's where their brain goes.  You cannot deal with it.  You do not have the tools just to avoid.  So there's other reasons besides lack of tools.  Many children coming out of complex trauma procrastinate today because as a child, they are afraid to ask for help because nobody would help them.  They were made to feel like a burden or a pain.  So if I cannot deal with the problem to date and I am afraid to ask for help, let's procrastinate.  Others, there's a fear of failure.  If I do this job, I am probably going to fail.  So let's just put this job off as long as we want.  So there's that huge fear shame element because if I fail, it's going to expose how terrible I am.  So let's procrastinate.  Many are still in their limbic brain.  So all I care about is instant gratification.  Anything that's going to take work, anything that might be boring, anything that's going to be drudgery, I am going to avoid.  So let's just live instant gratification.  So as long as you are in limbic brain, you will continue to go to procrastination.  Some people procrastinated because as a child, that's how they got the attention of their parents by putting things off to the last minute by being late.  Then their parents got upset, but they connected with their parents.  Some began to rationalize that it was a good thing to procrastinate because they worked better under pressure.  And so they just procrastinate now thinking stress helps them perform better.  Some developed a fear of becoming a responsible adult.  So if I do these jobs, others are going to expect me to do these jobs and hold me to a higher standard.  So let's just procrastinate and not do them.  Others, if I accomplish tasks, I start to get noticed.  I cannot be invisible anymore.  So let's procrastinate.  Others' perfectionism, if I cannot do it perfectly, then that means I am a failure.  So if I cannot do it perfectly, procrastinate.  Others, they procrastinated because it was too hard to focus on getting a task done.  Life was so chaotic.  There was so much danger distracting them all the time that they could just never totally focus on a task.  And so it looked like procrastination all the time.  For others, life for them was always chaotic, always unpredictable.  That was their normal.  And so now they continue to kind of live that way to get healthy habits, healthy routines, to stick at tasks and do them from start to finish.  That was never part of their life.  And so they have never developed the ability to do that.  And then sadly, some were spoiled.  And so they procrastinate because somebody also do it for me.  Somebody also bail me out.  I do not have to discipline myself.  I do not have to work hard.  I do not have to do stuff I do not feel like doing because somebody else will eventually do it for me.  That was part of being spoiled.  And then if I do not do it, well, I will not go through bad consequences because somebody will bail me out of the bad consequences.  So procrastination becomes their way of life.  Others have a very strong internal critic, which basically says, does not matter what you do, I will find fault with it.  You cannot win.  So just put tasks off because I will just end up failing somehow, not doing it well enough and the internal critic will be overwhelming for me.  Others are getting to the point of burnout.  They, their sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system have been out of balance for so long that they are getting more and more tired, more exhausted, more overwhelmed that they just start procrastinating because they just do not have the energy to do tasks.  And then some fall into addiction, addiction now becomes the main focus of their life.  It consumes more and more energy and time.  Everything else gets pushed aside.  Some fall into depression.  They just lose motivation for life.  Others develop oppositional defiance disorders.  They just rebel against being responsible, against authority telling them what to do.  And so they procrastinate whenever they have to be responsible or somebody tells them what to do.  Self-sabotage becomes part of some people's life.  So whenever things are going well, they sabotage it in one way is to procrastinate, ADHD.  Many people with ADHD struggle with a poor concept or sense of time.  And so they can get doing all kinds of different things and lose track of time and it looks like procrastinating.  So procrastination is a huge issue.  And what I find so important for people to understand is that do not beat up the child that was trying to survive.  Procrastination was the only way they knew to try and avoid getting hurt.  Learn to meet with that child, care for that child, help that child learn tools to deal with life besides the tool procrastination.  Two more.  And we have talked about the next one already.  They shut down their internal alarms, their intuition, their gut, their conscience, their emotions.  So we have three alarm systems intuition.  So neuroception, we sense, get vibes when something is not dangerous.  So you have a child who you put them two people, they do not know.  They will go to one, but they will stay away from the other.  Why?  Because their vibes pick up, one is safe, one is not.  Then we have our emotions.  They are reporting back to us all the time, whether something is safe or something is not.  And then we have our conscience that is telling us if we are going into unhealthy behaviors, unloving behaviors, or we are still in healthy behaviors.  What happens in complex trauma?  You shut down your intuition, your gut, you shut down your emotions, you shut down your conscience.  Now you go into adult life with those shut down and you walk into danger.  The final one, all of the maladaptations, all of these coping things that you had to do to survive, they kept you safe, they got some of your needs met.

But now 20, 30 years later you realize you have built thousands of programs about how to cope that are actually unhealthy.

But those programs are now in your subconscious brain.  They operate on autopilot.  You are doing stuff without even being aware that you are doing it.  And again, it might give you immediate short term safety and good feelings, but long term painful consequences.  So you learn, do not be authentic, do not trust, do not be vulnerable, keep secrets, manipulate all kinds of maladaptations.  Now 20, 30 years later, that prevents a healthy relationship.  That hurts the people you love.  So recovery is bringing all of these subconscious programs to the conscious level, beginning to understand the patterns of how they operate, beginning to concentrate on changing the patterns, learning new tools.  That takes time.  That takes a lot of concentrated effort.

But it is possible.  So be aware that people coming at a complex trauma have a lot of stuff in their subconscious brain.  Programs that are basically maladaptations, recovery is changing all of those.  And that takes a lot of work.

Now, how do you get a subconscious program to the conscious level?  Sometimes you get it by learning.  And that's part of what we do in our left program.  It's tons of learning.  And that brings a whole bunch of subconscious to the conscious.

But even sometimes with all kinds of learning, there's still stuff in your subconscious.  How do you become aware of it?  This is not fun, but this is part of recovery.  It does not become conscious until it gets triggered in an intimate relationship in a life event today.  And all of a sudden, you are going along doing really well.  Something triggers a subconscious program.  You go into a world of pain.  Your brain wants to immediately go back to old tools.  You feel like you are regressing.  Do not beat yourself up.  Realize, oh, something just, I just became aware of what's this about.  Be curious about it and begin to understand.  Thank you for that trigger because it just made me aware of a program I was not even aware of before.  Now I can begin to change it.  And growth can happen.  So usually for people, the initial part of recovery, growth comes about by learning.  Later in recovery, most growth comes about my painful triggers.  We do not like that part of growth, but it is a key part of recovery.  So those are the coping characteristics that so many people have as they come out of complex trauma.  So once again, I hope this is helpful to you.  I do not want you to walk away just, oh, I am so screwed up.  This is overwhelming.  I am wanting to give you hope.  I am wanting to help you begin to realize, this is what's been happening in your subconscious.  Becoming aware of it is step one and it can feel overwhelming, but as you be applied tools, as you form healthy connections and you start to see change, you will see these characteristics begin to be less and less.  We have had clients who come back a year later and they tell us, man, first time I was here, I had all of these characteristics.  Now I have only got like 30 of these characteristics.  Yes, I still can get triggered and I am tempted to go back to the other characteristics because they are so familiar to me, but I just do not struggle with them like I used to struggle with them.  And if I do struggle with them, it's not as intensely and it does not last as long.  I can work through it very quickly and get back to a healthy place.  So growth is possible.  That's what I want you to see.  Well, that's the end of another Friday night.  Thank you again for being with us.  Have a great weekend.
