# Analysis of Refactored Neuroplasticity Layer

This document analyzes the refactored `NeuroplasticityLayer`.

## Refactoring

The original `NeuroplasticityLayer` used a `for` loop to iterate over the batch dimension when calculating the Hebbian update. This is inefficient in PyTorch.

The new `RefactoredNeuroplasticityLayer` in `ai/pixel/research/refactored_neuroplasticity_layer.py` replaces this loop with a single, vectorized matrix multiplication (`torch.matmul(reward_signal.T, x)`). This should be significantly faster for large batch sizes.

## Stability Testing

A stability test was created at `tests/ai/pixel/research/test_neuroplasticity_stability.py`. This test runs 100 iterations of weight updates with random data and reward signals and checks to ensure that the layer's weights do not become `NaN` or `inf`.

## Results

*This section will be updated after running the stability test.*
