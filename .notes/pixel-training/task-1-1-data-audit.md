# Task 1.1: Current Data Format Audit Results

## File Structure Analysis
**Total Files:** 8 JSON files + 1 summary
**Total Segments:** 2,895 training segments

### File Size Distribution
```
therapeutic_medium_quality.json: 2.1MB (908 segments)
practical_medium_quality.json:   1.9MB (834 segments) 
empathetic_medium_quality.json:  1.7MB (711 segments)
therapeutic_high_quality.json:   481KB (199 segments)
educational_medium_quality.json: 421KB (182 segments)
empathetic_high_quality.json:    98KB  (41 segments)
practical_high_quality.json:     38KB  (16 segments)
educational_high_quality.json:   9.7KB (4 segments)
```

## Schema Documentation
**Standard Segment Format:**
```json
{
  "text": "string - The actual therapeutic content",
  "style": "string - One of: therapeutic|educational|empathetic|practical", 
  "confidence": "float - Style classification confidence score",
  "quality": "float - Quality assessment score (0.0-1.0)",
  "source": "string - Source directory name (content creator)",
  "file": "string - Original filename"
}
```

## Quality Distribution Analysis
- **High Quality (≥0.7):** 260 segments (9.0%)
- **Medium Quality (0.4-0.69):** 2,635 segments (91.0%)

### By Communication Style:
1. **Therapeutic:** 1,107 total (199 high + 908 medium) - 38.2%
2. **Practical:** 850 total (16 high + 834 medium) - 29.4%  
3. **Empathetic:** 752 total (41 high + 711 medium) - 26.0%
4. **Educational:** 186 total (4 high + 182 medium) - 6.4%

## Data Quality Patterns
- **Therapeutic style** has highest high-quality ratio (18.0%)
- **Educational style** has lowest high-quality ratio (2.2%)
- **Medium quality dominates** across all styles (91% overall)
- **Confidence scores** range from ~0.5 to ~8.5

## Key Findings
1. **Imbalanced distribution** - Therapeutic and Practical dominate
2. **Low high-quality rate** - Only 9% meet high-quality threshold
3. **Educational underrepresented** - Only 186 segments total
4. **Source diversity** - 71 different therapeutic content creators
5. **Consistent schema** - All segments follow same JSON structure

## Implications for Training
- Need to balance expert training data volumes
- Consider using medium-quality segments for training
- May need to generate more educational content
- Quality thresholds may need adjustment for training effectiveness

**Status:** ✅ Task 1.1 Complete
**Next:** Task 1.2 - Research LoRA Training Format Requirements
