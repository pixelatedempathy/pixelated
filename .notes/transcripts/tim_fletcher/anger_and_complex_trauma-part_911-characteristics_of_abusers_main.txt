same thing.

I hope it doesn't get as focused this week, but I have felt the need to include in this anger series this topic of abuse because so many of you have experienced it, and my concern is a lot who have experienced it haven't yet processed it, so they've grown from it.

They're still kind of stuck, afraid to go back and look at this very painful part of their life.

So I want to begin tonight by just asking a very simple question.

Why is it that some people become abusive?

And it's an important question to ask, and there's two very critical pieces in answering that.

So number one is that everybody who's an abuser has a lot of shame.

That is almost a given in my mind.

So what happens with shame, which comes out of complex trauma, is when mom or dad abuse me or neglect me or abandon me, the child concludes it's my fault.

It's because I'm not good enough.

I must be a bad person.

So your whole sense of identity is shaped to be a negative.

What happens with people with that is nobody likes to live just walking around hating themselves and feeling that.

And so people compensate or respond to shame in a variety of different ways.

After this anger series, we're going to do a whole series on shame to really develop that and explore that.

And just to give you a heads up, it'll be heavy, but I hope a very healing series for you.

But what happens with that is that people compensate by going to I'm better than everybody.

And then what happens with that is they go, my needs are more important than everybody else's as well.

So you get the formation of a narcissist.

And then there's a fear that they don't want to acknowledge that they deny.

And that is deep down, they still believe that you wouldn't want to stay with me if I gave you a choice.

That you would probably find somebody better than me.

So the only way you're going to stay with me is if I control you.

So you can see right in there, you have an abuse element developing.

Because if you rebel against my control, then I'm going to have to use abuse to try to regain control.

And the other piece with shame is shame, though people might not be aware of it or acknowledge it.

Shame has a lot of impact on you.

And that's why I'm going to talk about shame.

Shame has a huge anger component.

You're angry at yourself, you're angry at the world, you're angry at life, and you lash out at people who are the closest to you.

So that becomes the formation of an abuser.

A lot of shame.

But you have to look at the flip side.

And that is why do certain people stay with abusers or get attracted to abusers?

And the answer is, they have the same shame.

And deep down, they respond in a different way.

And they go, nobody would ever love me a lot for who I am.

So I have to become content with getting a few crumbs of love once in a while.

That's probably the best that I can do.

So if I'm in a relationship where I'm abused, but I get love once in a while, I'll just have to put up with that and accept that because that's the best I'm going to get.

So you get the two sides of shame that get attracted to each other and end up in a relationship.

And both are necessary to keep the relationship going.

Do you realize if the person who takes the abuse and says, I'm content with a few crumbs, they could have left many, many times, but they stay there.

And the question is why?

And it's the shame thing.

Only the flip side of it.

The flip side of the response to shame.

The next thing goes like this.

I work with addicts every day.

And the question I often want them to consider is, if you look inside of yourself, you are a whole bunch of desires and hormones and chemicals and needs.

And those needs and desires and drives are all in competition with each other.

So you got a desire for something.

You got a desire for food, for sex, for relationships, for position, for power, all in competition.

Okay?

In a healthy person, there's one drive, one need that trumps everything else, and that is love.

So I will have a sex drive, but never to the point where it violates love.

Love will trump that.

What happens in an abuser is things begin to change.

They trump love.

And as soon as something begins to trump love, you can become an abuser.

And so we all have the potential to be abusive because we all struggle every day with competing desires.

And sometimes they do trump love.

We get selfish.

An abuser is the things that consistently trump love are there all the time.

And so that becomes the main part of love.

And so that becomes the main part of their life.

Love still pokes out once in a while, but other forces are the more powerful forces in their life.

So let me give you a couple examples.

So if a person has this sex drive, it can become a lust thing.

If it trumps love, guess what you have?

I want my sex drive gratified.

I don't care if I hurt you.

So now you get sexual abuse and rape.

That is where the sex drive has trumped love.

And so then sex then becomes abusive.

It becomes using of other people.

Second one, greed.

We all have this desire.

I want money.

I want position.

And so what happens if your desire for money trumps love?

I will steal from you.

But if it's healthy, I will love will always win over you.

I will love you.

I will love you.

But if it's not healthy, I will have a desire for money.

And I will never violate you.

I will never use you or steal from you.

Same as lust for power.

Think of image.

If you grew up in a home where image was more important than anything else, when you went out in public, you knew that mom and dad weren't really loving you.

That was all fake.

But you had to keep an image.

And if you didn't maintain the image while you were in public, the image while you were out there in public, you got it when you got home.

Because what your parents were saying is, my image is more important than loving you.

So if you don't maintain my image, I will hurt you.

So it overpowered love.

The same is true with resentments.

If we let them take over, they will begin to overpower love.

So I can have a hurt, be hurt by somebody else, and be angry, but if I'm healthy, I will not ever use my anger in a way to hurt you.

Love will win.

I will be respectful.

I will work my anger out in a loving way.

But if I give in to resentment, I want to hurt you.

I don't care about love anymore.

Then shame.

If you think of being with an abusive person who's got lots of shame, what happens is if you ever, if you ever, expose in public their weakness, or make them look bad, you're going to pay for it.

Hiding shame is their highest priority.

And so you can take comfort, ease, control.

If those are your priority that overpowers love, you will end up being abusive.

So if you get all kinds of those things, then you become even more likely to become abusive.

So, if anything trumps love, and that thing becomes threatened, I become abusive.

So that's the underlying forces.

So part of why I want you to think about this in these terms, is some people's response to people who are abusive is, just stop doing it.

As if that's supposed to make them just stop doing it.

The reality is, they can't stop doing it till they deal with their shame, and they deal with their shame, until they get those other things that have trumped love, to be under love.

And that doesn't happen overnight.

So dealing with abuse, is not just quitting, it is dealing with deep, deep issues that go back a long way.

And so for most people, dealing with those issues is a gradual, slow process, but it is absolutely essential.

The next thing, that I want you to realize, is the more things that you have in your life, that trump love, the more of a narcissist you are.

Because what narcissism says, is my needs, my priorities, trump you every time.

And so that is again, the subject of these competing priorities, and whether we reign them in, or give them power, because as soon as we give them power, over love, we become a narcissist who abuses.

So those are two key underlying things, as to why a person becomes an abuser.

Second thing, what characterizes an abuser?

So, how can I spot one?

Now, let me just say this up front.

I can go through this list, and I believe there's 19 things in this list, and you can know this all in your head, and you can go and fall in love with a jerk, and ignore everything I say.

You can go, yep, he's got all 19, but I'm still going home with him.

So just knowing this list, doesn't stop you from choosing an abuser.

You have to deal with your shame stuff, before you have the strength to resist this list.

So, first thing, is abusers don't come and show their true colors on day one.

They come wearing a very well crafted, well crafted mask.

And they are great at being a salesman, and fooling you, and selling you on a fantasy, phony product, and making you think it's real.

And so part of the journey in spotting an abuser, is not getting sucked in by the salesman, waiting long enough until that mask slips a little bit, and you see the true colors, and then you go, nope, not going any further in this relationship.

So they start charming, and so they can build up your self-esteem.

They sense you have shame, and what do they do in their salesman role?

They tell you how wonderful you are.

They tell you how much they adore you.

They want to spend every minute with you.

Now understand this, that's only for the first few months.

Then after that, that begins to change.

The second thing is, they will try to rush you in the relationship.

You're saying, I got to go slowly here to see their true colors.

They go, I can't let them go slowly, because my salesman act only lasts so long.

So I got to rush it here, and put pressure on them, and usually the thing that they lean on, to try to get you to speed stuff up, is sex.

If I can get them in bed, and we have great sex, then I can get them to speed things up.

So what they are actually doing, is grooming you, and what we mean by that, is they are breaking down your natural caution, and your natural hesitance to trust somebody new.

They're breaking that down, to get you to trust too early.

And so that's what we call grooming.

Once they start to get you, and you're starting to get, you're starting to show interest in them, they will then begin to try to isolate you, from your other supports.

So they want to be the only person in your life, that carries influence with you.

And if they see your parents still carry a lot of influence, and friends carry a lot of influence, they will begin to try to isolate you from them.

Now they won't come up right away and say, your parents are jerks, your friends are jerks, I want to dominate.

They go, why do you need them?

You've got me, we're great together.

We help each other.

We don't need those other things.

And you like hearing that, and you get sucked into that.

So that has a bigger thing of control.

You'll see them more and more, wanting to control everything in your life.

Your activities, your time, who you see, when you see them.

Control begins to take over.

They want to check your phone, check your Facebook.

All of that control just keeps going up and up.

Then you'll see jealousy going up and up.

So at first they won't reveal jealousy, but jealousy becomes the beginning of the mask starting to slip.

Because that will show how angry they can become, how controlling they can become, and that begins to happen.

Then disrespect comes.

Disrespect will start to happen.

So at first in the salesman role, they sound like they respect you more than anything else in the world.

But once the jealousy and control starts to build, they start taking shots at you.

Put downs.

Things that make you feel stupid.

Things that make you feel like a burden.

That you're lucky that they're so patient with you.

And then that can begin to go into public, public things that they say around other people where they put you down in front of your friends or your family.

So that begins to happen.

Manipulation, emotional abuse.

So they turn often into little wee boys and girls who pout, have temper tantrums, give you the silent treatment, withhold affection from you.

All part of a manipulation game.

Next characteristic.

They don't respect your boundaries.

They want you to respect their boundaries, but they think they can do whatever they want as far as your time, your phone, showing up, taking all your time.

Your no doesn't mean no to them.

Lack of respect for boundaries.

They will get more and more critical.

So again, let me say, you're not going to see this till you endure or get past the salesman stage.

Once you get past that, these things start coming up.

Now the problem with the critical, it will get to a point where it doesn't matter what you do, it will never be good enough.

So that then means they will criticize everything.

Everything, nothing will please them.

They will become a victim.

So not just a little boy or girl, but now they blame everybody for their problems.

They blame others for their decisions.

They don't own any of their own choices.

So if they lose their job or they lose their temper, it's your fault, it's somebody else's fault, it's never their fault.

Double standard.

I can go through your phone, you can't go through mine.

I can get angry, you can't.

I can cut you off from your friends, you can't cut me off from my friends.

So you'll see, double standard more and more.

Then you'll start to see inconsistencies, mood swings.

Happy, angry, in a heartbeat.

We're having a great day together till you're being punched in the face in a heartbeat.

So that begins to happen.

So in the salesman mode, you got a consistent sales job.

The mask never fell off.

Now you're starting to see it slip regularly.

And their true self comes out.

Now the danger for people is this.

They think the sales job was the true them and the slipping of the mask that's coming out, they think that's the exception.

Oh, they're just having a bad day.

And you make excuses for them.

The reality is the sales job was the mask.

Now it's slipping and you're seeing the real.

But that is hard to believe when you've had a month or two of a great sales job.

Then you find them emotionally unavailable.

You try to connect.

You try to work things out.

And they're just not doing it.

And so you feel more and more detached, more unable to connect all the time.

Next, they use love as a tool and a weapon.

So in the beginning in the sales job time, they acted like they loved you, but it was just really they were using love to use you.

It wasn't a genuine love.

Now they can withhold love to get you coming running.

They can even say that when they punish you, that's them loving you.

So they try to make pain equals love or hurt equals love.

So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.

So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.

So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.

Hypersensitive.

Again, the little child, the little boy, you try to give any feedback and they just get defensive.

They begin to think you're just criticizing me, out to get me.

Everything is bugging them.

And so what they're doing is basically they're like, the whole world's against me and I'm an army of one.

And now you're against me too.

And they polarize everything that way.

And they polarize everything that way.

And now you're against me too.

You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.

You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.

You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.

They always expect you to read their mind, to do everything perfectly, to communicate perfectly, all of that.

And it's just the bar is unattainable.

Insincerely repentant.

They vow they'll never hit you again.

But I want you to realize this, they will, unless they deal with that deep stuff.

Just saying I will never do it again and promising and being full of remorse in that crisis moment doesn't mean deep change has happened.

So what you're looking for is not just words, but are they willing to do deep change and reach out for help around their deepest issues.

Intimidating and threatening will happen more and more, as you begin to realize their mask has totally slipped.

This is the real them.

I think I better leave.

Then they can threaten you to kill you if you ever leave them.

Final one, they lump together morally wrong behavior with human limitation.

So if you spilled the milk, that's just as bad as telling a lie.

If a child colors outside the lines, they make that as a moral rule.

A failure.

So if you come home and the supper's not quite perfect, they make it sound like you just cheated on them.

They lump everything into a moral failure.

If the house is a little bit messy, it's like you cheated on them.

And so everything gets made into a moral thing.

So 19 things there.

You may have just checked off every one of your ex's characteristics.

Hopefully you'll pay attention the next time Prince Charming shows an interest in you.

Okay.

Next question.

We've kind of covered some of it.

Why do people stay?

I have had so many people come to me with bruises on their face saying I'm never going back.

They move out, and guess what?

Two weeks later, they're back.

And so I go, what are the dynamics that cause a person who's got bruises all over to go back for more of the same?

So two categories here.

The first for many, and what I want to say, big picture with this, I will not try to oversimplify this and make it look like the person who stays is a failure or I'm shaming them in any way.

I've been at this long enough to know that it is not easy to leave.

There are all kinds of forces at work, and it's a very complicated, complex issue.

So I hope I can communicate it in a way that you realize you're not being judged, but you're being understood.

So number one for many people is there's a huge fear of what the abuser will do if they leave.

The safety issue.
