I have had so many parents say, I do not want my kids to end up like I did.  I do not want my kids to follow the same road that I did.  And 20 years later, their kids are following the same road and end up where they were trying to prevent.  People actually create what they fear.  So fear causes them to try to avoid certain things and try to prevent certain things from happening.

But without realizing it, what actually then happens is you create the very thing you are trying to avoid.  You create what you fear.

Let me give you a couple examples of that.  You look at a child who was not validated.  They hate that they were not validated.  They never want to be not validated.  They try so hard to be validated.  And what actually happens is they end up creating.  They end up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them because they demand a validation.  They are always looking for the spotlight.  They are always needy.  And so they are not being validated, created this huge fear of never being validated, created all of these systems to try to get validation.  And what happened?  They ended up creating an environment where nobody wants to validate them.  They created what they feared.  Or take a person who was abandoned.  They never want to be abandoned again.  Because it hurts so much.  So they develop all kinds of systems, which we talked about last time, to not be abandoned again.  And what then happens?  They get needy.  They test people all the time.  Everybody gets tired of it and they abandon them.  So they create what they fear.  I have dealt with so many clients that said, as a young person, I will never be like my dad.  I hate my dad.  Or I will never be like my mom.  And now 20, 30, 40 years later, they go.  I am just like my dad.  How did that happen?  Somehow I created what I feared.  Or people coming out of a relationship.  I will never end up with another husband or wife like the one I just had.  And then five years later, they are in another relationship and they go, this is just like the last person.  Different face, same issues.  How did I end up there?  So why does this happen?  So first of all, there's a hyper need that comes out of complex trauma.  So that child who was abandoned, that child who was not validated, they have this huge need to not be abandoned, this huge need to be validated.  So now what happens to the child that has this hyper need to be validated?  Now they just seek attention all the time.  And this hyper need causes people to go, whoa, boundaries.  I am not giving you that validation that you need.  I am not giving you that validation that you need.  I am not giving you that validation that you need.

But there's a hyper need to be validated.  And so this is the reason why you should seek attention all the time.  Think of the child that was never heard.  They now have a hyper need to be heard.  So now when they are with people, they over talk.  And what happens?  People go tired of listening and they stop listening and the child does not feel heard again.  Or the child who is never understood.  They now have a hyper need to be understood.  And so they over explain everything.  And what happens?  People get tired of listening.  And the child goes, oh, I do not know.  I do not know.  Child feels not understood again.  Or the child who felt was made to feel stupid all the time.  And so now they have this hyper need to be respected for their intelligence.  And so now every relationship they are in, every situation, they have to give their opinion.  They have to let people know how smart they are and people start tuning them out and they are made to feel stupid again.  So hyper need turns people off.  And so you end up creating the very thing you are trying to avoid.  There's another part to this.  So what happens for many people in complex trauma is they had to turn off their intuition or their radar systems.  So think of the child who they are with their uncle.  Their gut tells them their uncle's not safe.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  They try to pull them out of their comfort zone.  Away from their uncle's attention.  Their mom and their dad say, hey, what are you doing?  Spend time with your uncle.  Your uncle is wonderful.  They are forced to shut down their gut.  If they listen to their gut, it just causes more internal tension that nobody's going to listen to.  Nobody's going to respect.  So just ignore their gut and go with their uncle.  And then they get molested.

But they have trained themselves to shut down their gut.  Their intuition, their gut.  And so now what happens is they go into adult life.  They go into dangerous situations with dangerous people.  Their gut, their intuition is trying to tell them this is dangerous.  And they have ignored their gut for so long, they do not listen to it.  And they end up recreating the very thing they hated in childhood.  Another part to this is when you have been in unhealthy situation, you are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  So you have been with a narcissist as your dad was a narcissist.  Your mom was a narcissist.  You could not get away from that.  They were toxic.  They were cruel.

But you learned to live with it.  You learned how to manage it.  You learned how to survive with a narcissist.  You lived with that every day.  That became your normal.  That became your skill set.  That feels right.  Now without realizing it.  Though you hate narcissists, when you get into adult life, you are actually attracted to narcissists because it feels normal.  Something in your brain goes, I know what to do with this.  I am attracted to it.  And so you end up back where you were trying to avoid the thing you hated.  There's another piece here that's very subtle.  And it's when you begin to realize that complex trauma is having to do with the fact that you are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  You are not going to listen to it.  Two authorities in your life usually who have a powerful, powerful influence over you.  So their emotional world, their value system, their belief system, how they handle situations, how they respond in all kinds of situations.  You are picking up.  You are learning without even realizing it.  Kind of like osmosis.  How to deal with life because they are your role models.  And you, your brain, is constantly learning by watching and observing them.  So now they could have been programming you, training you to be very unhealthy in how you respond to situations.  You hate it because you got hurt, but their influence over you, how they trained you, how they indoctrinated you, your brain just learned all kinds of tools.  So now in adult life, you just automatically do those tools.  You automatically adopt those viewpoints.  You automatically adopt those perspectives, those biases, and you end up in the very same place.  There's another thing that causes this.  So many people coming out of complex trauma fall into wrongly diagnosing why they are experiencing pain in adult life.  And when they wrongly diagnose, then they come up with the wrong solution.  So if they are disrespected, they conclude the reason is because they must be different.

Therefore, I need to wear masks.  So they conclude I am the bad.  That's why I am disrespected.  They do not see it as the other person's problem.  So they actually see shame.  They believe shame lies.  They see the solution then as wearing masks.  So they got the wrong diagnosis that I am the problem.  They got the wrong solution, wear masks.  Never say no.  Be a people pleaser.  All of that.  And so that initially seems to work.  It seems like I diagnosed it right because I got the right solution.  People like me now.  I do not get disrespected anymore.  What you do not realize is by being a people pleaser, by wearing masks, people see through that and they lose respect more and more for you.  So you are trying to avoid disrespect.  You wrongly diagnosed, came up with the wrong solution, seemed to work, but it actually led to greater disrespect in the long run.  So there's a pendulum swing.  You get it also with people who grew up with a dad who was a military general and he just autocratic rules, harsh discipline, no nurture, no love.  Everything was conditional.  You go, I will never be like my dad.  I am going to go to the opposite and I am going to be super kind to my kids.  Let my kids make their decisions all the time.  Accept them however they are.  And it looks like I am never going to end up with my kids hurt like I was hurt.

But what happens is your dad's issue was shame.  Your issue is shame.  Your dad did not care if you liked him.  You want your kids to like you so much.  Your shame worked out in different ways, but it was shame still running the ship and your children get hurt because you do not set proper boundaries.  You do not help them the way that you need to learn to be responsible, your kids get hurt again.  Then there's a self-fulfilling prophecy.  So just think of it this way.  Your experience with unsafe people said that being authentic always results in getting hurt.  So you developed a belief that you thought was the truth, which was actually a truth only because it was with unsafe people.  Whereas the truth about healthy living is authenticity with safe people always leads to intimacy.  For you, authenticity always leads to hurt.  So never be authentic.

But you developed expectations that whenever you get in a relationship, if you try to be authentic, you will get hurt.  So what do you do?  You go into life based on that belief, those expectations.  You get into relationships and you go, I will not share myself.  I will not be authentic because that will result in being rejected.  That will result in being abandoned.  That will result in being hurt.  I will try to be invisible.  I will put my needs aside.  And you come up with all kinds of behaviors that come out of those expectations and beliefs.  And what happens?  The other person goes, I cannot have a relationship with you because you are never authentic.  You never open up.  You are emotionally unavailable.  And they leave you.  You get hurt because you were operating off the wrong beliefs out of your complex trauma experiences.  A couple more.  Growth and change create a desire to return to the old ways.  Or another way, words, growth and recovery and changing positively in recovery actually creates fear.  And that causes people to want to return to the old ways.  So let's talk about the old ways.

Let me just briefly give you what is known as a transformational model of change.  So it starts with stage one, the status quo.  So that's where you are in your default setting, which is unhealthy.  So you are being controlled by emotions that you resulting in behaviors that you know are not healthy.  You take the path of least resistance.  Whatever seems easy and gives you instant gratification.  I am going to do it.  I do not care about long term consequences.  And so you start to slide into this rut, this inertia where it's just easier to stay here than to get out of it.  What gets you out of that?  What becomes the status quo?  That rut.  You need the second stage, a foreign element.  You need something painful, a person or event to come along and create so much pain that you go, it's no longer worth staying here.  I need to change.  So somebody has said addict seldom get sober because they see the light.  It is usually because the heat gets too hot.  So we do not change usually unless life gets painful.  Unless we are forced to change.  Okay, so you are going along status quo.  Life gets really painful, you decide to change life, all of a sudden starts improving.  You get your job back your relationship back your kids back.  You start to feel better about yourself.  You go, this is worth it.  Life is really, really good.  I am glad I changed.

But then something happens.  So a whole bunch of things start to happen in the early months of recovery after the positive benefits of recovery were experienced.  So number one, you are stepping into the unknown.  You knew what it was to be unhealthy.  Now you are trying to figure out how to be healthy.  This is brand new territory for you.  And that triggers your fear of the unknown.  That requires changes that push you into areas that are scary.  That unknown, new skills, all these changes makes life feel a bit chaotic.  You feel vulnerable.  You feel a little bit powerless.  You cannot predict what's going to happen.  And you do not like that feeling.  Or these changes do not feel natural.  They feel like I am faking it.  They do not feel like the real me.  They are very uncomfortable.  I do not like these feelings of discomfort.  So what I want you to see is that these changes, though positive, are increasing your stress because you are learning new skills.  So your stress is going away.  They are increasing your fear because you are in change in the unknown.  And you might fail.  You might get hurt.  So all of a sudden, your nervous system is being activated by greater stress and greater fear.

But then something else happens.  You begin to realize that I made these positive changes.

But man, this is a slow, messy process.  I was hoping I was going to be kind of fixed within a couple months.

But six months or a year has passed, and I am still going through tons and tons of change and healing.  This is going to be a really slow process, and it is really messy.  And I do not like how slow this is.  This could take years and years, the rest of my life.  And then there's another thing you discover.  Every time I grow, it's great.

But then I learn I got a new issue.  A new level leads to a new level.  It leads to a new devil.  So you thought when you came into your recovery that your problem was addiction.  Your problem was your anger problem.  Your problem was you just did not know how to do relationships very well.  You thought there would be a couple quick little fixes and you would be all better.

But then you realize your addiction issues is because of complex trauma, is because of shame, is because of attachment issues.  Your anger issues because of shame, because of complex trauma.  Every time you grow, you become aware of a new level.  A new area that you got to work on.  So it's like, I just thought I got one area fixed and I find I got two more areas I did not even know about that now I have to fix.  Then there's another thing that happens.  As you start changing your family initially, when you were going downhill, they were trying to say you need help.  We want you to change.  Now that you are starting to change, you start to get pushback from your family.  Even persecution.  You start to get subtle pressure to go back to the way you used to be.  You might even hear, we like the way you used to be.  And so you begin to realize that the family is not as supportive as they used to be.  Your partner's not as supportive.  They are not liking these new changes.  They might even begin to falsely accuse you and say, oh, you are becoming a narcissist.  Oh, you are, you are, you are just becoming super selfish now when really for the first time in your life, you are standing up for yourself.  For the first time in your life, you are taking care of your own needs and saying, my needs matter just as much as yours.

But to them, that's you being a narcissist and you start believing that you start second guessing yourself and you go, maybe I am a narcissist.  Yes, it kind of feels like it because I am standing up for myself and you get all confused and you start second guessing yourself.  And so you hit this new level of, am I right?  Am I wrong?  Am I wrong?  Am I getting healthy?  Maybe I am what my family says I am.  And that confusion and doubt just feels terrible inside.  And so what happens for pretty well everybody in recovery is they come to this place where recovery starts to feel negative.  It starts to feel like a lot of work.  It starts to have more negative results than felt positive results.  And they begin to go.  I wonder if I made the right decision and coming into recovery.  I wonder if recovery is actually worth it.  Maybe I should go back to the way things used to be.  And they sabotage their recovery.  So growth and change creates a desire to go back to the old way.  It creates fears and stress that they were not anticipating.  And so what I want you to realize is those first three to six months of recovery.  Yes.  Start with positive.  Then they hit a real negative stretch.  Growth becomes very fragile.  It's really easy to regress to old behaviors.

But if it pushes you to realize this is temporary, this is forcing me to face fears and issues I never realized I had, it will lead to even greater growth.  So fear is such a big issue with complex trauma.  We spend a whole day thinking about it.  We spend a whole day thinking about it.  We spend a whole week in our LIFT program helping people begin working through these painful emotions and their fears.  I hope this just helps put words to some of what's been happening in your subconscious world.  I hope it helps you realize I need to get some help.  And these fears you can deal with, these fears you can get so much help with.  I hope you will do that.  I can do anything and this will help, next time so do not forget the whoever<|de|> you are with us.  May the God's grace and blessings be upon you.
