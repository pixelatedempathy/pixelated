shame.

So what we did in the very first night is understand that shame is a core belief about myself.

It's a belief about my identity.

And that belief is a negative belief that something's wrong with me.

I'm not good enough.

I don't feel lovable.

I don't feel that I have any value just for being me.

So I feel inferior, less than is my normal default setting.

And we developed what that meant, where it came from, and that for basically every person from complex trauma, they end up with shame.

Because once they are neglected or abused or abandoned or their needs aren't consistently met, they conclude it's their fault.

So I must not be good enough.

That's why I'm being neglected and abused.

There must be something wrong with me.

That's why I'm being neglected and abused.

So they develop this developing self-concept that is all negative.

What I want to do tonight is go into the next part of where does the brain then go once it's reached this conclusion that I'm not good enough.

And what I want you to understand up front is this is all happening at a subconscious level.

This isn't you sitting down consciously.

I think I'm no good.

What am I going to do about it?

This happens in the mind of a small child at a subconscious level.

So the first thing that you have to understand is the conclusion that comes is not just that I'm not good enough, but there's a second conclusion, which is if the two people that brought me into the world have concluded that I'm not good enough, therefore I can be neglected or abandoned or abused.

That means that anybody that gets to know me is going to abandon me or abuse me or neglect me.

So I can't have that happen.

And so with shame develops a fear of abandonment.

And fear becomes the main emotion that trumps everything else.

But at a subconscious level, and it's I can't stand the pain of being abandoned, but I'm afraid of being abandoned.

I'm afraid if people get to know me, they'll abandon me again.

And that scares me to death.

So what am I going to do to never be abandoned?

So that's where the brain starts to go.

So the first conclusion is I must hide who I am.

Because if they see the real me, they will abandon me.

So priority number one in my life must be to hide the real me.

But the second priority is to hide who I am.

And so I'm afraid of being abandoned.

And so I'm afraid of being abandoned.

But the third priority is I don't want to walk around feeling like I'm a nobody.

I have to somehow compensate for that feeling so that I at least feel I have some value.

And then from that comes two other priorities.

Though I feel like I'm not lovable, and though I feel I'm not valuable, I long to be loved.

And I long to be respected or to have people treat me as if I have value.

So here's what begins to happen.

I want love and respect, but I must stay hidden.

So how can I get love and respect without people getting to know the real me?

And that becomes the challenge for the brain with a person with shame.

And so what I want to do tonight is develop that for you so that you begin to see what the brain is trying to solve, what solutions it comes up with, and then I want to go to the next step.

go into some of the ramifications of the solutions the brain comes up with so the brain develops solutions that it thinks are going to fix the problem but it's limbic brain stuff it just makes things feel a little bit better but it makes things worse in the long run so here are some of the very early adaptations or solutions the brain proposes for the shame thing how to get love and respect but remain hidden so number one never be vulnerable never be authentic never let people see the parts of you that would make you weak so don't let them see you cry because then they might look down on you don't let them see you sad because then they might think less of you so now you have to hide those weak emotions not just your personality but those emotions that can creep out and then once there are people might think less of you so that's the first solution with that you then put on mass so they can't see the real me so I need to present to them something that they will like or respect I have to do an act or a role that they will say wow I like that person I want to be with her that person and so you become a mask wearer some of you relate to being a chameleon you wear a mask a different mask for each person you meet you know how to adjust your behavior to get this person to like you and how to make a different adjustment to get this person to like you you're very good at wearing masks we teach about the roles that children develop as they grow up so you talk about the hero and the jester and the invisible child and the scapegoat child i want you to think those about those roles in terms of shame because one of the purposes of those roles is not just to help the family have less pain it's to provide a solution to shame so the hero child says they can't see the real me mom and dad because they will reject me they will neglect me so i will be a hero i will be super responsible i will never cause problems i will do extra chores i will be cooperative with everything they want i will never rebel i will help out then mom and dad will love me and respect me so the child is trying to get love and respect within the family while hiding what they think are defects the second child is that invisible child that says i don't want to be a burden to mom and dad that's why they don't like me that's why they abuse me and neglect me so i will have zero needs i will never ask for anything i will never share with them my dreams or desires or wants because then i might be a burden so i have to somehow fade into the wallpaper and then i'm going to be a burden and have zero needs or desires then maybe mom and dad will say that's a good kid and they will respect me and love me so still trying to solve shame then the jester child or the comedian says i will hide behind humor people won't see the real me mom and dad will never see the sad parts of me the parts of me that are painful and might be a burden to them them laugh all the time I'll make them so they're always wanting to be with me and have me around because I just make life fun and enjoyable and everybody's happy trying to solve their shame so that is one way to look at the roles another thing that happens naturally in the brain is this if I am perfect people will love me and respect me if I please everybody people will love me and respect me so I won't let them see the real me I will just be a perfectionist or people pleaser and then I'll get the love and the respect that I long for and you see the flaw in this you get immediate love and respect but what goes on in your head you go you're being a phony if they knew the real you they would have been a fool if they knew the real you they would have been a fool and be loving you and respect you so this whole thing is getting you love and respect and it feels good but it doesn't satisfy because you know it's an act and so that becomes the problems of this another solution the brain proposes is I must lie about who I really am I must lie about things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about the things that I do that I think might get me judged I must keep secrets about struggles I have and I must keep secrets about struggles I have failures I have because I have to hide and so to hide effectively I have to become a good liar and I have to become a good secret keeper so again you can see that might work in getting people to like you and respect you but it sure isn't going to make a healthy relationship down the road if you keep lying and keeping secrets all the time it's gonna backfire sooner or later other people say I will build walls around my heart so some people isolate geographically who who wants to risk relationships with people when you got shame because you they're gonna find you out eventually so I'm not even gonna go there I'm gonna have zero relationships I'm gonna become an isolator some do that not many but some do others say I want to be with people but I'm gonna isolate by creating walls and what they do is they let you in a little bit but then you can just feel you bump into a wall and they're not gonna let you know anything further about them they're not gonna let the relationship go any deeper you can bang your head against that wall all you want but they are not going to let you in they're isolating behind walls others say my internal world is shame I'm not valuable I'm not good enough all of those things so let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and let's just make it a little bit more personal and make it better all I'm really not interested in it tough My first step is to design a just perfect here in other words all of those things let's just get going do something that you're proud of so what works is to have six Lub brains that you partner with and better you can maybe to want a Christian God wasn't gonna help you choose it either way its was it was like sevenambient human being with these set a last question and six Gods in the world is the human soul that you rely on this will never find you out is if you control everything, including controlling what people think about you.

So you have to manage the information they get about you.

So if there's something on Facebook that says something negative about you, you better go on Facebook and put pages of stuff about how wonderful you are and how about how terrible the person is that said those things about you.

You got to information manage and control everybody's thinking about you.

Some of you have tried that and it is exhausting and everybody gets kind of tired of you doing that.

The next thing that the brain comes up with is the only way people won't see my weakness is I have to be self-sufficient and never need anybody.

I got to be able to handle every problem and never need anybody.

I got to never depend on anybody else so that I'm always strong and people always see how strong I am.

They never see weakness or need.

And some of you have tried that and that seems to work for a while, but life delivers problems at times that we cannot handle alone.

So those are some of the early solutions the brain comes up with to try to handle the problem.

So the first thing that the brain comes up with is the only way people will ever be able to handle the shame issue, the fear of abandonment, trying to hide but still get love and respect.

Now I want to take that and I want to transfer that into how does that work itself out.

So I want you to think about shame and connection with people.

So one of the things that we talk about all the time is that our brain is wired with a need for connection.

So right from birth, a baby desires to connect with mom and dad.

It's built into us.

When a baby's born, we desire as parents to connect with it.

We have it driven for connection.

As we get older, we long for a partner or a deep intimate relationship where we can connect at the deepest level.

It is wired into us.

Okay, think of shame this way.

Shame is the result of not being able to connect.

So what you might think of a time when you wanted to connect to mom or dad.

Maybe you had a problem.

Maybe you were hurting.

Maybe you had a question and you went to mom and dad wanting to connect and talk about this deep issue that you were struggling with and they didn't reciprocate.

They didn't let you connect.

They didn't connect back.

They were maybe too busy, preoccupied.

They just weren't interested.

So you tried to connect but there was no connection.

What did you feel?

Must be my fault.

Maybe something's wrong with me that caused them to not want to connect with me.

So shame always results when a child is unable to connect with a significant authority figure in their life.

So what happens?

What happens from that as they grow up is they still long to connect but now they're afraid to connect.

So they long for that connection but they're afraid if they do connect somebody will find them out.

So they have conflicting desires in themselves.

A longing for connection and a fear of connection at the same time.

And so they live by this rule.

Never be authentic.

Always be phony.

Always be phony.

Because if you're authentic nobody will want to connect with you.

Your only chance of connection is if you're phony.

But you go that's not going to be real connection.

So here's what the brain does.

It says I wonder if there's a way to have fake connection.

I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without actually connecting with somebody.

I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without really connecting.

I wonder if it's possible to have the feelings of connection without relationships.

And that's where the brain goes.

And guess what?

Our culture today offers you a smorgasbord of possibilities of fake connection.

What is bar room intimacy?

Everybody hugs each other and laughs and smacks each other on the back.

And say you're great.

I just love you.

And how deep did the conversation go?

Less than one millimeter deep.

Less than one millimeter deep.

Less than one millimeter deep.

It was superficial.

There was no true intimacy.

But there were the feelings of intimacy.

And that's what fake connection is.

So on the surface to the limbic brain it seems to be satisfying.

But it doesn't really satisfy at a deep level.

It leaves you thirsty.

Do you know what the fastest growing addiction in the world is right now?

Internet.

Porn.

Why?

Fake connection.

You get the feelings of a connected relationship without a relationship.

What is the purpose for many with a one night stand?

I want the feelings of connection without the mess of a relationship.

What do many people get through sports?

It's the only time where men hug each other and smack each other on the butt.

And do all of that.

What is going on?

We're bros.

We're on the same team.

I love you buddy.

You really?

Because you have that warrior spirit.

We're on the same team fighting a battle.

And we feel close.

But it's fake closeness.

It's not real intimate connection.

So we have all kinds of things.

How about social media today?

Do you realize that most of our kids will text hundreds and hundreds of times?

And they'll be like, I'm going to text you.

I'm going to text you.

I'm going to text you.

I'm going to text you.

And they will text hundreds and hundreds of times a day or message their friends.

And they'll say we are so connected to each other.

But it is so superficial.

They haven't truly connected.

Do you know there was a study done just a couple years ago about millennial children who have all the texting social media stuff.

And what they're finding is that this generation that seems more connected than any other generation the loneliest generation to have yet existed because they don't have true connection.

So that is the reality of our culture.

We have become a culture of fake connection.

And that is a result of a shame base.

Let's see if we can get the feelings of connection without true intimacy.

Now I want to read you something that Dr.

Rachel Worsman wrote, which I think is excellent, because it's going to bring the drug picture into this whole connection thing.

So she's written an article, you can read it, called How Loneliness Fuels Opioid Addiction.

She was on TED Talks as well about this.

But here's what she says.

The human brain uses naturally occurring opioids.

So opioids, we think of morphine, oxycontin, fentanyl, heroin, those are all your opioids.

T3s have opioids.

They're painkillers, okay?

But what she says is this.

The brain uses naturally occurring opioids to maintain a balance among important brain circuits that shape social thinking and behavior.

So opioids have a bigger purpose than then deadening pain.

They're also managing other circuits in the brain.

So opioids are a part of the brain that have to do with social interaction, okay?

Making certain experiences like deep social connection feel good.

In other words, when you connect with somebody at a heart level and are able to share in an environment where you feel totally safe, totally accepted, you feel good.

Opioids are part of what makes that happen, okay?

Opioids are a part of what makes that happen, okay?

Opioids are a part of what makes that happen, okay?

Opioids are a part of what makes that happen, okay?

Opioids have a lot of different properties, and they're called endorphins.

So, what the endorphins are, is this is a powerful structure of the brain that is the most powerful and we're going to talk about it in just a moment.

The endorphins are like two compounds, the most commonly known of which are endorphins, have a similar chemical structure to morphine, heroin, and oxycontin.

A lack of strong social connection disrupts this balance amongst the brain circuits.

So you don't get social connection, all of a sudden, your brain's not getting what it was designed to get, and the opioid thing is all out of whack.

So it disrupts the balance amongst the brain circuits that use these feel-good chemicals produced by close relationships.

Now she takes that in a different direction.

When we are really hungry, we will eat anything.

Okay, we get that on a physical level.

So now what she's going to say is, similarly, loneliness creates a hunger in the brain which neurochemically hypersensitizes our reward system.

Responding to the pain of loneliness, our brain prompts us to seek rewards anywhere we can find it.

So in other words, if you don't get connection, your brain gets hungry for opioids.

That's what she's saying.

If you don't have healthy, intimate, deep connection with at least one other person, your brain is starving.

And so what she's saying is, if you don't have connection, your brain gets hungry for opioids.

And if it is starving for opioids that it can't get from relationships which it was designed to get them from, it will look for them in other places.

So guess what happens when you find opioid drugs?

It says, if we seek it with heroin or opioid painkillers, it will be like a heat seeking missile for our social reward system.

All of a sudden, our brain will say, who needs people?

I just found what I'm looking for.

I am no longer hungry.

So people are set up for opioid addictions, she is saying, because they didn't get connection in childhood.

And many of you can relate to that.

Okay, then she takes it further.

That's in part because of the striatum, which is our autopilot system.

So I talk about your default setting.

Okay, so what it is saying is if you start putting opioids from chemicals, not from social interaction into your brain, it changes your brain's default setting.

And the drug becomes the default state that keeps the pain at bay and the relief close, overriding the system that would otherwise prompt us to seek humanization.

Her gripto talk that sometimes aside from the prevarication to bringing in substances like epididymolast�� it has an alert set itself that motivates you to seek something based on your rang and down.

Okay, so if you get an adult Sergey Zahle who's going through puberty in childhood, she's going to be strengthened by the production of new medications and they're going to have a Lebanese tax incentive.

So why is it that many addicts the more they use, the more they isolate.

Because So number one, medical detox and rehab.

We're great at that.

Number two, counseling and therapy.

Both of those are thriving.

What's missing?

Number three, social connection.

That's been ignored in our recovery world.

Now she takes that even further, okay?

The striatum is what gives us the source of hope here.

So your striatum is your default setting.

So what she's now going to say is this.

Your striatum, which has been changed to now say, I don't need relationships, I just want drugs, it can be rewired.

It can be reprogrammed by starting to give it deep social connections that it longed for in the first place.

So you can retrain it so that it longs for deep social connections again.

And if we do that, we need to practice social connections, not reactive behaviors instead of compulsive behaviors.

It's not enough to just teach healthier responses to cues from our social reward system.

In other words, it's not enough just to give people tools to cope.

We have to rebuild the social reward system with reciprocal relationships to replace the drugs which relieve the craving.

Our culture and communities either create environments that are either full of things, or they're not.

They're full of things that cause addictions to thrive, or full of things that cause relationships to thrive.

I think that's powerfully, very well said.

But the problem, as I come to the end of that, is our culture today is programmed to make addictions thrive.

And we, if we are going to help people change, we have to create subcultures which are countercultures, which reintroduce social connections.

And that will reprogram the brain.

And as the brain is reprogrammed, and people are getting meaningful social connections, the desire for the opioids disappears.

And so that, I think, is very significant.

But here's the trick with shame.

Shame says, okay, I want to connect.

But as soon as you say, okay, I'm going to try and connect, fear comes up.

And it says, uh-oh, what happens if they find out I'm not perfect?

Uh-oh, what happens if they find out who I really am?

So what you're doing in recovering from shame is saying, I will risk connecting by walking through the fear of being found out.

And I will trust that if I connect with the right people, it will help me to heal.

But that is a scary step.

Okay, second thing.

How does shame affect relationships?

We just did a series on codependency, so I don't want to go into great detail.

But I want to recap for you how shame affects relationships.

So one way to understand codependency is it's two shame-based people trying to have a relationship together.

That is the best definition of codependency.

So what happens?

It's two people trying to hide who they really are.

Two people of masks and walls who are trying to get their needs met, trying to get love and respect without revealing who they truly are.

And so that's why codependency has been called the dance of two shame-based people.

Because they're dancing around, trying to get their needs met, trying to not get the other person too angry.

And that is an offense.

And that is an ongoing thing.

So what we have said is shame basically says I have no positive feelings about myself.

Because I don't believe I have value or I'm lovable.

So if I am going to have any positive feelings about myself, they must come from others.

So I must put on an act, okay?

But one of the things the brain says is if I'm in a relationship, that proves somebody likes me.

That proves that I must be lovable.

So therefore, to deal with my shame, the brain says the solution is be in a relationship all the time.

Because that will give you proof that somebody loves you, so you must be lovable.

What then is the problem if you're not in a relationship and you're alone?

Your brain goes, uh-oh, this is proof I'm not lovable.

Therefore, I've got to run into a relationship.

So the brain says, uh-oh, this is proof I'm not lovable.
