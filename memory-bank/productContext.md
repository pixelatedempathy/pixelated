# Product Context

## Problem Statement
Mental health professionals must master high-stakes scenarios (crisis intervention, trauma response, boundary-testing behavior, cultural dynamics) but cannot safely practice these skills with real vulnerable populations. Traditional training is constrained by limited exposure to rare scenarios, inconsistent feedback, and lack of scalable supervision.

## Solution
Pixelated Empathy provides a simulation environment where clinicians can practice challenging conversations with AI-simulated clients and receive feedback grounded in evidence-based practice.

## Key Value Propositions
- Psychological safety: practice without risk to real clients
- Real-time feedback: intervention suggestions, tone/approach guidance
- Bias detection: flags potential cultural/gender/racial/socioeconomic bias patterns
- Progress analytics: competency tracking over time
- Supervisor workflows: review, annotate, and guide trainees

## Target Users
- Therapist trainees and students
- Licensed therapists (continuing education and skill sharpening)
- Clinical supervisors and training program administrators

## Success Metrics
- Measurable improvements in competency and confidence over time
- High user trust (privacy, safety, and evidence-based feedback)
- Stable, performant sessions at scale
- Accessibility compliance (WCAG 2.1 AA)
