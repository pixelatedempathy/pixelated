## Phase 02 — Validation & Standardization

Summary
-------
Phase 02 ensures incoming data meets schema, content, and safety expectations and is normalized into canonical internal formats. This covers schema enforcement, sanitization, language/format standardization, and initial quality scoring.

Primary goal
- Provide a validation pipeline that rejects bad data early and normalizes accepted data for downstream stages.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Define canonical internal schema(s) and document mapping rules for each source type
- [ ] Implement schema validators and integrate with the ingestion queue
- [ ] Add sanitizers for user-controlled or free-form text (avoid XSS/HTML injection)
- [ ] Implement automated format converters (CSV/JSON/Audio → canonical conversation format)
- [ ] Build initial quality scoring component and normalize scores across sources
- [ ] Add a quarantine store for records that fail validation and an operator review workflow
- [ ] Create unit/integration tests for each validation rule and converter
- [ ] Add monitoring/alerts for validation rate and quarantine growth
- [ ] Ensure metadata and provenance tracking for each record (timestamps, source id)
- [ ] Provide tooling to reprocess quarantined records after fixes
- [ ] Update documentation and runbook for validation rules in `docs/ops/validation.md`
- [ ] Ensure any third-party parsing libraries are up-to-date and audited

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

**Canonical Schemas & Validation**
- [`metadata_schema.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/metadata_schema.py) - Unified metadata schema with comprehensive validation
- [`validation.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/validation.py) - Pydantic-based validation with sanitization
- [`dataset_validator.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/dataset_validator.py) - Dataset-level validation with quality scoring

**Format Converters**
- [`format_converter.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/format_converter.py) - Multi-format conversion (JSON, JSONL, CSV, Parquet, TSV)
- [`multi_format_converter.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/multi_format_converter.py) - Enhanced batch conversion with validation

**Sanitization & Security**
- XSS/HTML injection protection using bleach library
- Content sanitization with regex validation
- ID/speaker validation with alphanumeric constraints

**Quality Scoring**
- Initial quality scoring algorithm implemented
- Multi-dimensional scoring (completeness, coherence, relevance)
- Normalized scores across different source types

**Quarantine System**
- [`quarantine.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/quarantine.py) - MongoDB-backed quarantine store
- Operator review workflow with status management
- Reprocessing capabilities with attempt limits

**Monitoring & Alerts**
- [`monitoring.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/monitoring.py) - Real-time validation metrics
- Alert thresholds for fail rates and quarantine growth
- Integration with pipeline orchestrator

**Testing**
- Comprehensive unit tests for all validation components
- Integration tests for end-to-end validation workflows
- Test coverage for quarantine operations and reprocessing

**Documentation**
- Complete validation documentation in [`docs/ops/validation.md`](docs/ops/validation.md)
- Schema documentation and mapping rules
- Integration guidelines and troubleshooting

### ⚠️ Partially Complete
