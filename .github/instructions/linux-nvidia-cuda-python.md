# srt-model-quantizing Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

- App: srt-model-quantizing by SolidRusT Networks
- Pipeline for downloading, quantizing, and uploading models to Hugging Face-compatible repositories.
- Designed for simplicity: clone, install dependencies, and run with Python or Bash.
- Supports Nvidia CUDA and AMD ROCm GPUs (Linux servers only).

## Development Principles

- Streamline and optimize the quantization process for efficiency and reliability.
- Handle edge cases (e.g., incompatible models, quantization failures) with clear error messages and suggested
  resolutions.
- Keep all documentation (README, instructions, examples) up to date.

## AI Agent Alignment

- Prioritize simplicity and usability in all development and enhancements.
- Regularly review code quality: remove dead/duplicate code, address incomplete sections, and update documentation.
- Use a markdown file to track progress, priorities, and alignment with project goals.

## Continuous Improvement

- Actively seek and incorporate feedback on functionality and user experience.
- Suggest and document improvements that enhance efficiency or usability, while maintaining core principles.
- Clearly document all enhancements, bug fixes, and changes for transparency and maintainability.
