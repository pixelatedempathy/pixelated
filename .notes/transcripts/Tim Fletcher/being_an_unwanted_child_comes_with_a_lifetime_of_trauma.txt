One of my quests in working in the field of complex trauma is to really help people understand some of the more subtle forms of trauma. So much of the conversation around trauma gets focused on the big T trauma stuff, severe abuse, severe danger, severe accidents. And so a lot of people come along and go, I don't think I have trauma because I haven't had any of that big T trauma. But yet they've got lots of very subtle trauma. Unless they become aware of it, they're not able to really start healing and growing and working on themselves the way they could or should. And so I spend a lot of time just helping people understand some of the more subtle forms of complex trauma. So we've talked about kind of the big three, which is abuse, neglect, and abandonment. And then we've talked about betrayal trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, and abuse. And then we've talked about trauma, cultural trauma, political trauma, captivity trauma, collective trauma, generational trauma, all of those we've tried to explain and develop. What I want to do today and next time is look at some of the even more subtle forms of trauma. And you may have experienced them, you may not. I don't know that. But if you have, I think these talks could really turn some light bulbs on for you and really help you go, oh, that makes sense as to where my trauma comes from. Now, having said that, I just need to give up front kind of a trigger warning. This talk might really bring up a lot of painful stuff for some of you. It might be very overwhelming once the pieces start falling into place. And so just be aware of that. Make sure you have people you can talk to. So the very first one I want to focus on is what I call the unwanted baby. So for some of you, you definitely relate to this. So let me give you three causes of an unwanted baby. So number one, your parents might have got pregnant by accident. And when we talk about accidental pregnancies, there's really two types. So the one is a mistimed pregnancy. So they kind of want to get pregnant. Just not now. And the second is they didn't want to get pregnant at all. It was a pure accident that they're not happy about. So you can see the second one, that when the parents don't want to get pregnant. And they do. It's an accident that the child can feel very unhappy. The second one is that when the parents don't want to get pregnant. And they do. It's an accident that the child can feel very unhappy. unwanted because the parents did not want that pregnancy. The missed time pregnancy, they wanted to get pregnant just not now. You can still see how the child could pick up some unwanted stuff. But then there's a second one and that is the parents wanted a boy, not a girl. And you are a girl or the other way around. And so you just have always felt your parents wished you were a boy. You were not wanted. And then the third is if your mother died giving birth to you, all of a sudden your life cost her her life and that makes you kind of unwanted. They'd prefer to have mother over you. So those are the kind of things that can result in a child feeling unwanted. So Hungarian psychoanalyst Sandor Ferenczi says this, these are the unwelcome guests. of the family. And then goes on to say someone who is not fully invited into the world. They seem like visitors, outsiders who might leave at any minute. So that's kind of that unwanted child. Now Drexel University Women Health Blog has given some interesting information about unwanted pregnancies. And they said that about half of the pregnancies in the U.S. are unwanted, unplanned, or unintended. So again, they make the two categories of mistimed and unwanted. The risk factors for unintended pregnancies tend to be not always but tend to be people from a low social and economic status, mothers who are drug users, women who are men who are involved don't have as much education, women who are involved in the sex trade, or the type of contraceptive that was used or younger women. So those are kind of the higher risk categories. But what they're also finding, this is where I really want us to think about is that they followed what happens with the children who come out of unwanted pregnancies and they're beginning to see that there's poor maternal and child outcomes. That the children born of unwanted pregnancies are at risk of behavioral and psychological issues. In other words, somehow they get complex trauma that results then in maladaptations, behaviors in adolescents that begin to cause a lot of damage. So this whole unwanted pregnancy thing, the unwanted baby, has really led to a discussion. Can a baby in the womb, in utero, sense whether or not they're wanted? And there's a whole bunch of research that's now coming out about this that I find just fascinating. But just let me give you what has been written by several German researchers. And they said this, the fetal autonomic nervous system is negatively affected by maternal adverse emotional states. So there's now evidence that if the mom is not in a good emotional state, if she's going through a lot of negative emotions, she's going to have a lot of negative emotions. And she's going to have a lot of negative emotions. It does affect the fetus. There is currently growing evidence to suggest that increased maternal stress during pregnancy can lead to adverse effects on the physiological, metabolic, and neuronal development of the fetus during gestation with possible long-lasting effects. Generally speaking, adverse maternal emotional states such as depression, anxiety, social stress, discrimination, and general prenatal distress can lead to a lot of negative effects. Similarly, a lot of ethos and negative emotions can be associated with infertility. Maturity and mental distress can influence fetal and neonatal motor, cognitive, and social development. And I've just seen repeated research coming out that says that the fetus can be affected by the mother's emotional state. It senses it and it can activate the child's stress system, even within the womb. Emily Guarnada has said this, Babies are affected by their parents' emotional state while in the womb. but the full extent is still unknown. So we're still researching this but we're starting to see patterns and that can be both positive and negative. So on the positive for example when mothers feel joy their bodies release oxytocin also known as the bonding hormone and research from 2007 suggests that the more oxytocin that is released during the first trimester the more bonding there will be between the mother and the child after birth. So it's going to have very positive effects on the ability of the mother to bond with the child. So if the mother's wanting this child is excited about this child and oxytocin is released that's going to have a very positive effect on attachment once the child is born. But then on the negative a 2020 study noted that growing babies can be impacted by mood changes trauma and complications during pregnancy. So many factors have the potential to interrupt bonding with a child in utero including anticipatory anxiety so the mother's nervous about the baby coming or doesn't want the baby coming financial distress so just a lot of stress in the person's life the mother's stressed out that affects the child hormonal changes substance use unplanned or unwanted pregnancy and partner abandonment so divorce separation or death of a partner. All of those creates a very negative emotional world and a very negative emotional world. Stressful world for the mother which affects the baby in utero. So what are the results then beyond just in the uterus. So again the Drexel University College of Women has said here's what you can expect is going to happen to a child that was not wanted. So when they are finally born there's not going to be the attachment with the parents that would have happened if they were deeply wanted. If the parents immediately wanted to connect there's going to interrupt secure attachment then that's going to usually result in either neglect because the parents just aren't madly in love with this child so they're going to be some neglect happening or some abuse. The parents get frustrated easily with the child that the parents lash out at the child. The parents get angry a lot at the child. The parents blame the child for their problems because that child wasn't wanted. And so there's going to be neglect abuse or abuse. mild to severe that's going to start to happen the parents might meet the physical needs of the child but there's going to be a chance that the parents aren't going to fully meet the emotional needs of the child because it's almost like they got a bit of resentment against this child they didn't want this child and so the emotional needs are not going to be met usually the child that won't have parents who are going to regulate its emotions when it's upset because there's not the secure attachment there's not the meeting of emotional needs so the child is not going to develop the tools and ability to regulate their emotions properly and that's all going to result then in how it affects the development of the brain and how it affects the development of their emotions so bottom line is what you're seeing there is the unwanted child is now showing all the symptoms of their emotions and they're not going to be able to regulate their emotions and that's going to be the case for the child who is not going to have the emotional needs but the signs of complex trauma it's affecting their brain development it's affecting their emotional development and then it's affecting their ability to attach to regulate their emotions so it's having lots of negative effects physiology wise right off the bat but let's take it further to when the child gets older so what are going to be some of the long-lasting effects on this child who is unwanted and many of you know that's why we're talking about the child who is unwanted and many of you are going to be able to relate to this and this is where it's going to start to get maybe painful and overwhelming for you often children who are unwanted they may not have been told that but somehow they know what they sense it but they also may have been told it what they often find is they have an unconscious wish to die if i wasn't wanted then i really don't want to be here often they become quite pessimistic and skeptical about life life's just a negative thing for them and that's why we're talking about the child who is unwanted and many of you know that's why we're talking about the child who is unwanted and many of you know that's why we're talking about the child who is unwanted and many of you know that's why we're talking about the child who is often a mistrust of others that develops early on because if i wasn't wanted then i can't trust my parents so if i can't trust my parents who can i trust many develop suicidal fantasies if i wasn't wanted then how can i get out of here another characteristic is that they begin to have great difficulty believing their love so let's say somebody comes into their life who does fully love them but now they don't believe that person really is loving them because they've never experienced that full genuine love from their parents so they're going how can anybody truly love me so it's almost like when a person heaps love on them they can't absorb it it's like water off a duck's back they just can't believe that anybody would fully love them so what you can see here is this is producing great shame deep shame core belief that the reason i'm not wanted is must be because i'm not good enough i must not be lovable i must be a loser i must not have any value value it must somehow be my fault that i'm not loved and that deep core belief of shame is to me one of the most devastating things that comes out of a child not being wanted that leads to deep insecurities every relationship now there's lots of insecurities of what are people thinking of me do they like this about me did i do it well enough are they going to accept me or reject me constant insecurities which adds tremendous stress to their stress system but often a deep loneliness because they're not able to receive love they do not have never truly connected with anybody they just feel all alone in the world there's a haunting loneliness for them and with that they just feel they're never going to fit in anywhere they'll never belong they'll always be an outsider they'll always be kind of unwanted a black sheep and so that not fitting in belonging is also a haunting feeling that really then is a fear a fear that they will never be wanted by anybody now you can see how devastating this is how this can lead to deep depression for people but that fear of never being wanted is just a haunting fear i believe yourself not to know it is also the fear of not being wanted by them it's That fear is soました there is so much fear that does not shook or stay the spirit i'm a radical in anυou what do you experience of your!!! not being loved or sacred orandelorized for anyone rough however impeding beyond your definition and hope women stuff for them and loving them not because they want to because they're obligated to because they have to but they don't enjoy it they don't really want to do it they long to connect with people to finally have somebody that wants them who wants to connect with them but they have a deep fear of connecting because if I connect to people they'll get to know me and if they get to know me then they're not going to want me because nobody else has and so I want intimacy but I'm afraid of intimacy so that begins to affect every relationship but beyond relationships they move off into adult life and they get a job but now they have this irrational fear that the boss is going to want to fire them or they get into a relationship and they have an irrational fear that the partner even though things are going well wonderful the partner is getting ready to dump them because deep down they feel they're unwanted so no boss would really want them no boss would really want them no partner would really want them everybody's planning to get rid of them and so they have this fear that any success any good stuff happening to them isn't going to last something bad is going to happen the other shoe is going to drop anything that good is happening is just too good to be true so don't get your hopes up that life could be fulfilling and wonderful and that results in many people who are unwanted babies sabotaging every good thing in their life I'm unwanted and so I'm going to get dumped eventually so let's just get it over with I will mess it up now I will get other people to dump me or if they're in a relationship I'll abandon you before you abandon me I am going to get out of this relationship because I'm pretty sure you're eventually going to end it so I'll get out and it will hurt less if I do the abandoning than if you abandon me then in another direction because I'm pretty sure you're ultimately going to get out and it will hurt less if I do the abandoning that's definitely going to happen in a way that's한데as Court сч Lords who here say true because they think it's their fault that they're they were unwanted they're angry at the world because they think it's their fault that they're they were unwanted they're angry at the world and then for some they just develop an anger at God why would you have me born And that can lead for many people to a deep self-pity. They just develop this victim mentality. Poor me, my life sucks, everything's against me. And they just kind of wallow in this self-pity all the time, feeling sorry for themselves. And it's kind of their way of validating their own pain, but it just feeds off itself. Then in another direction, many people who are unwanted as a child, when they get into adult lives, they are drawn to people who are going to not want them. They are drawn to people who are going to fulfill their self-fulfilling prophecy that nobody will ever want me. So they're, without realizing how, subconsciously drawn to people who will reject them, who will not want them. And so they repeat the same message and reinforce it over and over again. Some, they go to... I need to get people to want me. So they don't naturally want me, but could I do something that will get them to want me? So some become people pleasers. If I just do whatever you want, will you then want me? So that can come out of not being wanted. Others go, if I do everything perfectly, so I'm a perfectionist, then will you want me? So that's their brain's solution to not being wanted. Even if they get in a relationship. And the person seems to want them, they just aren't able to receive love into their soul. So if you were an unwanted child, I hope this just helps make sense out of some of your life. But I also want you to realize that you can heal from this. This is complex trauma. And part of what we do all the time is really help people begin to get to that core shame. And the beliefs that came out of not being wanted. And begin to heal that and change that. And develop a connection with yourself and with safe people. It's a long journey, but it is a possible journey.
