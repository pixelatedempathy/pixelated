- Fallback polling works when WebSocket connections fail

### 7. Error Handling & Retry Mechanisms
**Priority: Must-Have**
- Comprehensive error handling with user-friendly messages

- Graceful degradation for service failures
- Error reporting and monitoring integration
- Client-side validation with immediate feedback

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Users receive clear error messages for all failure scenarios
- Automatic retries attempt recovery up to 3 times
- System remains functional when individual services fail
- Errors are logged and reported to monitoring systems
