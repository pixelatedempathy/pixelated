      - **C. DialogueRNN:**
        - **Strengths:** Uses GRUs to model individual party states and overall emotional context, capturing sequential dependencies.
        - **Suitability Assessment:** Robustness to varying conversation lengths? Effectiveness in capturing subtle emotional cues compared to attention-based models? Performance on our specific dialogue styles.
      - **D. Bidirectional Contextual LSTM (bc-LSTM):**
        - **Strengths:** A foundational LSTM-based approach that captures past and future context for emotion classification in utterances.
        - **Suitability Assessment:** While potentially simpler, does it offer competitive performance against newer architectures on our data? Can it be easily extended for multimodal inputs?
    - **II. Multimodal Capability Assessment:**
      - **Objective:** Determine the extent to which these architectures (or their published variants) can leverage multimodal inputs (text, audio, visual cues) and how this aligns with our platform's potential future capabilities (e.g., voice input, video therapy sessions).
      - **A. Text Input:**
        - All models handle text. Evaluate preferred text encoders (e.g., GloVe, BERT, RoBERTa) and their impact on performance and computational load.
      - **B. Audio Input (Speech Emotion Recognition - SER):**
        - **Existing Support:** Check `conv-emotion` implementations or related papers for audio feature integration (e.g., MFCCs, eGeMAPS, wav2vec 2.0 features).
        - **Fusion Techniques:** How are audio features fused with text features (early, late, hybrid fusion)? Effectiveness of these techniques.
        - **Our Use Case:** Primarily for analyzing user speech if voice input is enabled. Less critical for AI responses unless TTS characteristics are part of the model.
      - **C. Visual Input (Facial Emotion Recognition - FER):**
        - **Existing Support:** Check for integration of visual features (e.g., facial action units (AUs), facial landmarks, embeddings from pre-trained FER models like ResNet-FER).
        - **Fusion Techniques:** How are visual features combined with text/audio?
        - **Our Use Case:** Relevant if video therapy or avatar-based interactions with facial expressions are considered. Requires careful ethical and privacy consideration.
    - **III. Evaluation Criteria & Metrics (for each model/variant):**
      - **A. Performance on Standard Benchmarks:** Report F1-scores, accuracy, recall on datasets like IEMOCAP, MELD, EmoryNLP, DailyDialog (as per `conv-emotion` original evaluations).
      - **B. Performance on Our Datasets (Planned for Prototyping Stage):** Anticipate performance on `EmpatheticDialogues`, `ClimbMix`, or other internal datasets reflecting our specific therapeutic style.
      - **C. Context Handling:** Ability to accurately classify emotions that depend heavily on prior turns or overall conversational flow.
      - **D. Computational Resources:** Training time, inference latency, memory footprint. Feasibility for real-time or near real-time application.
      - **E. Robustness & Generalization:** Performance on noisy data, unseen speakers, different dialogue styles.
      - **F. Interpretability:** Ease of understanding model predictions or identifying influential features (if possible).
      - **G. Ease of Integration:** Complexity of adapting the model to our existing AI pipeline (`PythonBridge`, `EmotionDetectionService`). Compatibility of dependencies.
      - **H. Extensibility:** Can the model be easily fine-tuned or adapted for specific therapeutic contexts or user populations?
    - **IV. Suitability for Our Use Cases:**
      - **Real-time Emotion Feedback:** Which models offer the best latency/accuracy trade-off for providing in-session emotional insights?
      - **Post-session Analytics:** Which models provide the most nuanced and accurate emotional arc for therapeutic pattern recognition?
      - **Multimodal Potential:** Which architectures are best suited for future integration of voice/video analytics, considering both technical feasibility and potential user benefit?
