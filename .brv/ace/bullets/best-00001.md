Phase 8 Error Handling: Created comprehensive error handling system with ErrorBoundary, error utilities (normalizeError, formatErrorForUser), error logging service with monitoring integration, and enhanced form validation with inline feedback. Forms use Zod validation with real-time error display via ErrorMessage and FieldError components. API client uses validateApiResponse for response validation. Note: React Hook Form integration utilities created but package not yet installed - forms currently use enhanced Zod validation with inline feedback.
