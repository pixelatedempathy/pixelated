 Well welcome to another Friday night. We're taking a deeper look at the 60  characteristics of complex trauma, spending one night on each one and I'm  hoping that again it's helping you understand yourself better and healthy  tools for changing and getting healthier, more healthier self. Today I want to  look at one authority issues and I want to come at it from the perspective of the  behavior disorder, the diagnosis of ODD or oppositional defiance disorder and  then conduct disorder and this has become a diagnosis that is becoming more  common with children and teenagers. So I want to look at that. So let me begin  with a definition. So ODD or oppositional defiance disorder is a disruptive  behavior disorder in children and teenagers characterized by patterns of  unruly and argumentative behavior and hostile attitudes towards authority  figures. So it can present to people watching that this is a very stubborn  child but ODD is authority issues and it goes much deeper than just  stubbornness and that's what I want to explore. I want to look at what causes a  person to have authority issues. Where does this defiance come from? And I think  the main reason is complex trauma. I think those with ODD and conduct disorder  usually have a complex trauma piece that until it's understood you're not  really going to understand why they do what they do because on one level ODD  doesn't make sense. Why would a person do that but on the level of the person  doing it it makes total sense and it's not just one aspect of having complex  trauma that can lead to oppositional defiance or authority issues. Let me  give you a list of things that take place in complex trauma that can  result in a child rebelling becoming defiant. So the first is parents that are  over-controlling and so the child is resisting the over-controlling. So I've  drawn a line on the left is the parent's control on the right is the child's  control. The bottom is the child as an infant and at the top is a child entering  adulthood. So when a child as an infant the parent has total control because the  child can't do anything for themselves so they totally trust the parent to feed  them protect them to meet their needs but as the child gets older the parent  gives up control and lets the child take more and more control of their  decisions so that by the time the child reaches adulthood it's flipped. The  parent now has no control over the child and the child now is total control in  their life. So what you see then is parenting is a process of going from  total control to giving up all control. But what happens in a family where the  child is get or the parents are afraid the child's gonna make the same mistakes  that they did and end up in addiction end up on the street whatever. They might  be tempted to maintain control for longer than they should or what happens in a  family where the parents are all about looking good image so they want to  control the child more because the child is a reflection of them or what happens  if a child grows up in a family where parents are perfectionists and they want  the child to do everything perfectly no messy rooms ever. They will clamp down on  control longer than they should and so what happens in the child is actually a  good thing. They push back, they resist, they defy trying to create some space  to develop into a person of autonomy, a person who is able to make  decisions for their own life. So they're trying to create a little bit of space  from them and dad so that they can grow up. But what then often happens with  parents is they're afraid that the child is rebelling so they try to clamp down  even more and the child pushes back harder and the parents try to clamp down  even more and the child pushes back harder and it gets to the point where whatever  the parents tell them to do, they'll do the opposite. They develop an attitude  towards their controlling parents that says try to control me, I defy you. But what  can then happen as they go into adult life is when somebody tells them what to  do or gives them advice, they don't stop and consider is this wise advice or  not, they immediately go to somebody's trying to tell me what to do, I'll do the  opposite. They defy advice not based on its wisdom but based on the fact that  somebody else is telling them to do it. And if it happens to be mum or dad, they  will defy even more. And so oppositional defiance order disorder becomes this  blind defiance to all input from the outside from any authority not based on  is it wise advice or not but based on the fact that it's an authority. And that  you can see could be come a really big problem and we'll get into that in a  bit. The second thing is in a complex trauma family there's often a double  standard. So dad can kind of live by one set of rules and get away with a  whole bunch of stuff but the kids have a different set of rules. So dad can get  angry but they can't. And so what they begin to realize is I don't like this  authority person because they're using their authority to get what they want.  And they're imposing stricter rules on us. And so now they're rebelling  against the hypocrisy of that authority figure saying it's right over here for  you guys to do this rule but I don't have to follow it. And the hypocrite. And so  the person who uses their power their position of authority to be selfish. And so  it's actually a good rebellion in the child to say I don't want any part of  that. I rebel against that hypocrisy. And then many children in complex  trauma begin to realize that the rules that are being created for them aren't  what's best for them. It's not about that. It's about what makes life easier for  the authority figure. And so now rules are not seen as loving guidelines to  keep me safe and healthy. Rules are seen as something that restricts fun, that  restricts development. Rules are seen as bad. And in their mind fun is  had by breaking the rules. Fun is had by going outside of the rules. And so they  rebel against boundaries that aren't healthy. And again there's a lot of good  stuff in that kind of rebellion in the child. And then in a complex trauma  family for many children they don't respect their parents because they're  abusive and neglectful double standard all of those things. And now these  people that they don't respect at all are throwing all these rules on them. And  there's something in us that if I don't respect you I don't respect the rules  you're setting and I want to rebel against it. And that's what the child would do.  Or in a complex trauma family often the rules are enforced inconsistently.  Some days the rules apply some days they don't. And so what I hope you're  seeing is whenever there's poor boundaries within a home children will  rebel against that somewhat. Then another thing that happens in complex trauma  is there's no connection. So the child is supposedly in this family but they  don't feel part of it. They don't belong. And so now why should I follow the  rules of this family that doesn't even want to connect with me? And they  rebel against that. And then sadly in many complex trauma families if a rule is  broken there's a harsh punishment. Now I need to explain the difference  between punishment and discipline. Discipline I'm going to use as a good  thing. Punishment is a bad thing. So discipline is a child steps out of a healthy  boundary so they tell a lie. Or they keep teasing or picking on their brother  sister. So the parent wants to give a consequence that's painful enough not  just as an end in itself to say I want to hurt you because you're hurting  somebody else. But to provide motivation to the child to go I don't want to stay  doing this behavior because it's painful. I want to go back to being unhealthy.  So discipline is given from a loving place. It's appropriate consequence with  the desire to bring a child back to healthier living. Punishment is you make me  mad because you broke my rule. Now I want to hurt you. Now I just want to make  you pay as an end in itself. The motivation is not to see them change their  behavior. The motivation is to hurt them. And so if a child is getting that kind of  response when they break the rules punishment instead of loving discipline they  will start to rebel against that. And then in many complex trauma homes there's  lots of fighting conflict tension. And a child begins to go this is a sick  family. I don't want to be part of this. And they rebel against that. Or they're in  a family where every time they ask for something there's told no. And so they  begin to go nobody cares about me. I can never get what I want even when it's  legitimate. And they develop a rebellious attitude. And then the final one in  many complex trauma families. The child is hurt in many different ways. All the  that violate love their abuse they're neglected their disrespected life is  unfair for in the family. They're abandoned. All of those things hurt deeply. And  what happens naturally in a healthy way is an anger that says I want to change  this. But in complex trauma that can't be resolved. They can get as angry as  they want. But it's still going to be unfair. It's still going to be disrespectful.  They're still going to be neglected. And so what can happen to a child is the  anger turns to a bitterness, a resentment, a hatred against the parents, the  authorities that run this family. And they become defiant. Let me just make  this note. In many complex trauma families this child becomes known as the  problem child. And they're used as a skateboard goat to say the reason we're  having problems in our family is not because of the parents it's because this  child is so rebellious. And all of the blame for all the family's problems gets  put on them. But in reality, this child I hope you can see is actually  identifying and being honest about all the unhealthy things in the family that  nobody's resolving. Nobody's improving. And so they're getting to a point where  they're just rebelling against it all but then are being branded as the  problem. But they're the only honest person who's in the family who's not  living in denial of what's going on. So that takes me now to oppositional  defiance disorder. So kind of the extreme end of the spectrum of authority  issues. So it has three main characteristics which then have kind of  subcharacteristics. So the first is a person is diagnosed with ODD if they  are a child or teenager who's very angry and irritable all the time. And they  lose their temper a lot. And they have temper tantrums. They throw things. They  stomp. They slam doors. They're a person that's very easily annoyed. You just  smile at them the wrong way and they get mad at you. You ask them a simple  question and they get mad at you. Almost everything you do is responded to by  them with anger. And it seems that no matter how hard you try to please them,  they can't be pleased. And so what you find then is this angry child who's  very discontent. They're just never satisfied with anything. So they hang on  to their anger for protection, but they're not willing to give it up. And so  they become angry. Their main emotion is anger. Then the second characteristic is  that they're very argumentative and defiant. So if they're out with mum or dad  and mum says, look at the sky. Look how blue it is today. The child says the  sky is not blue, it's green. It doesn't matter what the evidence is. They don't  care about that. They are just not going to agree with mum. And that is that  defiance argumentative thing. So what's going on here is that they don't want  anybody else to control them. And that's what's come out of the authority  abuse is now I can't have anybody if control me at all. So if anybody makes a  comment to me, if I agree with it, I might be letting them influence me and  control me. If I take advice, I might be letting somebody control me. And so  they argue everything. Every opinion they disagree with or argue against. And  often it's with authorities. They just do not want to have anybody control  them so they must argue everything. And that includes they will now question  every rule and go, this is a dumb rule. Why is this here? And then they will  refuse to comply with some rules even though they might be good rules. Just  because they don't want an authority controlling them and telling them what to  do. So you can see there's a real fear of being controlled by another  abuse of authority. And instead of thinking there might be some good  authorities, they now put every authority in the bad category and they must  resist all rules by authorities. You can try to work with them and get them  to negotiate and to make a compromise. And you can be willing to make  compromises with them, but they're not willing to negotiate. They're going to do  the exact opposite they're going to rebel. And then you find in an organization  they become very critical of the authorities. They're always looking for  flaws in the authorities. They take things that happen and twist it to make the  authorities bad people. That's how deep this goes. And so they become a person  who then just wants to be on in odds with everybody. Not just with authority.  It begins to spread. Now they purposely do things to annoy other people to get  out of the people to not like them. They have this need now to maintain their  identity of being the problem, of being angry, of standing up for themselves. They  might say, so they are blame or trying to trigger other people. They're trying to  pick fights all the time. So they then go to blaming everybody else for their  problems. They're not willing to look at their roots stuff because the fear is  so great. And I will add the shame is so great that they must blame everybody  else. And there's a self-righteousness that begins to happen in them that I'm  not afraid to stand up for myself and do what I think needs to be done. And so  that kind of attitude deepens. So you can see how it's spreading. First is with  authorities. Now it's starting to spread into all relationships. But there's  something else that I hope you are seeing is happening inside of this person.  As they've been through that stuff in their complex trauma family, not only  have they rebelled outwardly, they've started to harden their heart and their  conscience. There's been no way to resolve the problems in their family. And so  instead of getting hurt repeatedly, they harden themselves. And so a person with  oppositional defiance has a hardened or is in the process of hardening their  conscience and their heart closing it to people. The third characteristic of  oppositional defiance is vindictiveness. And what we mean by that is they just  want to pay people back. They want to hurt people. So if they're upset with  somebody, they will begin looking for ways to hurt that person back. And they  might do it very sneaky in a very covert way, very passive-aggressive, or they  might do it in a very overt way. In your face, I want everybody to know that I am  hurting you. And then they'll say a lot of things behind people's back. But when  they're upset and you're in a conflict with them, some of the stuff that comes  out of their mouth is extremely hurtful. Because that's their priority is  hurting others. And then it turns into this deep resentment where they refuse to  let go of wrongs. You can apologize. You can try to, you can try to make it  right, but they want to hang on to the hurt and never let it go so they don't  forgive. And then if they're in a relationship with somebody that's been a  really good friend, and that friend hurts them instead of wanting to work it  out, they will destroy what has been a good friendship just to hurt the  other person back. So this vindictiveness becomes a big part of who they are. So  that's oppositional defiance. So I suspect that as I've been going through that,  you're thinking of yourself, your partner, but also your kids. And maybe you're  seeing some of your authority issues and your ODD just a little bit more clearly.  Now I want to add, there's what is also called conduct disorder. So conduct disorder  is a group of behavior, behavioral, and emotional problems where children  display aggressive, destructive, and deceitful behavior. So let me explain that. So  it's a child who displays very aggressive conduct. So it's a child at school  that's the bully. He's always wanting to pick on somebody, or be this very  intimidating kid that's scaring other kids, or it's a child that gets a certain  pleasure out of hurting other people or animals. This is a person that can  then want to use a weapon. And then later in life, they can get into raping  people. This is part of that kind of ODD going into this, what they call  conduct disorder. And then there's the deceitful part. And so they are liars. They  break and enter. They start entering into the world of crime, stealing, forgery,  fraud. They're sneaky. And then destructive behavior, arson destruction of  property. So what you see is a child who's been beat down, controlled. Now there's  this anger, which results in I refuse to be controlled by anybody. I will rebel,  but now I need to hurt other people. And I need to do stuff to vent my anger.  And I will then get a high out of being destructive, deceitful, hurtful,  being the bad guy. So what they find is that for boys, they're more likely to  display aggressive and destructive behavior. And girls are more likely to  display deceitful behavior, but it doesn't have to be that kind of strict  separation. It can cross over. So you go, okay, I see this in children, but I  think maybe I see some of it still in myself. And that's where I want you to  think about authority issues, long term results. If I don't start looking at  this honestly and dealing with it, I might be diagnosed with ODD as a child  and teenager, but it's still going to have negative stuff in my adult life. So  here's some of the negative results in adult life. You can't trust anybody in  authority that they have your best in mind. Therefore, you have difficulty in  work settings because you don't take orders well. You have difficulty in  relationships, intimate relationships because you don't like input, you don't  like suggestions. You don't like working out problems. You just want your way.  And that creates a lot of problems. And so a lot of people with ODD, when they  get into adult life, they're destroying relationships, jobs, and then they  begin to go into kind of more social isolation, where they don't want friends.  They don't think they need friends and they become this very lonely person who's  angry at the world, who blames everybody else. But then for some, they have gained  their image, their identity, their validation from being a rebel. So they were  looked up to in their teen years by dressing a certain way, acting a certain way  because they were a bad boy. And now they have this thing that they still have  to do that in order to still get respect and validation. And so for some, they  want to take that rebellion further, they keep pushing the envelope more and  more, and they go into darker places sexually, legally, religious breaking of  rules, just because they have to keep living out this identity. And that can  put them in a very dangerous place. For some, they just forever refuse to take  any input into their life. They only want to figure it out for  themselves because they think they're smarter than everybody. And so they stop  growing. And then because of all of that, they don't feel understood. And sadly,  what begins to happen is they then need to control others. So if they do get  into a relationship, into a family, they're not willing to compromise, they're  not willing to take input. It's got to be done their way. And guess what? They  are now doing the very things they hated that their parents did to them. They  are becoming what their parents were to them. And so it passes to the next  generation. And they repeat the controlling behavior with their children. All of  that means that this person often will be doing stuff that they really don't  want to do. But they feel they have to do just to rebel against what the other  person wants them to do. And so they'll start making bad decisions, which will  have bad consequences. And they know what academically that this is really dumb,  but they can't stop themselves from rebelling. And then they can't let go of  grudges and forgive even if a person is sorry and wants to work on the  relationship. And so they begin to have fewer and fewer friends. And so what you  begin to realize is that they're slowly self-destructing. They're destroying  everything good in their life just so that they never let others control  them. So somebody who said that ODD conduct disorder is an exhausting disorder  that affects the entire family when a child with a disorder behaves in a manner  resembling the terrible twos magnified by 50. And when you see a 30-year-old  a 40-year-old still acting like a two-year-old having a temper tantrum  magnified by 50, it's a very sad thing to behold. So let me go to healthy. And I  think the place that we need to begin is, is there such a thing as healthy  authority? Because what comes out of complex trauma and ODD is a belief that  all authorities abuse their power and there's no healthy authority. So let me  begin with what is the purpose of authority and just think with me about  authority? So healthy authority is realizing that my children live out of their  limbic brain that says I just want to feel good. I want to eat chocolate. I want  to be lazy. I want to get angry and hurt somebody. And so they thinking out of  their emotion center and doing what feels what they feel like they need a wise  person to set boundaries for them, boundaries that define loving behavior. So  that the child will stay in those boundaries until they get old enough and  wise enough to see the wisdom of living within those boundaries. If the child  steps out of the boundaries, then a healthy authority says I don't want to let  them stay where they're lying and stealing and cheating. So I will use discipline  not punishment, discipline, an appropriate negative consequence that hopefully  will motivate them back inside the boundaries. But more than that, a healthy  authority says I will actually live these boundaries out in my life. I will be a  role model. I'm not just going to tell them what to do and then do something  different myself. And then as a healthy authority, I will take care of those  under my authority. I will meet their needs. I will keep them safe. I will be  there to support them. I will connect with them. I will love them unconditionally.  That's the purpose of a healthy authority. And so I hope you see that children  need that. They need a healthy parent to guide them in the development of life  which is also the development of their brain and their cortex so that it  becomes wise so that they become a healthy person. It is so important. But go  beyond just the family. If we had a culture where there were no authorities and  everybody could just do what they wanted, it would be a culture that would  quickly descend into everybody living out of their limbic brain. And that means  that I will take the law into my own hands. I will execute justice the way I want  to. I don't care about others. I only care about myself. And it will become a  culture that gradually becomes more narcissistic and it would descend into  total chaos. And so within culture we need authorities. Healthy authorities is  the ideal who will keep culture living within the boundaries of what defines  love. Now I want you to go further in your thinking. Bob Dylan had a song that  says you got to serve somebody. And I think he was recognizing an important  truth. We all will serve an authority. We can rebel against all external  authorities and just live with the authority of ourselves. Do you realize that  that can be one of the worst authorities? My own distorted thinking and  brain, if I'm unhealthy, but we will surrender to our brain. But we live in a  society that is under, it means we have to live under authority. So let me just  explain that to you. We live in a society where there's government, where  there's police, where we have a boss at work, where we have parents within a  family, four separate authorities that are just part of a society. Sadly, not  all of those authorities are healthy. And so one of the challenges in getting  healthy ourselves is when do I submit to an authority that's not healthy? And when  do I draw a line in the sand and take a stand and stand up and refuse to  submit to that authority? And that is a very important skill to develop to know  how to do that well. But let me go back to this, we choose authorities as well. So  some authorities are giving us within society, but we can also choose other  authorities. We can choose ourselves. We can choose to let friends influence us,  giving them power to influence us. That's giving them authority in our lives. We  can choose a higher power that we're going to let influence us with morals and  beliefs and values. All of that we can do. But what I want you to understand is if  we choose an unhealthy authority, we give power to somebody who's not healthy to  influence us, it will result in pain. Unhealthy authority equals pain. And we  get to choose a lot of that stuff. And so the reality is we live in a world where  we have authority and we need healthy authority. And we need to figure out how to  live in that world. So let me give you some practical things. When you receive  instructions or advice from someone or an authority tells you to do something, pause  before you react because it will probably trigger you. So resist the urge to  immediately defy. Focus on weighing out what was said versus who said it. So stop  focusing on an authority told me to do this. I got a rebel and switch to okay an  authority said this, but is it wise or not? Let me look at what they said and make  that my focus and determine whether I should follow it based on whether it's wise  or not based on who said it. Shift internally to begin doing that. Now let me say this.  If you got major authority issues, you're going to get triggered and probably for many  years. What I want people to understand is don't beat yourself up just because you're  triggered and don't beat yourself up just because maybe initially you begin to go  defiant, keep learning from each experience so that you are growing from each  experience and dealing with some of this deep, deep authority stuff. So then another  way to look at all of this, if an authority gives you instructions and you're triggered,  you go into your limbic brain. It's your limbic brain that gets fired up. So you need to  get out of your limbic brain and back into your cortex before you respond because if you  stay in your limbic brain, then you're going to go back into defiance and make decisions  that will probably have negative consequences. Now let me just flip this and get you to  think about it this way. If you have oppositional defiance disorder, you are now wanting to  get healthy. And so one of the things you realize is I need to set some boundaries with  people. I do need to say no. When some people ask me for certain things, when you set a  boundary, part of you is going to feel like, oh, I slip back into being defiant. And so  part of your journey is going to be to figure out, am I in saying no being defiant or setting  a healthy boundary? Very important to begin to make that distinction as you grow in healing from  this authority issue stuff. The last thing I want to say is, what do you do if you're a parent  and you see ODD in your children? Well, first of all, understand that it's there for a reason.  They weren't doing it just to be difficult. They were doing it to survive in circumstances  that they couldn't resolve in a healthy way. So you have to be patient in getting them to a  point where they trust your authority as being good. Okay. Then when you ask them to do something,  don't just say do this. Explain why you want them to do it. Help them understand your reasoning.  And then realize that it's not just about you giving them instructions, it's about them  gradually being able to trust you again as a healthy authority. So you work on yourself.  You keep growing yourself. That's what your ODD child needs is for their parents to grow.  And then the final thing that you do with a child is remember the line of responsibility for  parents and children going from 100% parents to zero. Start giving them a bit of freedom to make  some decisions. Now you start with decisions that aren't going to be disastrous decisions that  they can do kind of have freedom to choose what clothes they might wear today or what they  want to do on Saturday or what they would like to have for supper tonight and just begin to give  them some freedom to exercise the ability to make decisions. And then you give them more power as  they show some wisdom as they show some maturity beginning to happen. I've talked to many people  with authority issues who are now adults and they at times hate themselves because when they get  rebellious they hate the decisions they make in that rebellious state and they want to change what  they realize this is very hard to change. This is deep rooted stuff. And so I hope that what I've  shared has helped you understand it, helped you not to be so hard on yourself or your kids  to try and change it but to begin to have some healthy tools for doing that.  Okay that's the end of part one. We're going to take a short break and then I'll come back and do  a short piece of Christian part. If you're not interested in that no problem. Thanks for being  here for the first part. We'll see you next week for everybody else. I'll be back in a minute.  Well welcome back. We have been going through the life of Peter, one of Jesus 12 disciples, a man who  became a leader in the movement started by Jesus. And I hope you've been finding his life to be  helpful. The lessons that he had to learn that Jesus taught him are so vital, so applicable to  people from complex trauma. And so we've been going through the various vignettes that are given  in the Bible about Peter and today we come to Matthew 18 and it says Peter came to Jesus and  asked, Lord how often should I forgive someone who sins against me? Now you need to understand that  that was a common debate topic in that religious culture. And so Peter says seven times.  Now what you need to understand with that is that that was considered extremely magnanimous  to forgive somebody seven times made you a saint. And so Peter is kind of looking for a pat on  the back by saying, look at me Jesus if somebody is sins against me. I'm at a point where I could  forgive them seven times and he expects Jesus to say, wow I'm impressed. But Jesus says no not  seven times but seventy times seven. Now that was an idiom in that culture, a figure of speech  for saying unlimited. There's no end to how often you should do it. And then Jesus tells a story  says, therefore the kingdom of heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts  up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him. In the process one of his debtors was  brought in who owed him millions of dollars. He couldn't pay. So as master ordered that he be sold  along with his wife, his children and everything he owned to pay the debt.  But the man fell down before his master and begged him, please be patient with me. I will pay it  all. Then his master was filled with pity for him and released him and forgave his debt of millions  of dollars. But when the man left the king he went to a fellow servant who owed him just a few  thousand dollars. So similar circumstance, but a smaller amount. He grabbed him by the throat  and demanded instant payment. And the fellow servant fell down and begged him for a little more time.  Be patient and I will pay it. He pleaded. But his credit curve wouldn't wait. He had the man  arrested put in prison until the debt could be paid in full. When some of the other servants saw  this they were very upset and they went to the king and they told him everything that had happened.  And the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, you evil servant. I forgive you that  tremendous debt of millions of dollars because you pleaded with me. Shouldn't you have a mercy on  your fellow servant just as I had on you. Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured  until he paid his entire debt. And then Jesus says, that's what my Heavenly Father will do to you  if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters from your heart. Now let me just  say a couple of things about forgiveness because this passage is often used I think maybe misused  to say you should just let somebody hurt you and hurt you and hurt you and you you should just  take it and keep forgiving them and keep forgiving them. You need to understand that this passage  is in a context and what comes before this passage is Jesus giving teaching about what you do when  somebody hurts you. And so he says you go to them privately and confront them and try to work it out  if they refuse to change well you go to part B and you take somebody with you  and you try to work with the person if they refuse still to change you take others with them  and Jesus' point is you're looking to see if this person's heart and their heart  so that they're unwilling to change no matter what anybody says or does. And then he says if you  find out that they are hard in their hearts and they're not willing to truly change then you  set a boundary with them. You put them out of your life so they can't keep hurting you.  So the context is how to respond when people hurt you. And so he says in many cases you will go  through a series to check if they're willing to change or not and if they're not willing to change  you set a boundary so they can't keep hurting you. Okay now we come to this passage  and part of what is happening here is I think it's about people in our lives  that can keep hurting us and we can't set a boundary with them. So let me give you three these three  examples. So number one in every close relationship we will hurt each other. Hopefully not intentionally  but unintentionally we will hurt each other but if we're both wanting to grow we'll apologize,  we'll change, we'll make it right but we still hurt the person but because we want to change we  forgive each other and we are growing together but we still will keep on hurting each other.  So we keep forgiving because the person is continually growing and changing and owning it. So that's  number one. Number two we live with these authorities in our culture. We will have governments and  bosses and pleas that will do things that do hurt us and we can't do anything about it all the time  and so that's another situation where we're treated unfairly and we don't have a recourse  and then the third is family. So even though we can set boundaries with  parents with maybe our children who are now acting out in adult life they still seem to find ways to  hurt us and so what do we do in those situations where we still are getting hurt but we can't set a  boundary? Okay so let me back up and have you look at all of this from another angle. What happens  when we're hurt? It kicks off our justice meter and now we go this is not right, justice needs to be  done. So they hurt us, they need to have a consequence for doing that. That's justice so we  have three options. Number one we can go to the legal system, we can report the crime, we can  press charges and let the legal system handle it or we can take justice into our own hands and say  I'm going to execute my brand of justice and I'm going to hurt them back or the third option  we can release them by forgiving. We can relinquish our desire to take revenge. So those are basically  the three options in the situations where we're hurt by others. So let me go from another angle.  Think about this hurt stuff. So I've already said in any relationship we work to not hurt each  other but we can't totally avoid hurt. That's part of intimate relationships and so if you are  growing you accept that because if you're in a relationship where both of you are growing and  working on yourself you will resolve the hurts, you will work through them and grow from them.  So if somebody hurts you we can like I say confront them, we can go legal on them, push her justice  or set boundaries, okay? If they are truly sorry then there's the option of restoring the  relationship. So a hurt comes between people in a relationship. An apology and a change by the  person and growth means the relationship can be restored that the thing that came between us is  removed. Now there's one other piece. Another person could own that they hurt you, they could change  now it's up to your internal world because what happens when I'm hurt is I want to close my heart  so I don't get hurt worse. That's a self-protection thing. If they apologize I'm still hurt  if they change while you still hurt me so forgiveness is I see evidence of change of truly being sorry  okay now I must choose to open my heart again to them  and that is forgiveness and that is what is so difficult to do  and I think that's what Jesus is getting at so we go to why and that's the purpose of this story.  Why should I forgive somebody who's hurt me? So Jesus does this contrast story and the picture is  this king and his subjects is really God and us and if you look at our relationship with God we've hurt  God millions of times we've broken his laws we've done done things outside of love  we've abused the gifts that he has given us we've rebelled against him we've closed our heart  to him at times all of those things we've accumulated all kinds of crimes and hurts against God  but what happens when we get to a point where we say I'm so sorry God forgive me and we surrender  to God again and we begin to change God amazingly forgives us for the millions of crimes that we've  done against him that should overwhelm us with gratitude but the problem that Jesus is getting at  is then what some of us do is when somebody hurts us we go I want to get even I want them to pay  for what they've done and they might be truly sorry and they might apologize and change but we won't  open our heart to them again we're going to hurt them and Jesus saying after what how much God  forgave you you can't forgive somebody else a little wee bit that says that your heart has not  truly changed and been affected by God's great forgiveness of you so you haven't really changed  yourself like you said you were going to so the evidence of truly changing is I open my heart  again to my God surrendering to him I work at changing and that means loving and forgiving  others when they hurt me and they apologize and they want to change and so what is Jesus saying to  Peter Peter you're getting the right idea that forgiveness is important but I want you to understand  a bigger picture about forgiveness and why it is so important and I hope that Peter as you go out  and represent me you know that you're going to get hurt over and over again you're going to be  treated unfairly and there's going to be the temptation to become bitter and angry and hateful  and despiteful and defiant against the authorities against people that hurt you but Peter keep  your heart open keep your heart soft keep forgiving let's pray Father I just thank you for  again the life of Peter and the lessons that we learned and Lord our heart is such a key piece  and we close it so easily to protect ourselves and I pray that you would just help each one of us  to see any resentments that have caused us to keep our heart closed and be willing to forgive  and to grow in this very important area amen well that's the end of another Friday thank you again  for being here for this little bit of sharing together and I look forward to seeing you again  next week have a great weekend
