How can somebody escape the victim mindset?  Well, so if I was talking to a person like that, I would say, first of all, I get it because I have been to that place myself.  I mean, I have had moments when I did not think life was worth living and I imagined my own suicide.  Never that I planned it or I was going to do it, but I kind of fantasized it, you know?  I have been to those places, so I get it.  Secondly, I would say, I feel that the world's against me.  That's not a feeling.  It's a belief, okay?  If you have that belief, it's because at some point you had that experience.

But you are not having that experience right now.  That experience was that of a child who was helpless and alone.  So what's showing up in your belief system is not your present situation, but your childhood emotional experience.  And like I said before, in the present, we can heal.  No matter what happened then, we can heal in the present.  So the first thing I would ask a person like that is, are you willing to consider that healing is possible for you?  Or have you totally given up?  By the way, a person who's totally given up would not be telling you this.  Because when people talk this way, whether they know it or not, they are asking for help.  If they were not asking for help, they would not say anything.  They would just slink off on their own and isolate themselves.  And some people do.  So anybody who speaks the way that you just cited is already, whether they know it or not, they are looking for help.  And if that's the case, then they can be helped.  And so that's the second point is, do not try and solve this on your own.  We are human beings.  We are creatures that evolved in connection and community.  You are not alone with this.  It may feel like you are alone.  And you certainly might feel lonely.

But you are not, in fact, alone.  Millions feel exactly the same way.  And they are not crazy.  And you are not crazy.  Those beliefs and feelings are normal responses to abnormal circumstances.  So that's how I begin working with the people, with the person, with that mindset.  And I guess to take this one step further, I have heard you talk about that one of the main problems with society today is that a lot of people who have mental health struggles and they are struggling with situations like this where they feel stuck and they cannot get out of their own way at times.  They feel like people are against them.  They are dealing with trauma.  And then they might go see somebody who's not trained in trauma.  They do not have the experience.  How can somebody begin to take that path and make sure that they are finding somebody that is trained in that and then also that they are able to self-regulate themselves?  When needed?  Well, that's a huge question because unfortunately, look, I have been through medical training.  I am a physician.  And the average physician never hears any of the stuff I just talked about.  The average psychiatrist does not get any training in trauma.  Not in.  They learn something about PTSD, which is a specific form of trauma.

But they do not learn about the traumatic basis of depression and anxiety and ADHD.  And they learn nothing about it.  So it's very difficult to find good help within the medical system.

Now, many therapists also do not get any such training.  There's a lot of therapists that are designed only to change your beliefs and your behaviors, but not to address the fundamental reasons for those behaviors.  So a lot of psychologists trained in CBT, cognitive behavioral therapy, or dialectical behavioral therapy.  A lot of them are not really.  And I know this.  Believe me, I know this.  They just do not know much about or anything about trauma.  Then they cannot help you with the fundamental wound that you are carrying.  They can help you with the manifestations.  And that's not useless.

But they cannot help you heal at your core.  So then there are therapies that are deeper than that.  There is body-based therapies such as somatic experiencing developed by my friend and teacher, Dr.  Peter Levine.  There's sensory motor psychotherapy developed by Pact Ogden.  There's EMDR that works for some people.  There's internal family systems.  There's a lot of different therapies that are developed by my friend and colleague, Dr.  Richard Schwartz.  There's compassionate inquiry, which is based on my work.  And I train therapists in that method.  There are others, other names I could mention.  There's Larry Heller, Lawrence Heller, and his work and his students.  So what you have to look for is somebody who's trauma-informed and is willing to work with you, not just on your behaviors, but on your core wounds of which the behaviors are symptoms.  Yes, thanks for bringing that up.  Because in my own experience, I mean, I have struggled off and on with my mental health over the years.  I mean, I told you a bit about my story in our last conversation.  And when I would go, there was not a lot of talk about my childhood.  It was just like, all right, you are having some anxiety.  Cool, here's a pill.  And then I would just take it.  And I would just think, OK, this is going to cure my anxiety.  And then I would realize it's not really.  I am still getting anxiety.  I am still struggling.  What's going on with this?  And it was not until I understood my past and my trauma and how that was all related to what I was experiencing in the present that things were able to change.  And so let's just say that somebody has now, they found somebody they are comfortable with that's helping them heal their trauma and change their present and their current behaviors and patterns and that sort of thing.  And then they go down weeks down the road, months down the road, and they are on the up and up, but get triggered.  Or they experience a situation where they are like, oh my gosh, I thought I was getting better.  Why is this coming up?  What's your advice to people who are dealing with triggers when they are on the road to recovery from trauma?  Well, there's two ways to ask that question that you just raised.  Why is this coming up?  Is that a question?  What is it actually?  What is this teaching me?  No.  When you say, why is this coming up like that?  That's not a question.  It's a statement.  It's a statement that says, this should not be happening to me.  Okay?  Now you ai not going to learn anything that way.

But if you actually ask it, , I wonder why this is coming up.  Now you can learn something.  If I came to you and said, well, you are doing this.  How would that feel to you?  I would probably get defensive and I would just feel like a little ashamed.  Exactly.

But what if I said, , I wonder why you are doing this?  It would force me to think a little bit and practice the pause and say, well, I do not know if it would force you, but at least they would invite you.  Right?  Right, right, right.

Now, so that's the first point is how should we ask this question?  It's a good question, but we have to ask it as a question, not as a statement or resentment or resistance.  That's the first point.  The second point is use the word trigger.  Really great word.

Now, if I showed you a rifle with a trigger, how big a part of the rifle is the trigger?  It's very small.  Very small.  For that trigger to set off anything, what there has to be, there has to be a mechanism to deliver ammunition.  There has to be ammunition.  There has to be an explosive charge.  When I get triggered, let's say you say something to me and I get triggered, what you said was a very small little thing.  I am the one who's got the explosive charge.  And the ammunition, you did not cause me to do that.  If I did not have that ammunition explosive charge, you could say whatever you want.  And I just sit here saying, , I wonder why he's saying that.  You know?  So triggering is a great opportunity to learn.  When you get triggered, you could either focus on, resent and resist the trigger, or you could say, huh, what was I still carrying inside that I have not looked at yet, that I have not resolved yet?  So if, you know, I used to tell the story, you know, I have been married 53 years now, my wife and I.  So let's say 20 years ago, I might ask to sleep with her and she would say no, you know, which is, nobody can ever believe that that ever happened, but it did used to happen, you know?  And how would I respond?  I would respond by going to a rage and curling into a fetal position and not even wanting to live.  Okay?

Now, the trigger is the no that she said.  The explosive is my belief that I am being rejected.  And abandoned and not wanted.  And that I am an infant and helpless.  Which is what happened to me.  Otherwise, if she says no, oh, I can get curious.  Are you tired?  Or have I done something to turn you off?  Or is there something wrong we can talk about?  Or I can just be disappointed and let go of it and say, okay, well, thanks.  You know, there will be another day.  So how I respond is not dependent on the external event.  It's dependent on what charge I am carrying.  So triggers are wonderful times to learn about yourself.  So if you ask the question, well, why did I react that way?

But, huh, I wonder why I reacted that way.

Now, there's a whole lot of learning to be done.  So that's what I will call compassionate curiosity, where we are actually curious about ourselves, but not in a self-judgmental way, but in a compassionate way.  Oh, this brought up the pain of rejection.  Obviously, I am still carrying that wound.  Well, let's look at that because it's not happening in the present.  I am glad you brought that up in that we have to change the language and how we talk to ourselves during those moments because for me personally, I am extremely hard on myself.  So that like voice that you were saying, like, you know, like, why is this happening or why is it doing this to me?  Like, that's something that I have said in my life very, very frequently because of the fact that I am really hard on myself.  I sometimes, when something does not go my way or when I get triggered or bothered by something, even though I have done it, I have done a lot of work on myself.  I am so hard on myself because I am like, gosh, like I am better than this.  I know I should be doing better than this.  So that was really eye-opening for me.  So thanks for sharing that.  Well, and you know, that voice in your head that tells you all that stuff.  In this book, I actually talk about getting into a relationship with that voice because this is what I call a stupid friend, you know, because at some point that voice came along when you were quite small.  See, if you were suffering as a kid or things were not going well, there's two assumptions the child could make unconsciously.  One is, the world is dangerous.  My parents do not know how to love me, value me.  I cannot trust anybody.  I am all alone.  I am going to suffer in this world.  The other belief unconsciously is, there's something wrong with me and maybe if I work hard enough, I can fix it.

Now, which belief is more protective for the child, do you think?  The second one is more protective.  Exactly.  So it came along as kind of a friend to keep you going.  It's a friend.  I say it's a stupid friend.  The reason, I am joking when I call it stupid, but the stupidity comes in because it does not learn that you are no longer that child.  It keeps giving you the same message.  So my suggestion, Doug, is next time you hear that voice, say hello to it and say, thank you.  You know what?  Because ask yourself, how old is that voice?  I mean, how old were you when it first came along?  I mean, I was young because I remember there was this idea that I developed about myself from when I was a child that I was not good enough because I was not picked for sports teams.  I got yelled at a lot.  So give me an age.  Five, six, seven?  Yes.  I mean, I would say I was in elementary school, I think.  Well, let's call him a seven-year-old.  This voice is a seven-year-old kid telling you a story.  So say hi to it.  Hello.  I got it.  You are still working to make me better in this world, but you know what?  Relax, kid.  I can take care of it now.  You know?  It's just a little immature little friend.  That's all it is.  It did not come along to torment you.  It came along to actually protect you.  Right.  And I think you are right.  It's so important to have a conversation with that voice and then also change the conversation with that.  And then along the lines of like, you know, childhood, one of the things that my audience wanted me to talk to you about more in depth is like parenting and that parents are having a hard time right now, I think, with their kids growing up in this world that is hard.  You are easily distracted.  You are easily addictive.  You are easily on your screen all the time.  Like, what advice do you have for parents who are raising kids in this world today so that they can, you know, raise them to the best of their ability?  It's very difficult to raise kids these days because we are not living in the way that human beings evolved.  Like, every animal evolves in a certain environment and context and is suited to that environment and context.  If you want to understand elephants, do not study them in a zoo.  Study them out in the forest or where they live, you know?  And human beings, we no longer live in the environments even close to it in which we evolved.  Out there in nature, in small groups connected to each other.  Parenting kids was what used to be a group activity.  It happened in the tribe, in the clan.  Parents had lots of support.  Kids spent their whole day around their parents.  It was not goodbye in the morning, hello in the evening.  And most of our time is spent away from each other.  That never used to be the case.  Not throughout millions of years and hundreds of thousands of years.

Now, we cannot go back to that life, you know?  Nor would anybody want to necessarily, but we have to understand what we have lost.  So first of all, you have to understand a few things.  Understand a few things.  The great Buddhist teacher, Thich Nhat Hanh, who died about a year ago, he said that the greatest gift a parent can give to their child is his or her own happiness.  So take care of your emotional states because your kid is sensitive enough to be downloading your emotional states and making them their own.  So if you are stressed, unhappy, depressed, anxious, addicted, believe me, your kid is going to absorb all that and make it about themselves that there's something wrong with them.  So take care of yourself.  Live a life that you can live with.  And if you get the first three years right, by the way, you got it made.  So when your kids are really small, consciously make the first three years as stress-free and as clear of psychological dysfunction as possible.  That means work on your traumas.  Work on your relationship with your partner or your spouse.  That's the first thing.  Beginning with pregnancy, by the way, number one.  Number two, understand what the needs of children are.  Needs of children are for unconditional loving, acceptance in the context of a secular relationship where the child does not have to work to make their relationship work.  The acceptance and the regard should be unconditional.  Allow the child to have all their emotions.  Whatever the emotions are, let the child have them.  Understand them.  Do not force them to suppress their emotions.  I am not saying be permissive with behaviors.  I am saying do not force the child to suppress their emotions.  Do not tell them not to be angry.  Do not tell them to cheer up when they are sad.  Validate the anger.  Validate the sadness.  These are essential brain circuits for such feelings.  Nature gave them those for a reason.  Allow the child to experience them.  That way they can stay connected to themselves.  Thirdly, there's a need for spontaneous free play out in nature.  Get the hell away from these devices.  Do not give a one-year-old an iPad or a cell phone.  Get rid of the screens in your house when your kids are small.  Have a screen in a locked room for yourself if you need one.

But do not be phoning and texting and emailing around your kid.  Because the message they get is the device is more important than they are.  Do not go for a walk with them and texting and looking at your cell at the same time.  Do not give the kids these devices.  They have been documentably shown to interfere with the healthy development of brain circuits.  This has been shown on brain scans.  So if I was raising kids today, I would not let them near a screen for years.

On the other hand, I would encourage them to be outdoors, be with them, play in nature, spontaneous creative play.

So, these are the essential needs of children.  I talk about them in this book.  They are difficult to provide in this culture.  Because if you do any of this stuff, you will be an outlier.  Because all your friends and all your kids' friends' parents will be on their cell phones all the time.  So you have to make a decision not to buy into the false values of this, what I call this toxic culture.  So that's some basic advice, you know, easily said, hard to achieve, but at least these are the goals that we need to be striving for.  I wish I had known this stuff when my kids were small.  That's it.
