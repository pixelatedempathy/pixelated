# Quick Method Selector - One-Page Decision Guide

**Purpose**: Select the right thinking method in under 60 seconds

**When to use this**: You have a problem and need to quickly identify which method(s) to apply without reading all documentation.

## 🎯 3-Step Selection Process

### STEP 1: Define Your Problem First ⚠️ MANDATORY

**Before selecting any method**, spend 30-60 minutes clarifying the true problem:

→ **[Problem Definition](problem-definition.md)** ← START HERE

**Quick check**: Can you answer these?
- [ ] Is this the real problem or just a symptom?
- [ ] What evidence supports this is the actual problem?
- [ ] How will you measure if it's solved?
- [ ] What are your hidden assumptions?

❌ **Skip this → Risk solving the wrong problem efficiently**

### STEP 2: What Outcome Do You Need?

Choose the category that best matches your goal:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ YOUR GOAL                          │ CATEGORY           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Find WHY something happened        │ → ROOT CAUSE       │
│ Create something new/different     │ → INNOVATION       │
│ Plan strategy or make big decision │ → STRATEGY         │
│ Improve existing process/workflow  │ → PROCESS          │
│ Make fast decision under pressure  │ → DECISION         │
│ Resolve conflicting viewpoints     │ → SYNTHESIS        │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### STEP 3: Assess Complexity

**Simple** (< 30 min):
- Single cause or clear chain
- 1-2 steps to solution
- Obvious solution path

**Medium** (30-45 min):
- Multiple factors (3-5)
- Some ambiguity
- Requires analysis

**Complex** (45-60 min):
- Systemic (5+ factors)
- High interdependencies
- Requires decomposition

## 📋 Quick Selection Matrix

### 🔍 ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS

**"Why did this happen?"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Simple** | [5 Why](5-why.md) | Single causal chain | 15 min | 100% |
| **Medium** | [Fishbone](fishbone.md) | Multiple factors (People/Process/Tech/Env) | 30 min | 100% |
| **Complex** | [5 Why](5-why.md) + [First Principles](first-principles.md) | Need fundamental restructuring | 60 min | 100% |

**Quick decision**: One cause? → 5 Why. Many factors? → Fishbone.

**Examples**:
- "API is slow" → 5 Why
- "Customer churn increasing" → Fishbone
- "System failures recurring" → 5 Why + First Principles

---

### 💡 INNOVATION & BREAKTHROUGH

**"How can I create something new?"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Simple** | [SCAMPER](scamper.md) | Modify existing idea | 15-30 min | 100% |
| **Medium** | [TRIZ](triz.md) | Technical contradiction | 30-60 min | 100% |
| **Complex** | [Design Thinking](design-thinking.md) | User-centric innovation | Days-Weeks | 100% |
| **Complex** | [First Principles](first-principles.md) | Challenge assumptions | 1-2 hrs | 100% |

**Quick decision tree**:
```
Improving existing? → SCAMPER
Engineering trade-off? → TRIZ
Creating for users? → Design Thinking
Challenging fundamentals? → First Principles
```

⚠️ **AVOID**: DMAIC, Kepner-Tregoe (0% success for innovation)

**Examples**:
- "Improve onboarding flow" → SCAMPER
- "Need speed but can't sacrifice reliability" → TRIZ
- "Build new product" → Design Thinking
- "Rethink entire business model" → First Principles

---

### 🎯 STRATEGY & PLANNING

**"What should I do strategically?"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Simple** | [GAP Analysis](gap-analysis.md) | Clear current → target | 20 min | 100% |
| **Medium** | [SWOT](swot.md) + 2x2 Matrix | Strategic assessment | 30-45 min | 75% → 100%* |
| **Complex** | [SWOT](swot.md) + [GAP](gap-analysis.md) | Full strategic plan | 45-60 min | 90% |

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: When using SWOT for decisions, you **MUST** add 2x2 Priority Matrix
- Without matrix: 33% failure rate
- With matrix: 100% success rate

**Quick workflow**:
```
1. SWOT → Assess situation
2. 2x2 Matrix → Prioritize (Maximize Strengths vs Address Weaknesses)
3. GAP Analysis → Execution plan (Current → Target → Actions)
```

**Examples**:
- "How to grow from 10 → 100 customers?" → GAP Analysis
- "Limited resources, what to focus on?" → SWOT + 2x2
- "Market entry strategy?" → SWOT + GAP

### ⚙️ PROCESS IMPROVEMENT

**"How can I make this better/faster/cheaper?"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Simple** | [Pareto](pareto.md) | Have data, need prioritization | 15 min | 100% |
| **Medium** | [PDCA](pdca.md) | Iterative improvement | Cycles | 100% |
| **Medium** | [GAP Analysis](gap-analysis.md) | Goal-oriented improvement | 30 min | 100% |
| **Complex** | [DMAIC](dmaic.md) | Six Sigma quality | Weeks | N/A* |

**Quick decision**:
```
Have quantitative data? → Pareto (find vital 20%)
Need continuous iteration? → PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Act)
Know target state? → GAP Analysis (bridge plan)
```

⚠️ **AVOID**: DMAIC for creative problems (use only for quality/process)

**Examples**:
- "Too many customer complaints" → Pareto (find top 20% issues)
- "Want to improve team velocity" → PDCA (iterative sprints)
- "Need to reduce costs by 30%" → GAP Analysis (current → target)

---

### ⚡ DECISION MAKING

**"I need to decide quickly/systematically"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Simple** | [OODA Loop](ooda-loop.md) | Fast, dynamic decisions | Minutes | 100% |
| **Medium** | [Kepner-Tregoe](kepner-tregoe.md) | Systematic analysis | 1-2 hrs | 100%* |

**Quick decision**:
```
Time-sensitive + changing situation? → OODA Loop (Observe-Orient-Decide-Act)
High-stakes + need thorough analysis? → Kepner-Tregoe
```

⚠️ **AVOID**: Kepner-Tregoe for creative innovation (use only for decisions)

**Examples**:
- "Market shifting, need to respond now" → OODA Loop
- "Choose between 3 architecture options" → Kepner-Tregoe
- "Emergency production issue" → OODA Loop (act fast, iterate)

---

### 🤝 SYNTHESIS & INTEGRATION

**"How do I resolve conflicting perspectives?"**

| Complexity | Method | When | Time | Success Rate |
|------------|--------|------|------|--------------|
| **Medium-Complex** | [Dialectic](dialectic.md) | Both sides have merit | 45-60 min | High* |

**When to use**:
- Two legitimate but opposing viewpoints
- Need integration, not just choosing one side
- Example: "Team A wants speed, Team B wants quality"

⚠️ **AVOID**: Using for simple problems (over-engineering)

**Examples**:
- "Speed vs Quality trade-off" → Dialectic (find synthesis)
- "Centralized vs Decentralized architecture" → Dialectic
- "Build vs Buy decision" → Use Kepner-Tregoe instead (not opposing views)

## 🔗 Common Method Combinations

For complex problems, combine methods in sequence:

**Pattern 1: Root Cause → Solution → Validation**
```
5 Why → First Principles → PDCA
Example: Technical debt requires breakthrough thinking
```

**Pattern 2: Strategic Planning Full Stack**
```
Problem Definition → SWOT → 2x2 Matrix → GAP Analysis → OODA Loop
Example: Business strategy formulation and execution
```

**Pattern 3: Innovation Pipeline**
```
Design Thinking → SCAMPER → TRIZ → Pareto
Example: Product development and prioritization
```

**Pattern 4: Complex System Debugging**
```
Fishbone → Pareto → 5 Why → First Principles
Example: Multi-factor systemic issues
```

## ⚠️ Common Selection Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Skipping Problem Definition
**Symptom**: Perfectly solving the wrong problem
**Fix**: ALWAYS start with [Problem Definition](problem-definition.md)

### ❌ Mistake 2: Over-Engineering Simple Problems
**Symptom**: 60 minutes on a 5-minute problem
**Fix**: Assess complexity first (use Simple methods for simple problems)

### ❌ Mistake 3: SWOT Without Prioritization
**Symptom**: Long list, no action plan (33% failure rate)
**Fix**: ALWAYS add 2x2 Priority Matrix to SWOT

### ❌ Mistake 4: Wrong Method-Problem Match
**Examples**:
- DMAIC for innovation (0% success) → Use SCAMPER/TRIZ
- Dialectic for simple problem → Use 5 Why
- Kepner-Tregoe for creative problem → Use Design Thinking

### ❌ Mistake 5: Stopping at Surface Solutions
**Symptom**: Problem keeps recurring
**Fix**: Use 5 Why or Fishbone to find root cause
