# Framework 4: Navarro (Non-Verbal Behavior Analysis)

## Comfort vs Discomfort Signals

**Comfort Indicators**:
- Leaning forward, open posture
- Genuine smiles (crow's feet)
- Ventral fronting (chest/belly exposed)
- Relaxed hands

**Discomfort/Stress Indicators**:
- Touching face/neck (self-soothing)
- Closed posture, crossed arms
- Foot pointing away (desire to leave)
- Pacifying behaviors (rubbing, fidgeting)

## Analyzing Written/Verbal Behavior

When persona is based on research (not direct observation):
- Hesitation words: "maybe", "I think", "possibly"
- Absolute language: "never", "always" → hidden fear
- Deflection: Changing subject or going abstract
- Over-justification: Providing excessive reasons

## Output Template

```yaml
Predicted Stress Triggers:
  - Direct challenge to expertise → defensive
  - Questions about past failures → withdrawal
  - Rushed timelines → anxiety

Comfort Zones:
  - Discussing established processes → confidence
  - Peer validation mentioned → relaxation
  - Authority figures invoked → relief

Verbal Patterns (from research):
  - Absolute language: "Cloud is never secure" → deep fear
  - Deflection: "Let me check with my team" → avoidance
  - Over-justification: Long explanations → uncertainty
```
