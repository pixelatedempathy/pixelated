Statistical Test: Paired t-test
Significance Level: α = 0.05 (two-tailed)
Power: 80% minimum
Effect Size: Cohen's d ≥ 1.0 (large effect)

Sample Size Calculation:
- Expected improvement: 75%
- Standard deviation: 20%
- Minimum detectable difference: 15%
- Required sample size: n = 34 (accounting for 15% attrition)
```
