# Phase 02 Improvements

## 1. Define canonical internal schema(s) and document mapping rules for each source type

## 2. Implement schema validators and integrate with the ingestion queue
- Add custom Pydantic validators for semantic validation using NLP libraries like spaCy for content analysis.
- Support schema versioning to handle evolution without breaking existing data flows.
- Integrate schema validation into CI/CD pipelines for automated drift detection and testing.
- Allow dynamic schema updates via config files for flexible source handling.
- Add schema documentation generation tools for better maintainability.

## 3. Add sanitizers for user-controlled or free-form text (avoid XSS/HTML injection)

## 4. Implement automated format converters (CSV/JSON/Audio â†’ canonical conversation format)

## 5. Build initial quality scoring component and normalize scores across sources

## 6. Add a quarantine store for records that fail validation and an operator review workflow

## 7. Create unit/integration tests for each validation rule and converter

## 8. Add monitoring/alerts for validation rate and quarantine growth

## 9. Ensure metadata and provenance tracking for each record (timestamps, source id)

## 10. Provide tooling to reprocess quarantined records after fixes
