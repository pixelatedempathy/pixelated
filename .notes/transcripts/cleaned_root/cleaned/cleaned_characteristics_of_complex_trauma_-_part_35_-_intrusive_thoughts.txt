I thought this Friday I would look at one of the characteristics of complex trauma that does not get talked about a lot, but I think it's important to look at.  And that is the whole topic of intrusive thoughts.  And these are kind of dark thoughts that just pop into your head, uninvited, unwelcome, and they are very different from your normal, typical thought flow throughout a day.  I think it's important to say up front that they have done a number of studies on how frequently these happen, how many people have this.  And one global study says that 93% of participants reported having at least one intrusive thought every three months.  And that held true for people who did not have a diagnosed mental health problems.  And so it's a very common thing to get an intrusive thought is the point.  Everybody has it.  The only problem is that for some people, it interrupts their life and creates a lot of anxiety.  And so what we begin to realize is there's kind of two categories of people when it comes to intrusive thoughts.  So the first category is the thought pops into the person's head and they just kind of ignore it.  And move on with their day.  Do not give it any weight, and it's not a big issue.  The second category is people who have difficulty ignoring it.  They begin to obsess about it.  It creates a lot of anxiety.  It creates distress.  It creates shame.  And so in these cases, it's often classified as a type of OCD.  What I want to look at today is just maybe it's more a complex trauma issue for those people that they just need to understand the complex trauma part and where it comes from.  What I think is just so sad for those that once they get it, they obsess on it.  It creates a lot of shame is that for them, it just is debilitating.  They think it makes them a terrible person.  They are afraid to talk about it to others for fear that they are going to be judged or ostracized.  So they just try to manage it on their own, which they are not doing successfully.  And it just compounds in a greater and greater difficulty in their life.  So I really want to just dig into this.  If you struggle with this area, hopefully you will find it to be very helpful.  So let's begin with some definitions, and I am just going to give you different kind of definitions you can find on the internet that just begin to form an understanding of what exactly we are talking about here.  So very basic definition, an unwanted thought, image, or impulse.  Spontaneous and nature often resisted involuntary unwelcomed.  Intrusive thoughts seem to come out of nowhere.  These thoughts and images are unwanted and often unpleasant.  The content can sometimes be aggressive or sexual or you could suddenly think about a mistake or a worry.  An intrusive thought is an unwelcome involuntary thought, image, or unpleasant idea that may become an obsession.  Is upsetting or distressing and can feel difficult to manage or eliminate.  The thoughts may become paralyzing, anxiety, provoking, or persistent.  Intrusive thoughts may also be associated with episodic memory, unwanted worries.  Intrusive thoughts, urges, and images are of inappropriate things at inappropriate times and generally have aggressive, sexual, or blasphemous themes.  So someone said if a thought is bothersome, disturbing, and it's something you want to push out of your mind, it might be an intrusive thought.

But the thought feels hard to control.  I think it's important to say right up front is while intrusive thoughts may be disturbing, they are not harmful, they are just thoughts.  And they do not mean that you have a secret desire to do the things that pop into your mind.  And I am going to explore that a bit more later, but I just want to emphasize that up front.  So some of the types of intrusive thoughts that people get.  So some get them around germs and infections or other kinds of contamination.  So once they get that thought, they just cannot shake it and then it creates tons of anxiety.  Others fear that you or your loved ones will get sick, hurt, or die.  Again, you can see once you get that thought, tremendous anxiety, but others get these thoughts that create an impulse or just this thought of doing violent acts, acts of aggression, hurting other people, stabbing people, murdering people, running them over with your car.  All of those kind of intrusive thoughts that just happen or thoughts of harming yourself or thoughts of suicide that just pop into your head.  Then some get doubts about doing a task wrong or leaving a task unfinished.  And just that begins to paralyze them.  Others around religious scruples so that they might do something wrong that will displease God, that will cause them to go to hell, that will make them an immoral person.  Others acting or doing or saying the wrong thing in public and just the anxiety that that causes.  Or others of memories of something you really want to forget.  Memories of something that's way in the past, but it just keeps coming into your mind and haunting you.  Others unwanted sexual thoughts, including thoughts of being sexually assaulted or of sexually assaulting somebody else.  Or that gets turned into thoughts about sexually abusing a child.  And those can be just very shame creating intrusive thoughts.  Or fear that you are going to do something dangerous or illegal and get yourself into trouble.  Or worry that you forgot something important, like turning the oven off or turning the fireplace off and that there could be something disastrous happen.  So those are the categories of the types of thoughts that people get.  What I want you to understand is that there's been many myths that have developed about intrusive thoughts.  And one of the most distressing is that these thoughts mean that you subconsciously want to do them.  So if the thought comes into your mind, it must mean you want to do it.  And I want to say upfront that that is simply not true.  In fact, the opposite is true.  The reason this causes so much distress for people is because they do not want to do it.  They are fighting that because it's unacceptable that it's at odds with who you are.  So understand right upfront that just because you get this thought does not mean that that's who you are does not mean that something in you wants to do it, rather the opposite is true.  You are so upset because that's not who you are and you do not want to do it.  So somebody said this and I think it's important to think about.  The problem for people who have these thoughts is that unwanted intrusive thoughts feel so threatening.  That is because anxious thinking takes over.  So what you are he's pointing out is the issue now is not the thought it's the anxiety piece around it.  And the thought as an abhorrent as it might be seems to take on a power of its own, a power it does not really have.  People tend to try desperately and urgently to get rid of these thoughts which paradoxically fuels their intensity.  So by focusing on them, by struggling with them, you are actually making them stronger.  The harder they try to suppress or distract or substitute thoughts, the stickier the thought becomes.  So it's like anxiety fuels this whole process.  So what causes these thoughts?  That's really the question.  Now if you were to look just on the surface very generally, the answers and they are all good answers, but the surface issues going on is number one stress.  So what they have found that any life stressor, if it gets big enough, it can increase your risk of intrusive thoughts because your brain is trying to solve a stressful situation.  And so different thoughts are going to pop into your head as possible solutions.

Second, depression.  So a person stuck in a deep depression is going to get intrusive thoughts because the brain is exploring possible solutions to why I am feeling so crappy.  And it's going to come up with some bizarre solutions that are just going to pop into your mind.  The same is true with anxiety and the same is true with mental health disorders.  So you look at stress, depression, anxiety, mental health disorders, the very obvious explanations for intrusive thoughts.

But I want to take it deeper.  What we are finding is people with complex trauma.  People who have lived for a stage in their life with profound fear, profound loneliness, deep unresolved emotional pain and a sense of helplessness and hopelessness, they will develop intrusive thoughts.  So it's a person who has grown up in a situation where they were gaslit, mocked, ridiculed, bullied.  Lots of religious groupels and fear of going to hell are going to end up with intrusive thoughts.  So this trauma piece is what I want to really dig into to find out what's going on and it's really understanding how the subconscious mind works.  So I have talked about this a bit in the past but just to summarize in the 1990s, the test was done to explore and really begin to understand the power of the subconscious mind, how big the subconscious mind is compared to our conscious mind.  And what they did was they exposed people to words that related, let's say to elderly people.  And all of a sudden what they found is people walked more slowly.  Not consciously, just subconsciously, they just started walking slowly.  Then they exposed people to words that related to professors.  And all of a sudden people seemed to do better at the game of trivial pursuit.  It was something sharpened in their mind when they were exposed to the word professors.  And then they exposed people to the word hawk soccer hooligans and all of a sudden people were acting dumber and crazier.  And so they began to realize it's just a single word and people did not have to hear it consciously.  They could hear it subliminally and it changed their behavior.  And they realize there's a part of our mind that has tremendous power.  And once it gets an idea there, it operates independently of our conscious mind and it can cause us to do stuff that we are not even aware of.  It's operating in a subconscious place and doing all kinds of things that are affecting us.  So John Barg who's been a pioneer in this research.  So these experiments really what he saw show that mental processes happen automatically or subconsciously.  So they do not need conscious control.  And most of these processes were not even aware of but they just have whisp of stuff that comes to our conscious mind.  And we are aware of these whisp but we are not sure kind of what they are about or how they are connected to everything.  They just kind of flow on through.  So you can think of just even dreaming where you wake up in the morning and you go, well, my dream was bizarre.  It was about this, this, this, this.  And when you think about it from your conscious mind, you go, that does not even make sense.  That's impossible to happen.

But in your dream, it was very real because your subconscious mind was just processing a whole bunch of different things.  And somehow it was all fitting together in a way that seemed to be powerful in your dream.  So the subconscious mind is doing stuff and releasing little bits and pieces to our conscious mind.

But then he began to kind of be able to explain the differences between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind.  And the key one was this, your conscious mind is very limited.  It can only think about one thing at a time.  Whereas your subconscious mind, it can think in parallel.  It can think about hundreds of things at a time.  And so that then led us, them to understand is that your conscious mind, when it can only think about one thing at a time, your subconscious mind is still processing all the other things that your conscious mind does not have the bandwidth to think about, it's the subconscious mind is taking care of it.  So your subconscious mind is actually processing 95 to 99% of what is going on, whereas your conscious mind is only processing a couple percent of what is actually happening in your life.

But your subconscious mind is processing not just one thing, but multiple things in parallel at the same time.  So another way to say all this is this, your brain is not a cohesive unit that just thinks about one thing.  Your brain is made up of many, many parts.  Each part is functioning on its own.  Each part is processing, thinking about stuff, processing memories, coming up with solutions, ideas, emotions.  And sometimes those different parts are thinking about two different things that are opposing each other that are conflicting with each other, that are coming up with conflicting emotions.  So her brain can be in conflict.  Our brain is just doing its job, all the different parts.  It's an extremely sophisticated machine.  So because of complex trauma, some of those parts may have been trained incorrectly.  They may now be processing according to bad programming, according to lies, according to deep wounds that have never been resolved.  And they are still trying to resolve it.  Those are just still doing their job.

But once in a while, they come up with a thought and it pops into our conscious mind as an intrusive thought.

But it's just doing its job.  So the subconscious mind is so important to understand if we are going to understand intrusive thoughts.  And it's to realize that this multifaceted brain with many parts is often in conflict because of unresolved trauma from the past.  There's a second piece to this that is so important to understand.  And it's to really appreciate that our brain processes from the bottom up.  So when our five senses pick up information from our environment, from people places, things, events, all of it goes first to our brainstem.  And our brainstem compares it to past memories to see if there's any correlation, if it's safe.  If it's safe, it goes to our limbic brain, compares it to past memories.  And then finally, it goes to our cortex.  It takes less than a second to get from the brainstem to the cortex, but it does take some time.  And so what is important to understand is that if you are in a situation where your vagus nerve is picking up through interalception, neuralception, and your five senses perception, all kinds of information that is available to your five senses and then his vibes.  And then it is bringing it in bottom up.  If it connects to something in your brainstem that triggers danger, it could also trigger a message from that time of danger.  And that message could be an intrusive thought.  And you are not even aware at a conscious level that this is happening because it's still in your brainstem.  It has not come to your conscious brain yet.  And with that memory that has been triggered by something subconsciously, you now have an intrusive thought.  There's another piece here that is important to understand.  So complex trauma can result in a person having deep shame, which results in a powerful inner critic or constant parents voice in your head.  So the stronger the shame, the parents voice in your head, the more you get thoughts uninvited, unwelcome into your mind.  So if you think of a person with deep shame that hates themselves, that does not like themself, that always has felt they are less than not good enough that everybody hates them and is going to reject them and abandon them and they are constantly putting themself down.  They can as they go throughout their day and something just happens to them and all of a sudden you are a loser, all of a sudden you should kill yourself.  It just is the messages of that deep shame that just pop into their head.  Or if they grew up with a very critical, angry parent who had not dealt with their own issues, they might have heard growing up, a parent said, saying, we would be better off without you or do us a favor and disappear from our lives.  Or you killed your mother and I wished you were dead.  And all of a sudden they are in a stressful situation today or they are in a situation where they feel a bit of embarrassment or insecurity and all of a sudden that parent's voice pops back into their head.  I wish you were dead.  We would be better off without you.  So deep shame, powerful inner critic, powerful parent's voice still in your head can cause troubling intrusive thoughts.  There's another way to look at this from the perspective of a complex trauma and that is to really see that some intrusive thoughts come from deep unresolved hurts and deep unmet needs.  They have looked at parents who have intrusive thoughts.  Parents who all of a sudden I just want to run away from home.  I do not, I am going to leave my husband, my kids, I am running away or I just want to kill myself.  Leave my husband and my kids or I just wish my kids, I did not have kids anymore, wish my kids drowned.  So they have looked at that and these parents that get these thoughts feel so guilty but those thoughts are so overwhelming and so powerful to them.  So here's what they find.  What happens when you are parenting children from kind of infancy to their midlate teens is that much of your life is very busy and the focus is responsibility to care for these lives and trusted to you and you put your own needs and your own wounds aside.  Just sweep them under the rug because you do not have time to deal with all of that stuff.  Your life is stressful with all of the needs of others and so what happens is you have all these needs that are not being met in your own life because you are not properly taking care of yourself.  You have wounds that need to be addressed but you do not have time to address them but they are still there in your subconscious and they can grow in hunger.  They can grow in saying give me attention and so once in a while they are going to pop thoughts into your head that will solve the problem of all this extra stress so that they can finally get attention and so it's like you are in your limbic brain, your little child's brain that's just looking for a solution to not getting its needs met and it's like if all my siblings were dead then I would get attention and then my needs would get met.  It's the very childish limbic brain looking at very simplistic solutions but that's what's popping into your head as an adult because you are in your limbic brain due to stress due to not meeting your needs and taking care of yourself the way that you should.  So hopefully what you are seeing is the purpose of these intrusive thoughts when you look at it through the lens of complex trauma is that these thoughts were actually there to protect you, to keep you safe when that little child was in danger when that little child was with unresolved problems and unmet needs.  These thoughts got implanted in their implicit memory as possible solutions to their situation and they were all about keeping the child safe.  Or another way to look at that is we have seen over and over that the purpose of the brain is to keep you safe but also that you would experience joy, that you would experience true happiness.  So if the brain is in a place of discontent or pain it cannot relax.  It is going to start exploring solutions to solve the pain and the discontent so it's going to look at option A and if that's not a viable option it goes to option B and if that's not viable it goes to option C.  So let's say it goes through 50 different options to solve your discontent or pain and not one of them is been viable.  Then it starts getting into more bizarre, more extreme type solutions that is just popping into your head as this could be a solution and bring you back to a place of no pain and happiness.  So your brain is just doing its job trying to protect you, trying to keep you happy and safe and without pain.  I think you are all hopefully also seeing why these thoughts when they pop into your head for some people become more distressing than for others and that is really the people with deep shame issues.  When they get a thought like this they already feel not good about themselves, they already feel they are not good enough and so when this thought comes into their head they just automatically assume okay that proves I am not good enough, that proves I am a terrible person and it feeds shame and that shame then compounds the distress that they feel internally when that thought comes.  Instead of being able to say well that's a weird thought I am not interested in that that's not a solution and just moving on the shame person goes I just had this thought what's that say about me that must say I am a terrible person and now huge stress and anxiety take place and so what then happens is it actually feeds shame it makes shame grow even more.  Now I need to add just one little distinction piece here there's a distinction between rumination or obsessive thinking and intrusive thoughts both come out of complex trauma so we have looked at intrusive thoughts rumination or obsessive thinking so hamster will thinking just going over and over stuff in your mind not able to turn your brain off exploring solutions and solution after solution and never finding a solution getting paralyzed by over analysis that is definitely a piece of complex trauma but I hope you can see that that's not intrusive thoughts that's just a brain endlessly trying to find solutions or endlessly operating out of fear and so it could be the person who's living with unrelenting standards and so that's constantly I should be doing this I should be doing this I should be doing this I should be doing this or a person who's low self-esteem and got all these negative messages from childhood I am not good enough what a failure I am I cannot do anything right and those just replay replay replay so those are very much a part of complex trauma as well but they are distinct in a way from intrusive thoughts and truce of thoughts you are going through your day thinking quite healthy and then all of a sudden these thoughts that are very disturbing pop into your mind but both of these types of thoughts are all about protecting you so the fear of thoughts is what about this we better be prepared for this make sure we do this all of that and truth is truce of thoughts are deep memories from the past that were necessary back then to try to protect the child that pop back into your adult life so if you have gotten truce of thoughts if you have felt the distress that they cause if it's caused you to go to even deeper shame and feeling like you are a terrible person what do you do about it so let me begin with many of the intrusive thoughts come out of implicit memories way from the past stuff that's in your subconscious brain stuff that you might not even have a memory of what they are finding is the best way to access these memories is not top down through your cortex but through therapeutic modalities that are bottom up that that help calm your brain stem and limbic brain and heal them and then some of these memories get released to you so that's mindfulness breathwork yoga biofeedback somatic therapies sensory based interventions all of those are bottom-up approaches that sometimes help begin to release memories that help you understand where some of these intrusive thoughts are coming from but in the here and now people who are bothered by intrusive thoughts really it boils down to they need to learn a new relationship to their thoughts they need to learn that sometimes the contents of thoughts carry weight sometimes they do not they are totally irrelevant they are not important they do not need to be listened to and so not all thoughts have equal weight not all thoughts need the same response that's what we are wanting to learn second thing that people need to understand is sometimes we bring a thought to our mind we initiate the process in our brain to think of something but in many cases we do not initiate thoughts coming into our brain that's important to understand thoughts can just pop into our brain unbidden we did not initiate anything and so it's again realizing our brain as many parts each part is doing its job once in a while some of those parts which are working subconsciously are going to release a thought to our conscious mind and it could be in total disagreement with what we really believe and think so do not get upset the brain is just being the brain it is just doing its job it does not mean that you are bad it's just means there's parts of the brain that are processing differently from kind of who you are as a person and over time that can be healed the next thing that is so important understand is you cannot control many of the thoughts that pop into your brain but you can control what you do with them once they pop into your brain and that basically means you can feed them or not feed them you can give them weight or not give them weight you can give them total attention or you can ignore them you can focus on them or you can redirect your mind to something else that's the part you control you do not control whether or not a thought pops into your brain but you control what you do with it so many people have worked on this and pulled together a list of here's what you can do so some have found it helpful to recognize and label the thoughts for what they are oh that's an intrusive thought I cannot control that that can be very helpful to put that label on it then you can just let them stay instead of trying to push them away except that they will eventually pass give a bit of time for that to happen because they will fade away and just keep doing what you are doing and not feed into it and as you do that it's just going to gradually pass away that's going to be the process and if you realize that that process will happen then that will help you not panic when the intrusive thought comes just oh ignore it just keep doing what I am doing think about something else and they will just pass away but be prepared that they are going to come back that's just how the brain works so do not get upset go oh that thoughts back the brain is still working through stuff second thing is do not do these things do not engage with these thoughts do not give them away do not try to question why you are having them do not look for meaning behind them do not try to stop them doing any of those things is fixating on the thoughts it is feeding the thoughts it is actually making it worse just oh well that's intrusive thought okay let it pass and it will just get less and less somebody said this in reality a thought even a scary thought is not an impulse the problem is not one of impulse control it is over control they are opposite ends of the continuum however sufferers get bluffed by their anxiety so here's that anxiety piece again and they become desperate for reassurance so they get this thought they think is that an impulse or not is that an impulse or not well the only way I can be sure of that is I must control this thought there you just fed the thought there you just made things worse but their desire for reassurance that this is not them that they are not going to act on an impulse actually makes things worse so reassurance only works temporarily people can become reassurance junkies and that's not a good thing the only way to effectively deal with intrusive obsessive thoughts is by reducing one sensitivity to them not by being reassured that it will not happen again or that it's not true unwanted intrusive thoughts are reinforced by getting entangled with them worrying about them struggling against them trying to reason them away they are also made stronger by trying to avoid them because that's partly fixating on them leave the thoughts alone treat them as if they are not even interesting and they will eventually fade into the background let me end with a study that was done in 1970 by Walter Michelle at Stanford University and so it was putting children preschool children in a room where a man would give them toys to play with for a while and then the man would have two plates one with two marshmallows on it one with one marshmallow on it and what the man said was that he was going to leave the room and for just a little while and leave the children with the two plates the two marshmallows on one and the one marshmallow on the other and what he said to them is if they could wait until he comes back then he would let them have the plate with the two marshmallows but if they just could not wait for the man to come back and really wanted the marshmallows they could ring a bell and then they could have the plate but it would be the plate with one marshmallow and so that was the test that was done and what they found and it's just fascinating is that the children who were able to wait until the man came back and got the two marshmallows they tracked those children they tracked the children that could not wait and ended up with the one marshmallow and the children that were able to wait they did better in adult life they did better in getting careers they get better and staying out of trouble with the law and they are going what was going on in that small child's mind that enabled them to wait and able to eventually get the two marshmallows and what they found is that the children had some internal tool already some internal mechanism that enabled them to not focus on the marshmallows but to distract themselves and focus on something else they were able to resist the temptation by not feeding it by focusing on they were able to direct their minds to other things and become focused on those things and that enabled them to enjoy those other activities and not get drawn into feeding the temptation so somebody has put it this way it's like you are writing on an elephant you want the elephant to turn to the left but the elephant wants to turn to the right so now you have two powerful wheels each wanting to do the opposite so how does a skilled writer get to get a powerful elephant to turn and do what the writer wants when it actually is wanting to do the opposite well you do not enter into a contest of wheels with an elephant the elephant will always win and so the point is this you do not try to enter into a contest of wheels with your subconscious mind with your conscious mind trying to conquer your subconscious mind you will never win that fight what they have found is the skilled writer the skilled conscious mind is able to distract the elephant to get incentives and stimuli that cause the elephant to want to go in the other direction and so what we have to do when these intrusive thoughts come is get our mind focused on healthy things things that give us joy things that feed us soul feed our soul things that make us want to go in this healthy direction and eventually our subconscious mind cooperates so understand that your thoughts have no power over you your thoughts are thoughts it's what you do with the thoughts how much weight you give them that determines the power that they have so you can decide what to do with these thoughts how much weight to give them you can train your mind to respond to different stimuli to focus on different things it's going to take time it might take help but it is possible to do it but underneath all of that be working on the trauma that if unresolved had to create these thoughts to try to protect you and as you heal your trauma you will find that some of these thoughts will begin to just disappear on their own well that's the end of another Friday night I hope that is helpful for you.
