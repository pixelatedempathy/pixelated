- Chunk-based processing to avoid memory issues
- Performance metrics tracking
- Configurable worker count

### ðŸŽ¯ **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION**

**New Methods Added**:
```python
_get_enhanced_clinical_patterns()          # 200+ pattern expansion
_extract_semantic_concepts()               # Contextual extraction
_extract_colloquial_expressions()          # Informal language detection
_parallel_process_transcripts()            # Multi-core processing
_process_single_transcript_optimized()     # Enhanced single processing
_merge_parallel_results()                  # Result aggregation
```
