All of those things are there.

So the very strategies necessary to survive as a child make healthy relationships impossible.

So here's an important summary for you.

Codependency develops in an emotionally abusive environment with a narcissist being abusive.

And it develops in an emotionally dishonest environment because the enabler is never going to get honest about how things really are.

And so a child is growing up in an environment that is emotionally abusive and emotionally dishonest.

So how are they going to learn to be emotionally honest and emotionally healthy?

They didn't have that taught to them, so they set that aside in their life.

So here's a quote that I love.

Soul wounds, so again, emotional wounds are what take place in an emotionally abusive environment.

Soul wounds do not heal if ignored.

And what I want you to understand with that is a lot of people coming out of complex trauma say, why deal with that?

That's in the past.

And what this is saying is you can ignore those wounds, but it's still going to mess up your relationships today.

So soul wounds do not heal if you ignore them.

They continue to shape and govern our emotions, our self-image, our ways of interacting in relationship long beyond the childhood in which they were received.

Shame does damage far beyond the original dysfunction because it has damaged the wounded souls unintentionally, continually.

They continue to perpetrate on themselves.

It is a kind of soul murder.

What it's saying is this.

If you don't deal with your soul wounds, guess what?

You're going to get in relationships and you're going to wound yourself.

And you're going to murder your own soul.

And in other words, what it is saying is complex trauma, you develop a system that lets you survive physically, but it murders your soul.

You're physically alive, soul dead.

That's what comes out of complex trauma.

And so when you go into a relationship physically alive, soul dead, it's impossible not just to have a healthy relationship, but it's impossible not to wound each other and yourself further.

And you do even further damage.

So somebody has said, codependency is the dance of wounded souls.

And I think that says it.

I think that says it very well.

Another person has said, codependency is using relationships today to try and meet emotional needs not met in childhood.

I said to the clients this week, what many of you will probably find is you're going to wake up one morning and you say, I think I married my mom or I think I married my dad.

Because I'm still looking for them to validate me and meet my needs today.

I married somebody that was like them without realizing it, hoping they would solve my soul wounds.

And they won't.

They will just make it worse.

So an attempt to heal one's shame by ignoring your internal world and focusing on finding Mr.

Perfect does not work.

But that's what codependency is all about trying to do.

So that's just a taste of codependency.

For the Christian part, one of the things that we've been really building on for, do you realize it's a year ago that we started at Riverwood here?

So we've been working at this for about a year.

But we've been really focusing on what does it mean to have a relationship with God?

What does it mean to trust God?

What's this living by faith in God?

And part of the challenge for people coming out of complex trauma is for many of them they were experiencing spiritual abuse.

And so to them, God's not a trustworthy person.

And so one of the things I decided I was going to do for a couple weeks is some of the issues that people have when it comes to trusting God, partly because of distortions, is the damage that they've received from other Christians.

And it just gets me really upset and often I'll break into rants that some of you will find amusing, others it gets me in trouble.

But I get really upset with a lot of the damage that churches and Christians have done as far as how they've explained God to people.

So tonight, what I want to do is talk about probably the most common distortion people get through a church environment and that is that God is an angry God.

And you will get verses about God's anger or God's wrath and that is used to prove that this God is an angry God and therefore you should fear Him because of His anger.

Do you realize that what that does is it makes church like a dysfunctional complex trauma family?

How do you motivate children in a complex trauma family?

You put fear into them.

How do you motivate children in a healthy family?

You put love into them.

How does it work within a church when you want to get people to follow God?

You put fear into them.

And that makes it a sick place.

And so that has done so much damage that I want to talk about that because it leads to the next thing.

And that is you need to be afraid.

I grew up hearing, oh be careful little hands what you do because there's a father up above looking down in peace and love.

Well I didn't hear there's a father up above looking down in peace and love.

I heard there's a father up above and if he's looking down and if you do something bad you better watch out.

Because he could just bring out his baseball bat and just smack you really good just because you pissed him off that day.

That's not what I meant.

That's not what I meant.

And so that was this God with an unpredictable anger who lashed out in judgment at times on a whim.

And that was the environment that I suspect some of you were raised in.

I say to people all the time that I would guess based on what I do here in Manitoba that probably 25% of the people I work with have been given a picture of God like that.

And that is spiritual abuse.

Because now what does that narcissist dad do?

He says, here's a Bible verse that says you better do what I'm telling you to do or else God's not, not only am I going to judge you, God's going to judge you.

So now I got God on my side, so you better be afraid.

And that creates complex trauma.

So here's the first thing you need to understand.

When you read through the Bible, what you're going to find is there's two types of God's anger that are talked about.

So let me back you up and give you this.

If you don't know me, I went to church even before I was born when I was in my mom's womb.

I went to church minimum of five times a week ever since I was a newborn.

So I was raised in church and I was raised in kind of the normal Christian teachings of Western society.

I bought into all of that until I became very ill and I went into a deep depression that lasted almost ten years.

And all of a sudden, all of those things that I was taught didn't work.

And so I had to back away from the Christianity that I was raised with and go, most of that I don't believe anymore, it doesn't work.

I need to find out what works.

And that caused me to reread the Bible through the eyes of pain and the eyes of depression and the eyes of unresolved physical problems.

And all of a sudden the Bible took on a whole new meaning to me.

Because I saw it through the eyes that the original recipients of the Bible read it from.

Do you realize that the Bible wasn't written for people in comfortable places?

It was written for people who were in pain.

And as you read it, all of a sudden, everything you see differently.

And one of the first things I began to see was we've misunderstood God's anger.

And we've used God's anger in an abusive way that God never designed.

So the first part of God's anger is what I call passive anger.

So here's how it works.

Sometimes when it's passive, someone says God is angry at people.

It doesn't mean he's up there saying, oh, I just want to get them.

What it means is this.

When he designed life, he says, I am going to create life so that if you live within the boundaries of love in a healthy design, you're going to get positive consequences.

You're going to experience positive emotions, positive relationships, and many blessings.

If you step outside of those boundaries and start to lie and start to be abusive, guess what you're going to get?

Pain.

Now that's the first way of describing God's anger is nothing more than the natural consequences that God built into unloving actions.

So God's not up in heaven doing anything.

He just built it into how life is designed.

Now think about it further.

Why did God put painful consequences if you step outside of love?

Is it so you go, oh God, you're a mean God?

No, it's say, oh, I need to get back inside of healthy.

Because if I stay outside of here, it's going to be pain, and it's going to become hell on earth.

But if I get back inside of healthy, I'll get back to joy and blessing.

So actually, negative consequences that feel like God is angry are actually God loving you, saying, I don't want you out here because it'll destroy you.

I want to make this super uncomfortable so you'll come back to what I designed.

So all of that pain comes out of a loving heart.

So that's not even anger.

That's a loving God trying to stop people from destroying themselves.

So that's the first thing you need to understand.

So if you now read through the Bible, and you read every time you see God's anger, guess what you're going to see most of the time?

It's nothing more than painful consequences that are built into life.

Now let me take that further.

In Romans 1, there's a passage that says, people step outside of God's design, and they basically said, we're not going to submit to God, surrender to God.

We want to be our own boss, so we're going to do it our way.

We think God's rules are designed to take the fun out of life.

We think fun is outside of God's design, so we're going to go out there.

And they did that, and they got pain.

But instead of going back to inside, it says they hardened their heart, and they got more rebellious.

And many of you understand that.

And so they said, we're going to go even further outside of God's design, because we think there'll be happiness there.

And so it says God gave them up.

He says, I don't want you to do that.

I'm trying to bring you back through painful consequences.

You're hardening your heart, so I'll let you go.

I'll let you go like a parent would a rebellious child, and says, you're not going to learn from me telling you or giving you consequences.

Okay, go ahead.

And you're going to find out it's not like you thought it's going to be.

And so God gave them up.

He gives them up to their own will.

I'll give you what you want, even though I know it will destroy you, because you won't listen to what I say is best for you.

So that is not a God who's angry, saying, I'm going to punish you.

It's a God who has a breaking heart.

It's a God who is saying, don't do this.

But the only way you're going to learn your way doesn't work is the pain has to get so bad that you finally stop and say, maybe I'm not the smartest person in the world.

And that's the only way some of us learn, and you know all about that.

So that is not an angry God.

That is a loving God, but painful consequences sometimes feel like anger.

And so that's why it's called that.

The second thing is there are just a few occasions in the Bible where God moved in active judgment and he wiped out some people.

Okay?

So just to give you a, there's two things I want you to understand with that.

The first is, so let's say my wife had terrible cancer and she went in yesterday and the surgeon said, you know what, I should probably cut all of that out, but I'm going to be nice.

I don't want to cause her any pain, so I'll just put a bandaid over top of it.

That's not a loving doctor.

A loving doctor would do radical surgery.

And so the times when you see God wipe out people, he's wiping out a cancer that would destroy the earth.

Okay?

That's part one.

Part two, when you see the times, and I'm going to give you the three examples, when God did wipe it out, what you find it was the last thing he wanted to do, and he only did it when nobody else would listen, when every single person, every single person hardened their heart.

So in 2 Peter 3 it says this, the Lord is not slow in keeping his promise.

Instead, he is patient with you, not wanting anyone to perish.

In other words, the last thing God wants to do is judge.

That is what he will avoid as long as possible.

He wants everybody to come back inside healthy.

So that is the heart desire of God.

So that's important because God's not up there saying, I'm so mad I can't wait to beat somebody up.

God is up there saying, the last thing I want to do is judge a person.

What more could I try to help bring them back?

And so he will try all kinds of different things to bring them back.

Okay, so let me give you example number one.

Genesis 6, Noah and the flood.

Okay?

So basically the story goes, God said to Noah, build an ark, get two of all the animals because I'm going to wipe out the world.

Why?

Because everybody is living, eat, drink and be merry.

What does that mean?

They're only living to indulge every selfish desire they have.

They are no longer loving.

This world has become unsafe and destructive because everybody is totally self-centered.

Okay?

And so, I have to cut out this cancer.

But then he says this, I don't want to.

So there's a very interesting thing.

I don't know if you remember from Sunday school, but we used to get the oldest person in the bible was one of the quizzes.

And it's a guy by the name of Methuselah.

And you, that will be on the test, Methuselah.

But he lived to be 969 years old.

So that was the oldest guy that ever lived.

You want to know what Methuselah's name means?

When he dies, it will come.

And if you go through the story, there's a genealogy.

And what you find is you go through it, the year Methuselah died, the flood came.

When he dies, it will come.

But that's interesting to me because he was the oldest guy that ever lived.

And so it's like this saying, I don't want to, God saying, I don't want to judge the world yet.

You know what?

I'm going to let Methuselah live another year.

The next year, I'm going to let Methuselah live another year.

And so, I'm going to let Methuselah live another year.

The next year, I just don't want to judge them yet.

I want to give them another chance.

I'll let them live another year.

And then he lived another year and another year.

And what you see in that is God is doing everything to prevent having to judge people.

He's giving every possible chance.

The next time it happens is in Genesis 19, the story of Sodom and Gomorrah, where fire, it said, came down from heaven.

I've been to where Sodom and Gomorrah is.

There was a huge volcanic eruption, which would have been the fire from heaven, that wiped out the entire city, kind of like a Pompeii.

And so, it's not actually even God doing stuff.

It's a natural disaster that just happened to work at that time to wipe out that messed up people.

But what is important is this.

In Genesis 19, God comes to Abraham and he says, I got to cut out the cancer of Sodom and Gomorrah.

And so, it says this, the Lord said to Abraham, the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah is so great, their sin so grievous, that I'm going to come down and see if what they have done is bad as the outcry that has reached me.

Then Abraham says this.

He starts to argue with God.

And it's important to understand that God's okay if we argue with him.

Okay?

As long as we listen.

But he says, will you sweep away the righteous with the wicked?

So what he's thinking and fearing is you're going to destroy that wickedness.

And he says, I'm going to do that.

But there's going to be all kinds of people still that want to follow you.

Would you come down and wipe out all these people?

And I get bothered at times when people say, Jesus is coming back tomorrow and he's going to do this judgment.

I go, really?

There's so many people still that I see with open hearts that just haven't heard yet.

I don't see them up there ready to come and do that.

But that's Abraham's concern.

So he says, will you spare the people that are still there?

There's 50 good people still left.

And God says, no, if there's 50 people left, I will spare the whole place.

Then he says, okay, how about 45?

And God says, no, I won't judge it.

Okay, how about 40?

And they go in this argument.

How about 30?

How about 20?

How about 10?

And God said, if there's 10 people, I will not wipe this out.

So what he is saying is there was one.

Well, there was one lot.

But that's all.

So I am only wiping it out because there's nobody left with an open heart.

If there is anybody left with an open heart more than that lot, I would give them another chance.

And so what you see is that the judgment doesn't come until everybody within that culture has closed their heart to God.

And they are no longer open to being to God at all.

And then the final one very quickly.

In Genesis 15, Israel comes out of Egypt, we've talked about, and they're going to this land that God has promised.

And what God says is, I am going to have you go into that land and engage in battle.

And you're going to wipe out a lot of people in battle.

Okay?

So here's the logic behind it.

Know for certain that for 400 years, your descendants will be strangers in the land.

They will be slaves in a country not their own.

And that they will be enslaved and mistreated there.

So Israel was slaves in Egypt for 400 years.

In the fourth generation, your descendants will come back here.

Why are you taking them out of here, putting them for 400 years in a foreign culture, in a protected bubble?

He says this, because the Amorites' wickedness has not reached its full measure.

What he is saying is, they're bad right now, and if I let you live amongst them, they'd corrupt you.

So I'm going to take you out to protect you, but the reason I'm doing that is, I don't want to judge them right away because I want to keep giving them a chance.

Well, how long are you going to keep giving them a chance?

400 years.

Wow, that's a lot of patience.

And so God doesn't wipe that out until he gives them 400 extra years of chance and he puts his people in slavery to take them away from all of that corruption and then he brings them back.

So those three examples, what you begin to realize is we don't have this angry God whose tempers are always flaring.

We don't have a God who's quick to judge people and wipe them out.

We get the exact opposite picture in the Bible.

And that is so important for people who have received spiritual life.

And that is spiritual abuse to understand.

So God gives these people tons and tons of warnings and lots of times.

So let me quickly, what does God do to try to get people's attention?

He gives you a conscience.

So you tell a lie and it bugs you like crazy.

And then he gives parents and their design is to help keep you in healthy.

Complex trauma, they don't do that very well.

Then he gives you a government called police and all of that and they try and make laws that help you stay in healthy and know that it's painful to go outside of healthy.

Cultures get that all messed up too.

And then there's the natural consequences outside of that.

All of those four things are designed by God to get people's attention that it pays to be inside of healthy.

Okay, so that's what he does.

And then he doesn't judge until he gives them every possible opportunity.

And if you look at it, just like Jesus when he came on the scene, the whole mindset of the religion was of an angry God.

And so they lived in fear of this angry God that you had to be careful that you made enough sacrifices to keep them happy.

And if you ever broke a rule, you had to run and make a couple sacrifices to get them to not judge you.

And Jesus comes on the scene and basically, as you read through his teaching, through these eyes that I've given you tonight, see that what he was doing is saying, I want to give you a whole new understanding of God.

He is not this angry God.

And he tells the story of the prodigal son.

And it's a son who does this.

He says, dad, give me my inheritance now.

And dads didn't give their inheritance to their children until they died.

And what he was saying is, dad, I wish you were dead.

And then it says he goes to a foreign country and he does the exact opposite of what his dad stood for.

So in other words, he flipped his dad the bird and he says, I want nothing to do with you.

I'm going to do everything I can to break your heart and do it outside of your design.

Now the Jews listening to that would think that father is going to be so angry at that son.

He would never forgive him, never allow him to come back.

Because he's going to punish him and he's going to punish him big time.

And Jesus says, uh-uh, uh-uh, uh-uh.

That's not what happened.

And so he goes out of his way.

So you have to understand in that time, it was a shame-based culture.

And what that meant was a man, especially an older man, never did anything in public that would mess up his image.

You always carried yourself very circumspectly.

So that meant an older man would never run.

He would never hug somebody in public, never kiss somebody in public because you had to look good.

And so when this man whose sons trashed him and done the exact opposite and wished he was dead, when he sees him coming up the road, guess what he does?

He runs, he hugs him, and he kisses him, and then he throws a party for him.

And what he is saying to the people is this is the exact opposite God of what you were taught.

And that is what I want you to hear is if you got that other God, get rid of that.

That's what Jesus was about was to destroy that old view of God that is part of a complex trauma, spiritual abuse world, and begin to understand that God's anger is totally a different thing.

And the God is a loving God and a forgiving God.
