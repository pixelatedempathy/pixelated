- **CRITICAL NOTE**: The IMHI dataset used to train MetaAligner-IMHI is not publicly available
- _Alternatives_: Consider leveraging public datasets such as [CLPsych 2015 Shared Task](https://clpsych.org/shared-task-2015/), [EmpatheticDialogues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EmpatheticDialogues), [Mental Health Reddit Dataset](https://zenodo.org/record/3609856), or internal datasets that meet privacy and compliance requirements. For proprietary or restricted datasets, reference or initiate [data-access requests](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/data/data-access-requests) as appropriate.
- Integration should focus on the general MetaAligner approach rather than the specialized IMHI variant
- Custom objective framework needed rather than relying on their specific trained objectives
- Post-processing approach allows integration with any existing model
- Consider using general MetaAligner models without relying on the specialized IMHI variant

**Dependencies:**

- Underlying LLM for initial response generation
- Objective definition framework
- Alignment evaluation metrics
- Integration with current mental health analysis system
- User interface for explainable alignment
