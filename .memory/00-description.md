# Pixelated Empathy Project Description

## Overview
Pixelated Empathy is an AI-powered platform that transforms digital conversations into actionable emotional intelligence. Unlike traditional sentiment analysis tools that merely categorize emotions, we decode the psychological patterns behind human communication to build genuine connection.

## Core Mission
To engineer empathy through technology - creating AI systems that don't just process conversations, but truly understand the emotional subtext, vulnerability, and authentic human needs expressed in digital interactions.

## Key Value Proposition
- **Emotional Cartography**: Maps the complete emotional journey of conversations, identifying trust-building moments, vulnerability signals, and connection points
- **Conversational Dynamics Engine**: Analyzes dialogue flow, tone patterns, response timing, and emotional reciprocity
- **Persona Intelligence**: Recognizes role shifts and adapts analysis accordingly (mentor, peer, help-seeker)
- **Empathy Gym™**: Risk-free training environment for mental health professionals to practice difficult conversations

## Technical Architecture
### Primary Stack
- **Frontend**: Astro 5.x + React 19 + TypeScript 5.x
- **Backend**: Node.js 24 + Express + WebSocket
- **AI Services**: Python 3.11+ with PyTorch, Transformers, HuggingFace
- **Database**: MongoDB 7.0 + Redis 5.x
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Cloudflare Workers
