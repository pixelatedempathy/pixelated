Do not bring your authentic self to work.  I want your professional self.  You can bring your authentic self to Thanksgiving meal with your family if you would like to.  Your authentic self is about who?  Me, me, me, me, me.  Everything is what's happening to me.  What's in it for me?  Do you know that you impact other people?  You affect other people's lives?  You make the work environment easier or more taxing?  Can someone learn to be a better self-regulator of their emotions?  Yes.  So I have been around former SEALs, U.  S.  Secret Service, presidents, and I learned a lot about communication, reading people, confidence.  And I will share these things.  So first of all, Ebi Pompouros is the former U.  S.  Secret Service agent.  From guarding presidents to reading liars, she now reveals the strategies she used to make anyone respect you, trust you, and give you what you want.  I have been around very confident people, and they had a really good circle around them, inner circle.  Because if you are exposing yourself to people and environments that are not good for you, that will actually impact your life negatively.  You know, I always say, be careful who you try to save.  Some people will drown you.  And then the other thing I would see presidents do is they were very good at delegating.  So they did not need to know everything, because confident people are okay with not knowing all the information.  So your brain is like a bathtub.  The bathtub can only hold so much water.  If you keep putting water in the bathtub, it's going to overflow.  That's your cognitive load.  My bathtub only holds the water it needs to hold in.  And another thing that the Secret Service taught us is that it's really important to use your hands.  Because when people do not see hands, it's a sign of untrustworthiness.  Like, you cannot trust them.  So when you see hands, open hands, I am no threat.  And then there's communication skills, manipulation tactics, and a strategy to make good decisions.  And I will go through them.

But the two most important things are.  To my regular listeners, I know you do not like it when I ask you to subscribe at the start of these conversations.  I do not like saying it.  I do not like it being in there.  None of us like it.  It's frustrating.  Do you know what's also frustrating?  It's also frustrating when I go into the back end of the YouTube channel, and I see that 56% of you that listen frequently to this podcast have not yet subscribed.  And so many of you do not even know that you have not subscribed.  Because I see in the comments section, you say to me, you go, I did not even realize I did not subscribe.  And that actually fuels the show.  It's basically like you are making a donation to the show.  So that's why I ask all the time, because it enables us to build and build and build and build.  And we are going for the long term here.  So all I would ask you is if you have seen this show before and you like it, help me, help my team here, hit the subscribe button, and we will continue to build this show for you.  That's my promise.  Thank you to all of you guys that do subscribe.  It means the world to me.  Let's get on with the show.  What is the overarching theme of why people you think are drawn to your particular message?  And what part of that message are they drawn to?  I get bombarded on all social media platforms and in email.  And it's always like, Evie, I have this problem.  Please help me.  And it can range from I have a problem communicating to I am in an abusive relationship to my brother was murdered.  And they are saying it's a suicide.  It's not.  I get everything.  And I think what I am seeing is there are a lot of people that are not doing well.  It seems to me that people are tired of being told that they have no control over the outcome of their lives and no control over their relationships.  Because when you tell people it's not your fault this happened to you and it's okay that you are this way, which it is, I think people do not want to stay there anymore.  And so people look to I do not have to be weak all the time or I do not have to feel weak.  You can have a weak moment.  It's not the same thing with feeling fundamentally weak or insecure or insignificant all the time.  And then looking at a moment or a situation or moments in your life and saying I am this way now because of all these things that happened.  And I think for a while that worked.  I think for a while people were buying it.  I think for a while people were buying it.  I think for a while people were buying it.  I think for a while people were buying it.  I think for a while people were buying it.  Because it's like it's not your fault that you are like this.  Now this happened to you here.  It's not your fault that you do not trust people.  This happened to you here.  And so because that theme's been going on for so long, what it does is it renders you powerless.  Because it's saying you are this way because of all this other stuff and it's not your fault.  And that translates to I have no power over it.  I am a result of what's happened to me.  And that's a powerless state.  And that's a powerless state.  It's a powerless state to be, which all it does is keep suppressing you down.  So you just stay there instead of saying, you know, it happened to you.  Okay, now where do we go from here?  And it's wild because I did consultations and mentor sessions for a window of time.  And I would only do either one or three.  I would not do more than that.  Because the most important thing, I did not want people to rely on me.  It's like, I will come in and I will give you some guideposts.

But my goal is not to make you reliant on me to keep coming in.  I want you to keep coming back to me.  Three was the max I would do with someone.  No more than that.  Three sessions.  Three sessions.  Three sessions.  Because my goal is if I keep you coming back to me, then I am not helping you.  All I am doing is reorienting you to come to me.  I am going to fix it for you.  My goal was always, no, you have the ability.  I might need to kind of shift things around or shake things up a little bit in your mindset.

But in the end, you are very well capable.  And most people are.  They just do not learn.  They just do not know how to trust themselves.  You talked about how using the past to diagnose your current self by saying, this happened to me, so I am this way, is almost, it's like a short-term friend in the moment because it kind of helps you feel heard and understood and it justifies the way that you are.

But it ends up being a long-term enemy in the context that you are then stuck with the results of who you are, for better or for worse.  And I was thinking about myself.  I was thinking all the ways that I have justified who I am today using something that happened in the past.  And actually, whenever I do that, it's like, oh, I am not doing it.  I am not doing it.  I am not doing it.  I am not doing it.  And I think that's actually, whenever I do that, it makes that behaviour, even if it's the byproduct of it is making me unhappy, really hard to change.  Like, it's very hard to change.  Like, if I say this happened when I was a kid and my dad was unorganised or whatever and messy, so I am a messy person, it's almost like etching it into cement or something.  Can I ask you a question?  Why does it matter?  I do not understand why we have to psychoanalyse everything we do.  I feel we waste so much time.  And trying to figure out I am like this today because of this, this and this.  Sometimes I have found there's no clear reason why.  There's no, there's nothing to make sense of.  Even sometimes when people try to assess, like, why does this person treat me this way?  Why that?  What did I do?  Why this?  Sometimes there are reasons.  And sometimes that person's just an asshole.  There's nothing analysed.  There's nothing to figure out.  There's nothing that I dive deep on.  That person, you just happen to fall on an asshole.  And that's okay.  Let's move on.  So there's moments where that exists too.

But I feel like we try so hard to figure it out that we do more damage.  And, you know, like, your brain is like a bathtub.  Your cognitive load is like a bathtub.  Think of this as a bathtub.  If you have a bathtub, the bathtub can only hold so much water.  If you keep putting water in the bathtub, right, it's going to overflow.  That's your cognitive load.  So if I have my cognitive load in my bathtub and I keep putting water, water, water, it's going to overflow.  It's the same thing when you put stuff in there.  I am going to add more stuff and more stuff and more stuff.  Your cognitive load is overflowing.  It's maxed.  You are inefficient.  You are sloppy.  You are not getting things done right.  If you are, you are just barely getting there.  You are everywhere.  You are stressed out.  You are frazzled.  Because you are maxed out.  You are beyond maxed out.  So everything I do, and I will tell you, I learned this from watching Presidents, I keep my load light.  My bathtub only holds the water it needs to hold in.  So it protects you from overextending yourself, stressing yourself, and it also keeps you from making bad decisions.  You make good decisions.  There's something called decision fatigue, where the more stuff I add, we think the busier I am, the better I am.  I am moving.  I am hustling.  I am doing all this stuff.  Look how maxed out I am.  Just because you are busy, it does not mean you are being perfect.  You are not productive.  Those two things are not synonymous.  So often people think leaders keep adding, adding.  No, you know what good leaders do?  And this is what, again, I have learned.  They take out of that bathtub.  They take out.  What can I do less of so I can be exceptional at the other things I do?  Really great example.  This is public knowledge so I can share it.  President Barack Obama, he had 30 of the same suits.  Why?  Why do you think?  30 of the same exact suits.  So he did not have to make so many decisions every day?  Yes.  He did not want to sit and figure out what he's going to wear.  It's a decision he did not have to make.  That keeps his bathtub light.  Think about all the decisions he had to make every single day.  I want a light bathtub.  Boop.  Take that thing out.  Lighten your bathtub.  So when you are overthinking and overanalyzing and trying to process all this stuff, you are maxing out that bathtub.  So how can you perform?  You do not have infinite resources.  You do not have an infinite cognitive load and you do not have an infinite emotional load.  Do not keep adding.  Your job is to take out so that the things you do do, you do exceptionally well and you are much more emotionally stable.  I think maybe one of the reasons why people are tempted to go back is they think that if they go back into their history and understand things, then they can change something in the present.  They can change their future.  So they think, you know, if I can figure out why I am low confidence, what happened to me, then I can do something today which is going to change tomorrow.  So I guess I would say, and again, I would see this from, I have done hundreds of mentor sessions.  I would tell them, where are you right now?  What do you do now?  And what do you want to change now?  So I am low confidence.  I move through the world as if I am trying to not take up too much space.  I feel like people.  People are rude to me and I just have bad luck.  I have bad luck with men.  I am pretending I am a woman.  I have bad luck with men.  And I just feel like people do not respect me enough.  And also I just feel like I do not get the credit I deserve.  I see everyone around me, Evie, getting more credit for doing less work.  Okay.  So this is great.  So this is probably a person that you cannot help.  Number one.  Why?  Because everything's bad.  Everything is bad.  And you will get those from time to time.  You will get those.  Everything's a problem.  And if everything's a problem, right now, if you get that persona, which it does exist, you get them.  That person does not want a solution.  Really?  No.  What do they want?  They want me to validate how they feel.  That's what they want.  They do not want a solution.  If everything's a problem, think of it this way.  If every bar I go to, I get into a fight, it's not the bar.  So when someone's like, I have this problem, this problem, this problem, this problem, this problem.  They are so set in who and how they are, they want to stay there.  Often people do want an audience.  Often people do want to be told, I am so sorry.  I feel so bad that happened to you.  Sometimes too, when bad things happen to us, we get a lot of attention as a result.  Let's say something really horrific happens.  And I have seen it with somebody.  Maybe you had a severe illness or lost a loved one.  When you are dealing with something like that, what happens, right?  Immediately people come to you.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  They are there to support you.  You feel good.

But then eventually people move on with their lives.  And then you get addicted to where did all that attention go?  I want some of it.  So what do I do?  I look for something else to be a problem so I can get more empathy, more sympathy, more attention.  And so there are people that get stuck in that cycle.  Good people.  I know good people who get stuck in that cycle, but I am also aware of them because every time I speak to them, something's not right.  I cannot help them.  I do not even bother trying to help them.  One.  They do not really ask me.  And so I am very aware.  I do not give unsolicited advice.  It's wrong.  It's not my place.  And if they want it, they will ask.  And then even then I am always very aware.  Is this even going to land on this person?  Because I am coming back to me, my bathtub's full.  So I cannot really invest all that energy in you.  If it's, I do not mean it to be cold, but if it's a waste of time.  There's two personas that I am thinking about.  One of them's personal to me, and then one of them's personal to one of my friends.  And before we started, you said one of the things you like is very specific examples.  So here's a specific example.  There's someone I know very well, extremely well.  I have known them pretty much my whole life.  And when they came to the UK, they experienced a lot of racial abuse because they came to the UK in like 1994.  They lived in an area that was all white and the abuse they experienced was very, very real.  The UK, the part of the UK they lived in became more diverse.  And over the years, they have been there for 20, 30 years.  And now the race, racial abuse has pretty much gone away.

But you would not, you would not think it because when you, if you met this person who did go through this abuse, so much of their identity became formed around that abuse.  So even though they now live in an area where there's no abuse, they still find a perpetrator.  They find perpetrators everywhere.  And actually I have come to believe with this particular person who I know very well.  That their identity depends upon it.  And that's kind of what I was hearing in what you are saying is there's, I do not think this person could survive if they did not have a perpetrator anymore.  And so much so that they have started finding perpetrators in their own family and their whole family has now almost cut this person off because you know, their identity is being a survivor and like a hero, heroic survivor.  And now that the enemy has gone, so much depends on that identity that, you know, they are going to be.  This person's at war at home and they do not speak to their kids, their grandkids, and they have lost all of their family because they have now convinced that the stepmother is racist and the other step, you know, the other daughter-in-law is racist.  And this person said this thing, which is racist or is abusive towards me.  And you see this in a lot of people that, you know, maybe they did go through something, but now they need that thing to hold their identity in place.  So you reminded me of a story, which I will tell you, but here's the thing.  If you are looking for a problem, you will always find one.  You will always find a problem.  And that's the thing.  So it's the mindset.  What do I do about that person if I am a bystander?  Nothing.  Really?  Nothing.  I do not try and help them, change them?  No, because did he or she ask you?  No.  Do not do it.  Why?  Because they are not, they do not want it.  And you might end up upsetting them anyway.  They might get even angrier from it because they are in a space where they are so emotional and self-focused and they want to live there.  Do you know too?  When you ruminate, like you, you, it activates parts of the brain that make you feel alive.  Think of it this way.  You get like, you get hits.  You know how you get dopamine hits?  I feel good from certain things.  Well, you get a hit when you, even when you are angry or upset, you ever get so upset or angry and you get worked up?  What do you, adrenaline hit?  Your cortisol is going up.  What do you do?  I feel alive.  I am here.  I am there.  That feels good too.  It's a different type of feel, but I feel present.  I feel this.  I feel like I feel something.  So unless somebody comes to you and I have learned this lesson and says, Steven, I want your advice.  I would not give it one.  You are going to be exhausted.  You are doing so many things.  You do not have that ability to the person's not, they are not there to hear it.  So you also have to have someone who wants your, your guidance or advice.  So even when I did mentor sessions or consultations, it probably be like several times where I knew I was like, this is a waste of my time.  I am going to give you a full refund.  I am not for you because I understood.  I am like this person is not, they are not registering.  There's you did not remind me of a story.  I remember once I was doing a new story.  And I went and I interviewed somebody who was part of the cleanup efforts for nine 11, right?  September 11th cleanup efforts.  And he was doing all this stuff to, you know, present day to help victims of nine 11 today.  And I was like, I am going to give you a full refund.  I am not for you.  And you know, I am not for you.  I am not for you.  And I am not for you.  So I gave him the full refund.  And he's like, I am going to give you a full refund.

But I am not for you.  I am not for you.  I am not for you.

But I have my own experience.  I am not, I have had my own experience with nine 11.  I worked at the world trade center.  That's when your field office was.  I was there on that day.  I lost colleagues and friends, but this person knows nothing about this.  So I show up and I am getting them ready and we are talking.  And there's this big, , tower tattoo, the towers nine 11 tattoo is I am making up the person, the towers.  There was a room in the house home.  That had all this 9-11 memorabilia like a whole room and i remember being there thinking okay this person must have had some really serious trauma exposure and i am not trying to minimize so i spoke to them this person and he had some kind of injury as well and i said oh tell me about it well i was there and i was injured when i was welding something kind of fell on my foot and as a result i had to go on some kind of disability and i said what happened to your foot and it was i think he had lost like his toe or something his pinky and i said okay and i said how long were you there three days i said were you there for the day of the event no so you were not there for the day of the event so your exposure to 9 11 was three days and then you got injured yes okay so i am clocking this internally to myself his whole life was something that was really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i am saying that i am not a person who's never been hurt by something that's really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i am saying that i am not a person who's never been hurt by something that's really hard for me to deal with and i think that's why i am saying that i am not a person who's never been hurt about around the drama the the trauma the the overcoming 9 11 everything was 9 11 9 11 9 11 and it was such an identity space he was so it was all like such a horrible thing for him and i am thinking it was not to minimize but i am thinking how did you build your whole livelihood present day around that small event but that was his identity i thought i remember thinking i am like i did the interview and i had to go i was like oh my god i am going to go to the hospital i am going to go to the hospital i am going to go to the hospital i was like i cannot be around this because he was just so self-focused on how bad that experience was that everything he did and who he was to the point where you have tattoos on your body of the world trade center and i am thinking how is this helping you move forward there's this concept in psychology called secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about i am writing this book at the moment so i was i wrote a chapter about secondary gain and it basically says exactly what you are saying there's this concept in psychology called secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about secondary gain that i was i was writing a book about exactly what you are describing which is there's always a secondary gain from pain typically there's like something you benefit from it and the problem is people can get addicted to that and sometimes it's like safety or comfort that you get from it sometimes it's identity and sometimes it's remuneration you know might be money or other rewards the other example that i was going to say in terms of personas that i am aware of is the kid who is in his bedroom and cannot leave his bedroom because he says you know there's something wrong with him he might be clinically obese or have some kind of other issue and his family around him are his support network and i actually know someone in this situation where they just do not leave their bedroom and the mother i think she's also getting her identity from being the mother with that child who she's propping up and it was it was interesting that in this particular case with one of my best friends who lives in the middle east when she stopped doing that when she actually heard something on this podcast and stopped propping this person up enabling enabling them this person got better very very quickly got better because she basically said i am not going to i cannot help anymore and also do not talk to me about this i do not have that as you say like the cognitive energy anymore this person got better and it made me realize that you know sometimes two people can keep one person trapped they can i am the mother i am the savior that is protecting my child who is unwell and the child is being the cared for and both of the people are getting love and attention and affection from that sort of abusive unhealthy relationship a lot of people find themselves there we think about sometimes the attention you get i am so sorry i am so sorry that happened to you that's so sad that can become addicting because you are constantly looking for it but again i i have come to accept people as they are i also look at who am i to tell you to be different if this is where you like to live and how you like to live live it i think where it becomes a problem for folks is when it bleeds into your own life so like with a mom where she had that moment she's like i do not want to do this anymore because it's impacting my life then i can understand that because she's like i do not want to participate in this but i just have found like i want you to think of it this way like it's like think of a an iceberg think of an iceberg you see the top of the iceberg the little blip at the top of the the water and then the the big part underneath which is the vast majority of what makes an iceberg we are like that when you see another human being i want you to think of like got this huge bottom portion of this iceberg that you do not see and it's who makes them what they are so one the things that make you who you are today are all the things that have accumulated over the entire time span of your life family is a huge one did you have family were they good family did you have one parent both parents did you have any parents right a friend who are your friends growing up who are your friends now your experiences your dramas your traumas all those things make you who you are your values your belief systems your personality do you know that personality in a human being forms in infancy so all these things make you up even your age who you are today is probably vastly different steven than who you were five years ago versus 10 years ago versus 15 years ago that's somebody's iceberg so when you take all of that you have that iceberg do you think you are going to roll in and within what a couple hours a couple conversations you are going to get them to what shift that's what you are up against so often people become very upset because they cannot change other people and that's why i am like accept what you had i give a keynote literally this week and a woman came to me in tears at the end this was at a business conference so this was for business for communication and a very different thing but she she came up to me afterward she said i really want a guidance from you i said sure what is it are you okay she said i have a husband and he's very overweight and i have done everything i can to try to get him to change and i want to try to use these influence strategies on him to change him that you talked about could you help guide me i said how long have you been dealing with this she's like oh a long time years i said does he want to change no she's like but i try and i do not want to give up i said did you see that park where i taught the part where i talked about the iceberg remember i showed you the iceberg and i said accept people as they are i said he's the iceberg i said it's not him that's the issue now it's you you are not accepting what you have in front of you that's what he is unless you accept you can adapt.  So what you are doing is you are not living in truth.  You are living in what I hope he would be what he has a potential to be but not where he actually is now.  When you accept where he is now, this is who he is, he wants to be.  The next question is, can you adapt to that meaning?  Are you okay with that?  Adapting to his lifestyle and staying with him?  That's the thing what she's trying to do is change him, make him fit, so that she can have what she wants.  Wrong.  She's trying to solve the wrong problem.  He's not changing.  This is it.  This is what you have got.  The question now is, I accept my problem.  I live in truth.  This is how my husband wants to be.  Can I adapt my lifestyle so that I can still stay with him?  Or is that a big of a deal breaker where I have to pull away?  She was asking the wrong question.  Because she's scared of the potential answer?  Or?  Because she's not seeing the truth in her problem.  Meaning this is who he is.  Fundamental.  Fundamental.  You have been trying for years to change him.  And you are trying to make your life better to the point where you are emotionally upset, like she was so upset about it.  And I said, but you are trying to solve something that you cannot solve.  This is a whole other person.  This iceberg, this bottom part.  He's not, he does not want it.  He's fixed.  What's happening is, this is called adaptability.  We want to adapt to our problems.  She's not adapting to her problem.  She's not accepting what her problem is.  The problem is, this is my husband.  This is who he is.  And this is who he wants to be.

But I might be worried that he's going to die or something.  He very well will.  And, you know, if you see someone that's about to die, one should intervene.

But can you intervene?  And does he want you to intervene?  He does not want her to intervene.  And so what matters to you most?  Do you want to keep doing this all day long?  Because that's what she's doing to the point where she's crying when I am coming off stage?  Or do you accept that?  I cannot change him.  I accept him as he is.

Now, am I willing to adapt to the truth of what my relationship is and stay married and be okay or not?  She's the one who needed to adapt.

But she could not adapt because she was not living in truth.  It's like, look at it this way, your partner's cheating on you, and you do not want to know.  You do not want to hear it.  Right.  And, but you are unhappy you are having all these issues.  Part of the reason you are having these issues is because your partner is not happy, right?

But the other thing you are unhappy with is this question, how can I get about you?  Are you unhappy with me or this person?  And how can I identify with him?  And how can I is because you cannot accept the truth the majority of people struggle 99.  9% of people are not adaptable because they do not live in truth what's the true problem you have accept it then decide okay now where do I go from here but people do not accept the truth it's how I wish it could be how I would like it to be how it was how it could be know what am I dealing with right now does not mean you have to like it and this is not agreement she does not have to agree with his lifestyle but it's accepting this is who he is now my choice is do I stay or do I go how how much of a pain is this for you so you think you should never try and change someone I think it's wrong to do that to people especially if they are showing you repeatedly I do not want you to do this leave me alone and you also to Steven whether you agree with people's lifestyle choices or not it is their life it is not yours and so I think that there's also something a bit arrogant when we think we are going to roll in and let me tell you how I should live my values and your values could be vastly different so who am I to impose how I think you should be who says I am right who says I am right I say I am right based on my own value system but I am vastly different how people see things and what they think is right or wrong it's not the same so I I accept people as they are and I respect them I may not want to hang out with them because it's just not the circle of people I want to be but I also it how narcissistic of is it of me to think I am going to roll in and change you it's kind of like I did interviews interrogations on terrorists and when I walked into an interview or interrogation I did it was delusional to think that I am going to walk in and I am going to tell this person hey I am I am part of the good guys I I just want you know to protect people and America you know we are really just trying to do the right thing this is a person his iceberg that was set for years he's thought a certain way he's he developed who he was 30 40 years old whatever it is this is who he is and I am going to roll in what and get you to change your whole mindset I knew who I had accepted who I had I did not try to change the narrative oh no I am this oh no I am that I did not do any of that but my goal was what am I trying to get to I was like well I need information on the next attack I need to know where the next weapons are coming in I need to thwart this so I need to get him talking and that's what I am looking for I am not trying to change his value system I would be there all day and all night weeks it would never work that's what we do we try to fundamentally change who people are I have people I care about very much in love and I have tried too there are times where you love somebody so deeply and you are like please especially if it's something that harms them but I have also learned they do not want it and the ironic is sometimes the more you try the angrier they become with you who are you right you are imposing yourself and your beliefs on somebody else and they are right who am I just because I think life should be lived this way it does not mean that they believe life should be lived this way they are probably thinking what's wrong nothing's wrong with this it's interesting when I was going through our previous conversations Evie and I was looking at the moments that people replayed the most or enjoyed the most or cut the most or sent to their friends the most the overarching thing I learned is that there's a lot of people out there who do not feel very strong they fit they do not feel seen they do not feel respected they themselves I think feel like they are low confidence and they look into a world full of other people who seem to be more confident and have everything figured out and they cannot relate and they feel at some level some of them a little bit unappreciated but I think the bigger point here is about confidence and strength and feeling like yes feeling feeling like I can I can get what I want from life okay we are going to break this down but I want to ask you a question if it's okay yes how do you build your confidence or what's something you do that builds your confidence oh that's a great question do you know what's really interesting when I was 20 years old I think I thought I was confident but I do not think I was and I only kind of figured this out in hindsight because this is a I do not think I have said this before but between the age of 18 and 20 every girl that I was interested in and would get some way down the line with would eventually reject me and then from about I know people go yes because you made a million dollars no listen it was not that even when I had the money I was still having I was still being rejected by women and then it was just like it was it was it was just like a physical thing you some point around like 25 to 30, everything changed.  And so I always say to my friends, I said to one of my friends the other day, I was like, I do not know why, I do not know the science of this, but what I do know is that it's very, very hard to fake confidence because I think it lives in a thousand micro expressions.  I was doing everything the book said, and I still was not getting the results in terms of a romantic context.  It was like these women could just like figure out at some deeper level that I was not it.  And I never knew what I was doing because I guess I cannot see myself.  Maybe I was texting back too fast.  That's kind of what you think.  Maybe the way I was standing.

But it taught me over time that actually you should aim at real confidence.  And the real confidence came when the story in my head about myself was that I was of high value.  And I will share a story.  So the reason I said this to my friend literally two weeks ago was because he was dating someone and she turned around to him.  She's a very young girl.  He's 30, five.  She was 25.  She turned around and said, you know what?  I do not think I want to have kids.  They would known each other four months.  And his response to that was like really, really insecure.  It was like, I really want to have kids.

I want to have kids.  And she ended up dumping him a week later.  And I remember I said to him, do you know, my current girlfriend said the same to me when I was 30.  She turned around to me and said, I am not sure if I want to have kids.  And in my head, the first thought that came in was, if I am being completely honest, was I am not sure I want to have kids with you yet either.  You are still a young girl.  I am not sure I want to have kids with you.  You are still on trial.  Like I am still dating you to figure out if you are the right person.  So my response, even though I did not say anything out loud, because I just kind of shoulder rolled it, was because I valued myself, my immediate response was not to be insecure.  It was to think, does not matter.  I am still trying to figure out if I want to have kids with you.  And I did not say anything.  I just carried on with my day.  And it made me think that like, yes, it's a thousand tiny things.  Confidence is a thousand tiny things, but it exists.  It like comes out of this central source of who you think you are.  And I think that's what I am trying to do.  And I think that's who I think you are.  And I think to answer your question, the reason why thing that gave me confidence in my life was I did some things that convinced myself that I was someone worth respecting.

I want to get to the confidence thing in a moment.  I am actually curious because you said something and I am wondering, do you think these women, like your girlfriend and his, the girl he was dating, do you think they genuinely meant it when they said it?  No.  My girlfriend's literally told me, I have been with her for seven years now, and we are, we are planning on having kids right now.  She was test.  She did not know she was.  Yes.  This is what I said to him on the fucking plane.  We were flying on a plane.  She did not know she was.  It was a test.  She did not know she was testing me though.  And when people hear it was a test, people will think it was a conscious thing that she would written down and she planned it.  No, she would been through a bunch of stuff with a bunch of guys who had taken away her freedom.  And so she was, her subconscious was testing whether I was one of those guys that was also going to try and restrict her or control her.  Her whole relationship, I was aware of this.  So when she, those moments where she said, you know, I think I might want to fly back to Bali.  I said, babe, at any time when you feel like you want to go back to Bali, you go and I will help you.  I will help you go back to Bali.  You do not have to be in London.  You go wherever makes you happy.  I would say it to her all the time.  I would say, you go wherever makes you happy.  And you know what?  I would mean it.  Because why would I want to be with someone that was not happy?  And this is ultimately what meant that she felt safe, secure, free, and then it flipped.

But that would never have happened if I was like my friend who, literally feels like he's up against a clock to find a woman and he needs to find one ASAP.  Because he's, he's actually 30, he's nearly 40 now and he's single.  He's like, Steve, you do not understand.  I do not have the time.  So he's trying to rush people down the aisle.  Yes.  So it's always when you said that and his circumstance, but you always wonder why would, and some people truly do not want to have kids and there's nothing wrong with it.

But I have found, because I have seen it too, when somebody says it, why are you saying it?  And do you genuinely mean it?  Or are you saying it to see the other person's reaction?  Are you saying it because you want to feel better?  Because I know some people who maybe did want or do want to have kids and they cannot, or they cannot find a good partner.  And so a way that they make peace with it too, is they say that.  And everybody makes peace with things, things their own way.  Or some have had past relationships where the other people, you know, their potential partners were turned off by, especially there's like this thing, and I do not know if it exists now, but where some guys may be turned off because they think women want a guy who just wants to have kids.  So I do not want to put off that vibe.  So I am going to say this to you.  So you do not think that I am, I am that way.  So that's why I always wonder when people say it, what are they really saying?  So in her case, her sisters have never been able to leave their hometown, her six sisters, because all of them had kids super young.  And he actually told me this a couple of months earlier, that she's a little bit uncomfortable.  She's a little bit uncomfortable.  She's a little bit unsure about the kids thing because she thinks her freedom.  So six months into their relationship, when she comes out with a statement like that, honestly, what I said to him, I was like, bro, like you are six months in, just let it ride to bloody hell.  Just carry on like whatever you were doing in that moment, just carry on doing it and say, that's interesting.  Keep it moving.  Cause you know, but, but going back to the point, because there's this internal insecurity in him, as much as you could coach someone like that, or they could read the books, et cetera, they are going to be tested in a thousand ways.  So he's, it's fear-based.  So he's, his decisions are being made because he's afraid he will not find someone.  So he's dealing with something.  It's not confidence he's dealing with.  He's insecure, but his, his decision is I need to find somebody now because I am afraid I will not find somebody, or I am afraid I will not get married, or I am afraid I will not have kids.  So everything is fear-based with him.  It's like when you make a decision, you know, I, I cannot quit my job because I am afraid I will not find another job.  I cannot leave this bad relationship because I am afraid I will not find somebody else.  Those are fear-based decisions.  So everything he's doing is pushed and promoted by fear.  So him dating, trying to find someone, it's not because he truly, does he want to find somebody?  Yes.

But the bigger drive is I am afraid I am not going to find somebody.  So I am trying so hard.  So all his decisions are fear-based.  So that's why his response were fear-based.  Being fear-based is not a great place to be.  We all visit it and it's okay to have, fear.  Fear is an emotion, but when it becomes your identity and it sticks around a lot, that means every decision you are made is, is throttled by fear.  And so his dating is throttled by the fear that I will not find somebody fast enough.  People can tell, cannot they?  You feel it.  You feel, you feel it.  You feel that energy, right?  And it does, does it repel people?  Yes.  So he had this very emotional reaction.  And what did she do?  She's like, I do not want any part of it.  She disappeared because his fear, which he could not control.  And that was more self-regulation on his part, not confidence.  Self-regulation, self-regulation is I control my emotions.  So he's felt something, he felt panic and he could not manage that.  He could not like his governor.  We all have a governor who manages our emotions.  His governor was out to lunch.  And so he completely released.  So self-regulation is your ability to regulate your emotions.  So even though you are panicking, you are afraid, you are angry, you are sad, there has to be a governor that says, I know you are there, keep it quiet.  That's how you regulate your emotions.  That's self-regulation.  So because he's so highly fear-based, he's very poor at the moment at self-regulating his emotions.  Can someone learn to be a better self-regulator of their emotions so that they do not ruin their life by reacting to things all the time?  I did.  I was very hotheaded grown up.  I was just like my father.  I am Greek.  I am New York.  I mean, it was, I just had nothing going for me.  I had to learn and I learned in the NYPD.  I was very young and I was very fortunate to be around very premier people.  We were talking about your hiring process before, how it's slow and drawn out.  That hiring process is very slow and drawn out.  They kind of, they pluck you because the idea is if we put you in here, you better fit well because just one person's going to muck up the whole thing.  We do not want, we want efficiency.  And so I, so with that, I was around very highly regulated people, highly intelligent people.  And so because I was around very highly regulated people and instructors who kept me in check, I clacked it in.  So that's how I was able to manage myself.  So who's around you?  If everybody around you is a loose screw.  Do you still have the amygdala like explosion?  They are like, do you still have the mental surge of emotion, but you just on the outside sort of have learned to keep it in?  Externally, I can do it very well.  Sometimes at home with my husband, who's also, he's also Homeland Security, special agent, U.  S.  Secret Service.  I, sometimes it's nice to put it down because it's hard to be on all the time.  It's hard to self-regulate all the time.  And so there's moments where he would be like, somebody's a little emotional right now.  And so I will check myself, but there are those safe people that once in a while you, I think it's important to have, but even with him, you know, you do not want to do that to people because then you make people your friends.  Someone came up to me actually the other day and talked about a previous conversation, which is somewhat linked to what we are talking about now.  They said, hi, Stevie, you had that incredible one on your podcast.  And she talked about how you should not bring your authentic self to work.  And she asked me about that.  And that's kind of what you are describing there, which is you are going to be a different person at home.  Do not bring your authentic self to work.  I do not want your authentic self to work.  I want your professional self.  I want your respectful self.  I want your empathetic self.  I want your competent self.  You can bring your authentic self to Thanksgiving meal with your family if you would like to.  Does that make sense?  You and Secret Service are like, come in, everybody be your authentic selves.  You do not get high performers.  You get sloppiness.  Everybody's doing their own thing.  That's not a team.  If you are team oriented, you leave your authentic self here and you bring your genuine self who genuinely cares about the mission, who genuinely cares to do a good job, who genuinely knows that it's not about you.  It's about your authentic team.  That's who you bring.  Your authentic self is about who?  Me, me, me, me, me.  I am all about me.  In teams, nobody cares about, I do not mean in a mean way, they do not care about you personally.  Who, what are you bringing?  Are you bringing value?  Are you bringing solutions?  Are you getting things done?  My authentic self.  Could you imagine if I brought my authentic New York self to every interrogation I did?  I would interview people who committed crimes against children.  In one case, three-year-old little girl, she says about the person who was babysitting her, which was a 16-year-old young man, young man.  He touched me down there.  Three-year-old little girl.  So they call me in to do this interview on this young man.  This little girl saying he touched her down there.  They are three.  They are not really able to communicate.  Can you talk to him?  So I am sitting talking to him this interview and I am trying to find out what happened.  Well, as I am talking to him, he starts to reveal more and more.  He did touch her down there and he did other things to her.  He confessed he had full-on sex with this little girl between the ages of three to four of her age.  He's 16.  Could you imagine if I brought my authentic self into that room?  What would my authentic self say?  What are you thinking?  How could you?  It's a three-year-old.  No, I brought my professional self.  Okay, tell me what happened.  Tell me more.  Non-judgment poker face.  You know why?  Because what I think my authentic self is irrelevant.  What mattered?  Confession.  Getting a confession so I can find out what happened so that investigators could figure out what to do so this little girl would not be victimized again.  That's what I mean by your authentic self.  Do not come in and be phony.  Nobody wants a phony.

But authentic self has become me, me, me, me, me.  Everybody check me out.  It's me, me, me.  I was irrelevant personally.  It was what I was contributing.  What was my goal?  My task?  That's what I mean by authentic self.  So when you show up to work, wherever you work, what are you bringing to bring value?  To the whole team.  Because your authentic self could be I am bringing my problems, I am bringing my opinions, I am bringing my judgments.  Honestly, nobody cares.  I have lots of different leaders across my different companies.  And when I look at the best leaders, one of the things they have in common is you do feel like they are being honest with you.  Are they bringing their full authentic self and all their baggage to work?  No, but you feel like you are dealing with the honest self.  And I think some of the worst leaders, the ones that really, really struggle, you can see that the team that they are leading just feel like maybe they are manipulating them a little bit, or they are not being straight with them, or there's something going on.  They are acting.  You can kind of feel it.  So I am wondering how this kind of sits with everything you have just said there, because you are going into these interrogations and you are winning them over to some degree because you are building trust.  You are building trust, but you are not acting.  That's a different thing.  I am not being disingenuous.  How do you square all of that?  Are you acting?  You are not acting?  I am listening.  Because I am not there for me.  And I am not there to pass judgment.  The quickest way to shut people down, even in business, you want to know what's going on around you all the time.  If people are too afraid to say things or do not tell Steven, oh, you do not know how he's going to react, or he's going to get mad, he's this.  That's a problem.  The problem is they are going to be too afraid to tell you things.  You want people to come to you and to give you the answer.  And that's what I am saying.  I am not being disingenuous.  I am not being disingenuous.  I am not going to give you the bad news to tell you when things are not going right, because you want to collect intelligence.  You are collecting intelligence because when you have the right intelligence, then you can make the right decisions.

But you must know what's going on around you.  So when you pass judgment and you are telling everybody your opinion, and you are bringing your authentic self, people filter information because they are bringing versions of themselves that they think you want to hear.  We do not want that.  I was very neutral.  I am a neutral slate.  Even to this day, I try to be neutral in that.  I allow people to come to me, and people are very open and they share, and it works well for me because I get a good read on people and situations so I can make good decisions.

But I do not do a lot of the talking.  A good interviewer does not say anything.  Good interviewer says less.  Do not make it about you.  Do not try to guess where people headspace is.  Ask them.  You seem like something I said before is upsetting to you.  Could you tell me a little bit about that?  Explain to me what it is that you are worried about right now.  Describe to me what you are concerned about.  We used to call it TED.  Tell me, explain, describe.  It's just a great way to get people talking.  Just get them talking.

But going back to what you are saying, it's just everything is very about me, me, me.  We have become so identity-based that we do not really—we are not connected to the community around us and how we impact others.  Everything is what's happening to me.  What's in it for me?  Me, me, me.  It's like, do you know that you impact other people?  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You tell them.  You touch other people.  You affect other people's lives.  You make other people's day better or worse.  You make the work environment easier or more taxing.  You do that.

But everything has become myself.  And we have lost that balance of the world does to me, but I also do to the world.  To be effective when you are dealing with these monstrous people that you dealt with, whether it's terrorists or people that hurt children or whoever else it might be, you are not going to be able to do that.  You are not going to be able to do that.  Did you have to kind of step outside of.  Do you have to detach at some deeper level?  And do you have to see everybody as just a human being?  Because I am wondering how you navigate these spaces when these people have done horrific things.  Did you teach yourself to just be more empathetic, dare I say?  You could be empathetic.  So all different crimes have different types of characteristics.  So somebody who's a terrorist, let's say, that's more of an ideology.  And they were typically raised from being very young to feel a certain way.  So I understood coming into a room that I am dealing with someone who's been groomed from a very young age to see the world a certain way.  So that's why I did not bother wasting my time trying to change that person's viewpoint.

But what about that kid that hurt that little girl?  So with him, that specific one, I spent a lot of time speaking to him.  And I did bring empathy.  So empathy does not mean I agree with you, I am trying to understand you.  And what turned out with him is that he had been sexually abused—himself—when he was young.  And so all that stuff came out.  And it did not excuse his behavior or what he did, but it was genuine.  I was genuinely curious.  I was genuinely asking him.  And at the same time, I needed to find out the truth.  Sometimes I would have somebody across from me, and I am thinking they did it.  And Then?  And afterward, I am like, they did not do it.  There's times where you clear people, and that's really important.  So that's why when you would, at least when you talk to people, and even to this day, we are all biased, but I try not to come in and project that.  I really try to give people a fair chance to show me what's happening instead of coming in with prejudgments.  And so you are better at reading their behavior too when you are talking to people.  So with him, he revealed a whole bunch.  What had happened to him, it was sad.  It was empathetic.  It did not clear him from what he did.  Eventually, actually, with the confession I got, he was eventually tried as an adult.  And that was very detrimental, obviously, to his life, right?  It impacted his life.

But I could have genuine empathy in that moment.  Empathy is like, I am just trying to understand where you are and how you feel.  That's not sympathy.  Who's better at spotting lies, women or men?  There's no research that shows.  One is better than the other.  Because women seem to have a sixth sense.  And people joke about it in relationship context.

But I genuinely feel like women have a heightened sensitivity.  And actually, when you look at some of the studies, for example, women can smell, I think it's testosterone, but men cannot smell the same or certain hormones on women.  So from a physiological standpoint, women do seem to be more sensitive, especially to men.  There's that study they did where they got T-shirts off men after they would been for a run.  And the women went down and smelt them.  And then I think they had to guess which one was the most attractive.  And they all pointed the one that had the highest testosterone in it.  So there's things that are going on that we cannot see and feel.  So I just wondered if your experience, men or women, were.  In my experience, no.  And I will say, this is just a lot of men were very good at assessing.  One of the reasons.  Look, the vast majority of.  Yes.  The polygraph examiners were male.  There were some women, and they were very good too.  The vast were male.

But males, men are good at being more rational.  It's actually, they were trying to figure out if there's a difference in the brain between men's brains and women's brains.  And there's not much.  The one thing that they saw is that women have more discernment.  So a female brain tends to activate a little bit more, and they tend to think about something more than the male brain.  A male brain may be a bit more impulsive.  Right?  More action-based.  And the female brain may be a bit more, let me talk to you, let me try to understand.  And actually, if you look at the data for female cops versus male cops, female cops have less complaints against them, made against them.  And they tend to think because they are better communicators.  They have less complaints.  Because when you are a cop, you are going to get a complaint.  There's no way.  You are going to get them like.  You are going to just get them.

But women tend to have less.  Female officers.  Female officers tend to have less complaints.  And they think that they are just better at dialoguing and de-escalating.  On this point about confidence, then, you said it did not sound like my friend had a confidence issue.  Do you think confidence is the thing that the people who do feel like they are not respected in the world need to be aiming at?  And in your experience, what can one do to build their confidence?

Let me say this first.  I have been around very steady people, confident people, I suppose.  I have never seen anyone.  Or heard anybody talk about it.  Ever.  I have never heard anybody in the circle of where I was, whether it's former SEALs, US Secret Service, the.  I have never had anyone talk about it.  And I think one of the secrets is they do not talk about it.  They do not think about it.  They do not give it that much life.  They just.  I just am.  I just are.  So I think that's one secret where people try to.  They think about it so much.  And I think it goes back to what we are saying initially.  Like, stop over analyzing.  Just be you.  Just do.

But now if you are looking at confident people with things that I noticed traits amongst confident people or steady people, they have a strong.  They have a good circle around them, meaning they are very aware and meticulous of who's around them and who they associate with.  Because if you are not.  If you are around insecure people, it bleeds on you.  Like, you are going to absorb what other people are.  And if you are the most confident person in the room, it's probably not a good thing.  It's not a good thing.  You want to be around people you learn from.  It cannot just be you are at the top and everybody's looking to you.  Your bathtub's going to crack, number one.  The other thing I learned about confidence, research shows people in law enforcement are perceived to be highly confident.  And one of the reasons they believe it is because they are decision makers.  You make decisions on the spot, everyday life and death decisions.  And there's nobody to turn around to be like, hey, can I ask you your opinion on this?  What do you think I should do with this guy wielding this knife?  Should I shoot?  Should I not?  Should I pull out the pepper spray?  I mean, what would you do in this moment?  You would be dead.  So when you are used to making decisions, whether right or wrong, but when you are used to making those decisions and believing in yourself and trusting in yourself that you are making the best decision you can with the information you have at that moment, that builds confidence.  Be a decision maker.  I think those are the two most important.  I think those are the two most important.  I think those are the two most important.  I think those are the two most important.  I think those are the two most important.  I think those are the two most important things, having awareness.  And honestly, just show up.  Just show up.  Do not worry about being confident.  Worry about simple things.  Show up on time.  I was reading this study about confidence and the victim mindset.  It was a study done by YouGov in 2025 in the United States.  And it said women rated themselves much higher on trustworthiness, honesty, and empathy.

But men rated themselves higher on self-awareness, sense of humor, and confidence.  And the gap between self-reported confidence between men and women was quite significant.  It's about 50% of men consider themselves confident, where it's only about 35% of women that consider themselves confident.  I will tell you this.  I have never heard anybody from the field of work I came from say, I feel like I am an imposter.  You know that whole imposter syndrome?  I have never heard that.  Again, I did not hear it till after I left the service.  It's wild.  Because all these things.  I had no awareness.  I had no awareness of them because they were never discussed in the circle that we were in.  So I also think sometimes when we sit and discuss these things to such extent that they actually start to plant seeds of doubt.  I am not saying we should not study and have self-awareness, but I think when we over-evaluate to such a degree, we never did that.  And you know, how do you build confidence in, I think about training.  Training, there was nobody cheering you on.  There was nobody like, hey, Paul Purse, good job.  Good job, girl.  Good job.  They were trying to get me sent home.  You had to fight.  You had to claw your way.  You had to claw your way to get that job and then prove that you should be there.  They did everything they could to wean you out, to kick you out.  And so I think when you are determined, like you stick.  You just stick it out.  And you are just, there was days where I am like, I do not know how I am going to get through today.  Or even runs.  We would do runs.  And one of the things they would do, just some mess with you.  They take you on a run for miles and miles.  And you never knew when it was going to end.  That's the worst.  At least if you know, hey, we are going to run from here to here.  It's going to be two miles, three miles, five miles, ten miles, whatever.  Tell me what I am looking at.

But they would not tell you.  So you would start running.  And then you would hit a point, like, and you would think, at least I would, I think, oh, my God, how am I going to do this?  And you know what I would do?  I would go and I would be like, just make it to that tree.  It was just five feet ahead of me.  I made it to the tree.  Make it to that mailbox.  I made it to the mailbox.  Just make it to the next tree.  And that's how you do it.  What's right in front of me?

But if you look at that whole picture of how am I going to be all of this, it's so overwhelming and so it's just so hard.  It's just going to kill your confidence, whether it's like I want to do this.  What's the first thing I need to do?  Then the second thing.  I would think, and I am asking you this.  I am asking you when you build your businesses, right, or your company, did you just put one foot in front of the other and just try to do it?  Or did you stop and say, you know what, Steven, let's have a conversation.  I need to be confident before I do this.  I need to build my confidence.  Did you sit and do that?  And once you checked off that confidence bit, then you are like, okay, now I am ready to do this.  Yes, one of the most incredible things is I actually did not know what the word entrepreneur was.  I had no idea what it was.  So I had this idea.  And I started trying to figure out how to make the idea work.  I started trying to figure out how to make the idea happen, which looked like three months on Google scrolling down, searching the word web developer, clicking onto people's links, and then emailing them saying, hey, can you build websites?  So it was this long, drawn-out process of stumbling forward.  And had I known, I think a lot of entrepreneurs and founders say this, had I known what it would have taken, had I known how difficult it was, had I not been so ignorant and naive, maybe I would have been demotivated or demoralized to do it.

But I was 18, left university, had an idea, did not know what the word entrepreneur was.  I did not know how you established a company and tried to use the internet to make that idea happen.  Like three to four months trying to figure out how you name a company just by like Googling stuff.  So very much one foot in front of the other.  What did you just say?  I was ignorant and naive.  Yes, it was useful.  It was phenomenally useful.  Because I think if I was informed, it would have been like standing at the foot of Mount Everest.

But I could not see the mountain in front of me.  So it felt much more easy to climb.  And this is in part why people get, you know, I spoke to Nir Eyal, who's an author of a book called, Undistractable.  And he said a phrase to me, which I have always remembered.  He said, procrastination is the avoidance of psychological discomfort.  So when you have that big essay to do, what you end up doing is taking the path of least resistance, which might be, I will just clean the house.  And the house gets really tidy.  Because psychologically, that essay feels like Mount Everest.  You do not know where to start.  You are not well researched on it.  So you clean the house instead.  And so procrastination is in part, the avoidance of psychological discomfort.  And so had I known how big that mountain was when I was 18, I probably would not have done it because the psychological discomfort associated with the knowledge would have been so overwhelming.  I would have just cleaned my house.  And so sometimes, yes, it does help.  It goes back to a lot of the stuff that we are saying that sometimes over analyzing and trying to make sense of things does you a disservice.  Where sometimes if you just let things be and you just move forward to try to execute, the goal is to execute and do.  Because if you sit and try to analyze everything, how should this be done or that be done?  Or if you look at the bigger picture of what it's going to be like, it can kill you.  It can kill your confidence.  Training, I had no idea what training was going to be like.  Absolutely none.  I went in there completely blind, completely clueless.  I actually thought it was going to be like college.  Ha ha.  I learned my lesson the hard way.

But this, I think we need to be a bit more present and focused and just start executing on it.  Executing and making progress.  Progress no matter how small is progress.  As long as you are moving in that direction.

But thinking about something, ruminating over something, playing that CD over and over again, procrastinating, just start.  Just go.  I spoke to Sir David Brailsford, who's the guy that turned the British cycling team around.  And he told me that when he went in there and those players, those cyclists were like down and out and depressed and winning nothing, one of the first things he did was ban them from thinking about the podium.  And so I always, I came up with this phrase called pedals over podium, based on everything he said to me, which is he got his riders to think about the pedals in front of him, just the rotation of the pedals and not whether they were cycling fast enough to win the gold or needed to speed up.  And he said to me when he did that, it was almost like the riders would get to the end of the track and they would get off the bike and they could not recall the cycle because they were so present.  They would almost been in like this hypnotic state, but they ended up producing their best times because what they would done is they removed the amygdala, all the emotion, the fear, the, you know, which burns a lot of energy as a cyclist.  I imagine if you are thinking too much and that produced their best times, they went on to become the most successful cycling team of all time, I believe, and won five out of the six Tour de France's.  And that whole idea of like, yes, just be present, just focus on the next, as you say, step along the way.  I think it's difficult for people because sometimes that first step is so small, so small that it's sometimes a little bit embarrassing.  You know, the first step to change your life, the first step to confront an issue in your life is sometimes so small that it's not easy.  It feels like that cannot possibly be the right step to take.  Because it's hard.  Because it's uncomfortable.  What's that like, they call it exposure therapy.  It was Jordan Peterson that said to me, he was like dealing with a guy in there who would not leave his bedroom.  And instead of getting him to like go outside and stuff, he just got him to move the hoover 10 centimeters closer today.  And that was today done.  And then the next day he got him to like turn the hoover on, but then turn it off.  That was that day done.  And Jordan said to me, he said, how can you be so shy and be so shy when it's so small?  So I think one of the things that people say to people who change is the first step is often so embarrassingly and shamefully small that people like do not want to do it.  That's like embarrassing to do something so small.  Because it's a myth.  We have been fed a myth that to make big change in your life, you have to make do big decisions.  You have to make big movement.  And the big change you create in life, it's through the small movement.  You just reminded me of a story, my buddy, Don Saladino.  He's like he does training all those characters he trains a lot of them to get them physically fit for the movies and he was telling me he had a story of a i think he was telling me he had a client and who he was just trying to get him to work out and the client was overweight and having all these issues so what the client did what they did is the client just tried to create progress so the first day what he did was he took his sneakers and he just put them in front of his bed and that was it and then the next day he took his shoes and put them outside the door of his bedroom and then the day after that he took the shoes and put them in the kitchen and then the next day he took the shoes and just put them on and then the day after that he took the shoes he walked outside and put them on outside then the day after that he took the shoes and just went to the corner and then came back and then he went from being severely obese and having being very unhealthy to running marathons and that's how he did it you have seen some of the most consequential people ever make decisions these presidents maybe you cannot answer this question i do not know if you can but who were the best decision makers and why that you observed i am going to say this to be the president of united states it's no small thing so for you to get to that place you you are exceptional i just i say this in a neutral way people get very personal or biased and i do not just because i served under various presidencies did not matter what the party was and i learned so much from all of them but as far as making decisions there are a couple of things one they had a really good circle around them inner circle like everybody did not have access to the president there were layers around the president so everybody did not have access to them that was really important but the circle around them was a circle that was there to support them everybody was there to support them everybody was there to support them everybody was there to support them around them was steady i never saw i never saw anybody go cry at the white house i never saw anybody lose their mind i never saw anybody get emotionally dysregulated i never saw this and that was important because that kept them steady the other thing was they were very good at delegating so they did not need to know everything but they would find people who knew more than they did to give them advisement to help make decisions and they would just make decisions the other thing i saw and i witnessed they worked very hard they worked i would see presidents sit up i mean i think it's okay to say this i really do not talk about the people i protected out of out of respect you know there's a greek saying everybody loves the everybody loves the treason nobody loves a traitor and so i am just always careful not to say but i would see presidents like i remember president bill clinton he would be up till very late hours of the night studying reading preparing just reading better than barack obama i mean i would work midnight shifts sometimes and he was up studying sitting at his desk reading preparing they would study they would spend time studying so all those things collectively help you feel like i am as informed as i can be by studying myself by surrounding myself with people who are informing me who are also steady and then i make the best decisions i can with the mom the information i have in front of me now one of the things we do and we all do this we do a disservice to us when things do not go or work out the way we thought they would we beat up on ourselves i should have known this i should have this i should have that and anytime i start to do that or i have somebody and i always say i am like my husband used to say this too he's like you made the best decision you could with what you knew in that moment do not go back and make yourself feel like because you feel you should have chose differently i have heard obama say that so just like i said it pretty much close he i i heard him talk about this whole idea of a making decisions at 51 certainty when he spoke at this conference i was speaking at in sao paulo a couple years ago and he's talking about the big decisions in his career like going in and getting osama bin laden did not have 100 certainty and he said sometimes in life you have to make make a decision with the information you have and be at peace with the fact that you made the best available decision with the information you had and move move on confident people are okay with not knowing all the information yes they are okay i do not need to know it does not have to be 100 right because and here's the other thing because we are so scared of making the wrong decision and unless you are the president of the united states or and you are in law enforcement and you may shoot the wrong human being which i get but overall most decisions not life or death make a decision and then feel okay with it being wrong if you are so insecure that you are terrified you are going to make the wrong decision why because you are going to look dumb you are going to feel dumb confidence you do not care how you look or how you eat you are not sick and you are not quantifying he's going to think i am done she's going to think i look stupid they are going to think this and even for yourself like you do not tally that you are okay with making the wrong decision it's like i am going to make my choice i hope it's the right one i did the best i could but i am comfortable with that but if you are so worried about it's the wrong decision then do not make one and that's that in and of itself that the confident people do not do that so the other thing i would see presidents do they they had time to themselves meaning like you would see them they would have time where they would be alone and they would think they will not they were not always exposed or surrounded by people george w bush he would go to waco to the ranch that was his roots that was his place to like i need to kind of find my roots person barack obama i spent every holiday in hawaii he went home george bush senior he would split his time between kenny bunkport and texas houston so that was another thing they would all go home they would all go home i hear from a lot of very successful people that i interview that they all have some kind of meditation practice and even when i looked at the life of someone like steve jobs and how he was able to continually see round corners and remove the keyboard and remove the stylus then remove the iphone jack and remove java from our phones and do all of these things that the time were like crazy talk that that's someone who was motivated to do something that was not his own and that's why he was able to do it and he was able to do it because he was motivated by money today would not have done but someone that could see the future tomorrow could have done and you come to learn that he was basically like a yogic like he was he was a meditator and what you described there made me think of that which is okay all these successful people seem to be have some kind of practice where they get out of the trenches and like into their intuition or into the clouds alone so they have space to stand back from the painting so they can see the full picture do you know what they were all also do.  I cannot speak for all of them, but a lot of them worked out.  Like their workout was built into their schedule.  President George Bush Jr.  , he would bike.  He used to actually be a runner.  He was a very fast runner because they would ask for agents to run with them.  And when you run, when you would run, you have to run with your gear on.  President Clinton was a runner.  Then Bush, Bush started biking.  So you had to be a good biker.  Where can they run?  Well, President Bush would run the trails when we would go to Texas or Waco.  You are not going to run the streets of Washington, D.  C.  So they have, the White House has its own internal gym, but they did, they did run.  They were very athletic.  President Barack Obama, every morning, gym.  So the part of integrating the body into the mind is key.  I saw them all do it.  And I think that plays a role.  It cannot just be, we separate the mind from the body.  We separate the mind from the body.  We separate the mind from the body.  We separate the mind from the body.  We separate the mind from the mind.  When you physically take, I have just seen them all do it.  And I learned it also as an agent, like you are, you had to work out and you had to use your body because also when you use your body and you are moving it and you are, you are working it out, you are taking care of it.  You feel good.  You feel like you are doing something powerful and positive for yourself.  And that in and of itself builds confidence and strength.  Just give me a minute.  Give me a minute of your time.  And I will tell you about a device that my team has been using that they will not seem to shut up about.  It's called the Note Pro and it's by our sponsor, Plord.  This tiny card clips onto the back of your phone and captures everything.

But why it's so clever is that it picks up multiple voices at the same time.  And when someone says something important, you just push this tiny little button here.  And that moment gets highlighted in your notes and captured.  It records the conversations that it hears.  Takes those conversations, creates a transcript, and it uses AI to synthesize all of that information into whatever template suits you.  You get a summary, action points, highlights, and even a mind map sent straight to the Plord app.  So I highly recommend you check out Plord's products using the link in the description below.  Do not tell anybody this, but if you use code DOAC22, you will get 22% off on some of Plord's products.  I was trying to understand.  What it feels like to have a true lack of confidence.  How does it feel inside your body?  And the research I did showed there's really four areas that you feel it.  The first area is in your body physically, like the tightness in your body, which could be clenched jaw.  It could be like that fidgeting you see, heart racing, all the fight or flight responses.  The second way you feel it is in the mind, self-doubt, asking yourself always, am I good enough?  Kind of double guessing yourself, running through worst case scenarios, ruminating on your past mistakes.  The third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you are in a situation where you are feeling like you are not doing well.  And then the third way is in your emotions, which is the way you feel when you are feeling like you are not doing well.  And then the fourth way is in your emotions, which is this feeling, this insecurity that you might be exposed at some point, avoiding speaking out too much or holding yourself back.  And the last way is in behavior, which is speaking softly, rushing your words, avoiding eye contact and apologizing too much.  I feel that's such a waste of time.  Like to spend, to sit and analyze yourself.

Now, if you are not a good speaker, I look at it as I want to work on my speech.  It's paralinguistics it's called, right?

I want to try for my, the best tone I can so that I can speak with authority.  Research shows that it's not what you say.  People sometimes sit and memorize like what they are going to say, the words they are going to use.  When in fact the research shows what you, how you say it impacts people more than what you say.  So the way that you speak is clearly resonant with people.  Are you aware of what it is about the way you speak that is making my viewers show up?  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  I am not sure.  Every time you come here in the tens of millions to hear you speak.  When I speak, I own my voice.  So there's paralinguistics there.  And I learned this from doing the news, because if I do not sound like I know what I am talking about, then does not matter what I say.  It's what I sound like.  So if, you know, even using the, I will use the word I just said, I cannot do a good job of speaking, especially when I do not know what I am saying.  I cannot do a good job of speaking.  I cannot do a good job of speaking.  I cannot do a good job of speaking.  I cannot do a good job of speaking.  I cannot do a good job of speaking.

But if you are out there, go and speak in that way.  And please, if you have a good voice, be sure to speak with a high pitched voice.

I want to have a high pitched voice.

I want to be able to speak in a high pitched tone, which in turn is part of my voice, my deeper tone, give her that high-pitched voice which does not mean it's her natural voice it's the voice that I have helped cultivate and groom for her to have so let's just put that right there so those are little things that I also have awareness of I do not want to tell her hey speak speak this way I am going to show her to speak and she's going to she's going to mimic that so when you look at how you present yourself to others so as far as like when I come here I come here and I look at it this way this interview is not about me you have invited me here what third time thank you I am super humbled but this is not about me it is about them the audience right I do not matter I am irrelevant you are irrelevant we are two people who are trying to share information that maybe hopefully make the world a better more wise more just place maybe it helps makes people's lives a little bit better that's what matters they matter we do not and so when you bring that in and you put all your energy on the person you are speaking to because they want to hear it and if you put that there then they feel it as you said all of that I was analyzing the way that you were speaking and you do a bunch of really interesting things one of them is that you take silences that most people would not take okay I am going to do not be offended I am going to try I am not okay I am going to try and show what I mean are you there for you or are you there for them most people would not have taken that silence there's a certain selfish because silence is taking something from some someone in an interesting way it's like you have taken some time from someone and people you know as it says in these studies that are low confidence they rush because they know that I do not want to waste your time I am not that important so let me hurry through this yes so I do not I do not cuz you cuz you are more important than I am a hundred percent right so you I will give kudos to this I watch president speak Barack Obama again this is something I shared publicly and I think it's okay he was brilliant at this he would watch his speeches he would speak and he would take his time and he would take his time he would do an emergency you know how they would interrupt TV shows or something emergency you know message or breaking news from the White House whatever I never saw him rush to anything I never saw him you know say to himself or think I better hurry up through this you know I am just fraught in Grey's Anatomy people want to get back to the show no I am the President of the United States I have something relevant to say and I am going to say it I am going to own my time in my voice I am not going to waste your time I am going to get to the point I am not going to be labor the point that's difference I am here to stay now.

But I am get to the point and I am going to pause.  I am going to own my time.  So when you speak again, this is, it's how you say it, not what you say.  You also want to give people time to absorb what you are saying, to feel what you are saying.  When you slow down also as a presenter, I am less likely to make mistakes.  I am less slightly, less likely to say the wrong thing live on camera.  When I do the news, I am less likely to do these things.  And I am more likely to able to think process and share.  And you are right.  How many times do people do presentations?  And when I do communication for companies, I always tell them when you are doing your presentations, please do not do this.  All right, guys, just one other thing.

Let me put this in here.  I do not want to waste anybody's more time or take up any more time.  Just really quickly.  What did I just do?  I just told you what I am about to tell you really is not that important.  So do not even listen.  Why do we do that?  I am here.  I am speaking.  What I have to say, if I am saying something of value, if I know I am saying something of value, because I am trying to share and make the whole system, the process better, then pause.  I am going to pause.  I am going to speak.  I am going to share.

But if I am talking for myself, because I am insecure, I want people to see me.  Everybody needs to know you are sitting at that table, right?  Make yourself known.  Make sure they can hear you.  Make sure they see you at that meeting.  You just made that about you.  You should not be at that table.  That's the difference.  Command your voice.  Also, science and research, because I know you like science and research, the more we speak, meaning if we talk a lot and we use a lot of words and we do not get to the point, we are seen as less trustworthy.  And people will assess how competent and confident you are in the way you speak.  Get to the point.  Say it with less words.  And be impactful.  Command what you say.  So I think what we are trying to say is, I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  Command what I say.  I command what I say.  I command what I say.  I am not as worried in my head.  Am I wrong?  Am I right?  Am I going to say the wrong thing from time to time?  Sure.  Who is not?

But I am owning my voice.  And I think people are so afraid to own their voice.  Own your voice.  And if you are wrong, if your intention is right, and you have prepared, and you are doing your best, and you are being genuine, not authentic, you are being genuine, and you genuinely care about the people you are speaking to, the audience, then it's all okay.  Okay.  You use your hands a lot as well, which is, I think is a trait of someone who is, feels like they deserve your attention and space and respect, because it takes up room to, and as you were doing that, you were using a good, you know, 50 centimeters either side of you to make the point, but it's also just more engaging to watch because you went, and most people would not, a lot of people, you know, it's kind of like, it's.  So there's a couple of things, so it's really good that you brought that up.  One, I am Greek, so that plays a role.  So I try not to be, so they are called illustrators when people use their hands, but yes, there is a strategy to it.  One, I learned it from what doing television.  When I first began doing the news, which I knew nothing about, again, I went from a job where you were supposed to be not in front of the camera, actually out of the camera, because the camera is supposed to catch the president, never you, to being in front of the camera.  And the producer I worked with the very first day said, let me give you a secret.  When you are on camera, just so you know, the camera sucks like 25% of your energy away.  It takes immediately 25% of your energy out.  So when the person is watching, you look flatter.  You ever watch Zooms?  You ever do a Zoom and it looks like everybody's bored out of their mind and you are thinking, what's going on?  It's not them, it's the camera.  It takes energy.  So if you are trying to engage people, one of the things you can do, first of all, when you speak, people hear 49% of what you say.  So if you are trying to engage people, one of the things you can do, first of all, when you speak, people hear 49% of what you say.  So when you are talking, if you are able to keep their attention, they are hearing half of what you say.  And that's if they are connected to you.  So think about that.  Now I am trying to speak.  And when you speak, you are also telling a story.  So I can sit like this, which side note, when you sit on your hands, it's considered, some people say it's a considered sign of deceit.  I am hiding my hands.  I am a liar.  So when you, people do not see hands, it's a sign of untrustworthiness.  It's a sign of untrustworthiness.  Like you cannot trust them.  When you see hands, open hands, I am no threat.  It's kind of like a psychological thing for prehistoric times.  I see no weapons in your hand, I can trust you.  So that's something I learned as a technique as well in the polygraph room.  Always have your hands out, always be open.  I am open, I am here for you.  And so I have learned to roll that into how I present because I learned it's really important to use your hands and you are storytelling.  You are commanding your voice.  So all those things combined, you are trying to keep also people's attention.  So I also look at it, I am trying to keep you engaged in the conversations.  So I cannot be lazy and I have to work hard to keep you engaged.  Also people kind of like, they ping pong.  Even if somebody, you ever go to a conference and you are like, I am really going to pay attention.  I am going to really focus.  And five, 10 minutes you are in there and you lose people.  It's not their fault.  What am I going to eat later?  Where am I going to go for lunch?  Did I send that email?  Oh, I have to pick up my dry cleaning later.  People ping pong.  So it's especially today where you are competing with all this noise and there's so much noise out there.  You really are trying hard to keep people engaged.  So you do not have to be long-winded.  Speak, engage, show them that you are there, own your space and command your words.  One of the things I learned from watching MrBeast make content, but also from doing this podcast and sitting with guests that get really high retention.  Cause like the audience do not know this, but when every guest comes on the show, we get a graph back from YouTube and the other places that the podcast appears that shows how many minutes people listened for.  And sometimes there's like big swings.  Between the lowest performing guest and the highest performing guests on YouTube, there's a 100% gain in retention.  So like thinking back over the last month, the lowest performing guests on the Diary of a CEO in terms of how long people listened for is let's say, just get arbitrary number.  People listened for one hour.  The highest performing, they listened for two hours.  And that's the range that we see.  And when I look at why that is, it's often because it's why it's always because of the way that they speak.  You are one of the people that has extremely high retention because of the way that you speak.  And Morgan Housel is another one.  And I was watching Morgan Housel, the way he delivers his message.  And he basically always starts it with a curiosity gap or a promise.  And MrBeast does the same.  MrBeast's videos do not start with, hey, hi, I am MrBeast.  I am MrBeast.  Welcome back to my channel.  He immediately shouts a promise in your face, which is like, I have put a thousand people in that circle.  The last one to leave wins $5 million.  And immediately there's this curiosity gap.  Like I want to see the answer.  And I just noticed that in great speakers, even on stage when I go to conferences, is they leave me hanging on something that they have not yet given me.  Somebody once, when I began doing keynotes or speaking, there was this other speaker and he said to me, he's like, let me give you some advice, kid.  And I was like, sure, I will take it.  I did not mind.  And he had not heard me speak yet.  It was just, he was just trying to impart wisdom.  He said, just because you are an expert does not mean you are interesting.  And it always stuck with me.  Because there's people, Steven, that are probably smarter than I am, have more years or time experience in the US Secret Service than I do.  There's always somebody that's better, smarter, faster, whatever.

But a big part of what plays a role is how you present and how are you sharing that information and are you doing an effective job?  It's not about, let me tell you how smart I think I am.  It's about being able to relay that information in a way that people can understand and that's digestible.  It's how they process information.  Do you know, I even learned to do that in the interview room when I would Mirandize people.  I was trying to assess where they were linguistically.  And so I could speak to them in a way that resonated with them.  So one of the things I would do is I had Miranda.  I never read Miranda.  I never read Miranda verbally.  The Miranda rights in the United States before you interview anybody.  And I would do this, whether they were an applicant, a suspect, a victim, because you never knew how things were going to go.  I would Mirandize everybody.  You know, you have the right to remain silent, all that.  So I had a piece of paper and I would hand it to them and I would say, please read each sentence out loud.  So the first sentence would be, and I would have them hold it.  They would read out loud, I have the right to remain silent.  And I would ask them, do you understand that?  I would not read it.  I would say it.  I would listen to them.  And I wanted to hear their speech, how they, you know, like how, how it resonated, their language skills.  And they would sign it.  Then we would finish it.  And then I would ask them questions that I already knew the answer to.  What's your name?  What's your date of birth?  Where are you from?  I had all of this.  I did not need it, but it was a way for me to assess their speech.  And then based on that, I would meet them where they were.  I am not going to speak the way I normally speak.  I am going to adapt my speech.  There's adaptability in a way that's going to resonate with you the most.  So using big, hefty words, speaking super fast, especially I am from New York.  Like I said, I would go to the South.  They speak slower.  I would have to slow down so I could meet them where they were.  So I could speak to them in a way that resonated with them.  It's the listener that matters.  I am irrelevant.  We do not matter.  They matter.  Where is that person I am going to meet you there?  Also, even when you write, one of the things I learned in journalism school, New York Times writes at an eighth grade level to keep it simple so that people can actually finish the article or even a book, my book.  Do you know how hard it was to write the book?  Not for the content, but to write it in a way that was easy for people to read, not for people to read a chapter and be like, I need a nap.  Because it's too cognitive heavy.  You want to do things that people can absorb and they do not have to use all their, you know, use all their, all their brain power.  If it's too hard, if we speak too smart or too complicated, people get tired.  So the delivery mechanism in which you give information really matters.  You are talking so that they can understand, so that it's not hard for them to follow you, so that they can follow you easily.  They can stay connected with you and they are not needing a nap after you are done.  You speak for them, not for you.  A lot of people, especially I think podcasters, sometimes like to use bigger words because it makes you sound smarter.  The research shows that actually people see you as less competent.  When you use simpler words and you get to the point and you use less words in the vocabulary, it actually shows that you are deemed as more competent, more confident, and more trustworthy.  I realized this a couple of years ago when I was running my New York office for my old company.  And there was this young lady in the team, who I will call, I need to, Sarah, I will call her Sarah.  And Sarah in meetings would, when we were doing like creative brainstorms for clients, we had Uber as a client.  I remember being sat in the Uber brainstorm.  She would kind of think out loud.  And so she would say, what about if we did, I do not know, maybe we could do something like, maybe we could do like a pop-up and then we could, and she was thinking out loud.  And then there was this other guy who I can name called Cahill, Catty, he's a friend of mine still to this day.  And he would never speak, but the minute he started speaking, it was like, the room fell down.  The room fell silent.  Because he spoke so infrequently, we all knew that he was taking the time to think about what he was saying.  And what he was saying was about to be really, really valuable.  And I would witness with Sarah, people literally cut her off.  They would, even before she had said a word, like the first two words out of her mouth, they would immediately assume that it was not worth paying attention to, because she had developed what I would later call a bad contribution score, which is kind of like your credit score, but you hurt it when you contribute beyond value, if that makes sense.  Yes, but she's not, you notice she's so engrossed and it's not to make, to throw judgment at her, but that's what happens when you are so engrossed in what you are thinking that you lose sight of, there's 10 other people in this room.  And this is when, if you are going to open your mouth, use your pauses, use your silences, so that you can make sure your message is impactful and you are not running through, you are not vomiting everything out, which also makes you look nervous and lacking confidence.

But if you are going to speak, then command what you say, speak with conviction and do not waste people's time.  You can think of people in your life, right?  If you think about all the people you work with, there's ones that over-talk and there's ones that definitely under-talk, and then there's ones that like hit the balance just right.  And what is the, can you like tell me about these people and how, and if that's even true, what I just said?  It is true.  I think it depends who it is.  If it's someone I am working with, I am always kind of like, can we just, you know, in my head, I am like, land the plane, land the plane.  Like, I just, I do not, I have to have like 10 more conversations like these.  It's not to be mean, you know, but as you go higher up, or as you are doing more, you have less empathy, ironically.  It's not because you become meaner, it's just, I do not have the ability and I am going to, whether I am going to get there or not, I just feel like as I start working with them more, that that's actually okay.  And it's not because they are easy to feel about.  I think their personality is life, but I do not think they can, it looks like that's not an easy step.  And that was a question you did yesterday, where you were trying to answer that question.  One of my feelings to you is that, even if you feel more invested, and even though you had already started working with them, you are still going to keep working with them.  And I do not, particularly when I think about it as an dansé way of creating esos pieces, process, their orientation towards why they are here will be too much about Steve, too much about me.  And it will be highlighted when they meet my executives, my team, my chief of staff, my CEOs, whatever.  They will say, they will always come to me and say, I think this one's a little bit too interested in you and not the role.  And so when I get to meet this person, I will ask them a very simple question, which is explain to me exactly why this job appealed to you.  And they should be, and in that moment, all their answers should be about the work at hand, not I read your book and I thought, loved your podcast.  It should never be that because as you know, from working with very interesting people, that stuff will fade.  And when we go into the trenches, it will not matter whether you liked my book.  We are here to do work and you have to love the work.  The work has to be the thing you are thinking about in the shower, not my podcast.  And if that's the case, then you will be fine here.  What are the things that you think about when you are in a position where you are like, I did the hiring for the US Secret Service.  I did the polygraphs.  And I know you cannot polygraph people, but they would, we would polygraph people.  So I was like the last line of defense.  They would go through the whole hiring process, right?  Interviews, panel interviews, exams, there's, you know, tests you would have to take.  Anyway, so you pass all this stuff, right?  And then you get to me.  And so I was kind of the last line of defense.  And one of the things I would ask them during the interview, I would ask them, I kind of like what you said, why do you want to be a US Secret Service special agent?  And I typically get two types of answers.  Oh, I think it would be really interesting challenge.

I want to see if I can do it.  You know, it would be really, you know, I want to see what, you know, if I am able to do it.  And then the other answer I would get typically would be, you know, I want to serve my country.

I want to help protect people.

I want to do something bigger than me.  Do you know who made it through the hiring process?  These guys.  These guys who are I, me, I want to learn, I want to challenge, I want to see I can do it because they were so self-focused.  They, they, they, not only were they not making through the hiring process, they want to make it through training because these guys were focused on the bigger thing, the role.  And then these guys were focused on themselves, what they could get out of it.  So when people are interviewing with you, what can they get out of it?  I get to be around Steven.  Me, me, me.  There it is.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Oh, yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  So wild and wild.  Look i remember thinking bro you are so like if that's what you you care about you are you are going to struggle and people care too much about how it looks how they look how the job makes them look how the situation makes them look yes yes although i will say to my husband sometimes i am like you are lucky you are hot when we fight you are lucky you are a good-looking hot man because i do not know if we would have survived so there's moments stephen truth be told i am looking i am like you are lucky you are a good-looking man otherwise i do not know so the there's moments where that will save the relationship but i digress i forgot what you asked because i took you in a different direction because i was really just curious to see you know because i would see it with like high presidents and i would see with certain people and i experience it myself too sometimes you get this yes and i would think you would get it a lot and that's a really tough thing i would think i would say though some people that have been extremely successful in my company they were also big followers of the show i am thinking of you christiana christianus who is our chief revenue officer she told me she's listened to every episode ever actually in her application she used in the subject line like chapter 19 of my book and then in the email there were several things that i would written in my books she's an unbelievable performer because actually her career and her life and her passion is also the work so it can be both but it cannot be different and i think that's the thing that's really important to me is that you are not just like a person who's like i am going to do this and do this and do this and do this and do this and it cannot just be oh i just want to see what the challenge is like it you know what i mean it cannot just be a surface level any is there anything else that that is really pertinent on the point of you know that guy backstage that said to you that gave you that advice which was kind of a little bit patronizing it sounded like that you said it was not but it kind of it did not take it like that but i am also i also do not get easily offended to me i looked at it like like you have to really say that you are not going to be offended so i think i think my offensive levelness is probably my tolerance is higher than others is that a good thing yes because in the job that i came from you could not get you just could not get impacted with people as easy like you have to think of it this way like it would be something stupid steven like i probably here in new york once president barack obama he went out to dinner and i had to tell somebody standing by the restaurant ma'am you know sir could you please just cross the street and stand there because we had to clear the area and people lose their minds you are violating my rights phones come out they are yelling at you in your face now the new york me or the the evy me wants to just like punch him in the throat go across the street like i do not i do not have time for this she cannot do that so when you you have a job where people dislike you because you are law enforcement and they are in your face and when you are telling them to do something they automatically you have something called reactance nobody likes to be told anything nobody likes to feel like they do not have control over their alliance you their life so they have reactants which means immediately they are going to push back a really good example is covid people losing their minds you know when they were forced to wear masks and a big reason it was not really the mask it was that they felt that they had no autonomy you are telling me what i have to do and i feel like i have no control so in law enforcement you are typically dealing with this often where you cannot offer people a choice typically it's i need you to do this so when you have people really escalating and getting in your face and in many situations wanting an altercation they want to put on you you want to put on youtube you want to put on social media you have to manage yourself also my mind i am like you are not going to get that from me so you do have a higher threshold to tolerate a lot more nonsense so if i was someone who was really disrespecting you when you were doing your job and i was shouting in your face you told me to get across the street and i started cussing you out and being very personal and trying to sort of exacerbate the situation what would be going through your head at that exact moment i am now screaming in your face i have got my phone out i am telling you you are live on instagram what's what is actually going through your head versus what you are displaying externally what i would say is ma'am or sir whoever it was was like i appreciate you frustrated however i am not able to have you stand here could you please go across the street what's going on up here how many times i am going to say this before i force this person across the street before i put handcuffs on them that's what's happening in my head so in my head i am doing mathematical equation how many chances do i give this person before i throw on handcuffs have you ever had someone insult you yes in a really vicious just like horrible way it's dummy barbie you know and does it offend in inside even if you do not show it i do not want to say you get used to it but in a reality of everything you want to do there's going to be a Yong sweaty and that »a little divide like it supposed to incredibly but a' i mean that that's what i thought at the time i do not know what's going on i do not know about what's going on but yes no one i die and i i do not know what's going to happen when i am going to be behind thePaul saying it a little he says calling you dead private life to go into tertiary sure you are trying to force someone to leave panel that's no problem look i want to say want to make me go out and i want to just you know retentively sorry for this case in the end so i will just leave you there we are so sorry i will leave here for you to you they are committing crimes like you really could lose a lot of faith you really could become really cynical it's actually a common trait in law enforcement you have to be really careful to not become overly cynical because you are seeing the worst of people and they are also bringing out their worst behavior for whatever reason people are not their best the best version of themselves and again you are also typically not dealing with the good citizen you are dealing with people who are consistently com committing crimes if you look at crime in general the vast majority of crime it's committed by the same group of people and the majority of arrests if you look at the arrests they are misdemeanors meaning driving while intoxicated they are smaller things felonies really serious crimes these are people who typically violate the law consistently so when they are this is happening i we would memorize what the usc would say is that the law is not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law it's not a law the secret service did is they taught us to fight with facts i fight with facts so we actually memorized the title codes like 18 title 18 usc was it 3056 that gave me the right to do what i needed to do to secure and protect the president of the united states and if you were interfering with that then the law gave me the right to arrest you if i needed to i did not want to arrest anybody i did not care but the law gave me that right because now you are impeding in my ability to do my job so one of the things that i learned from the law is that you are not going to be able to do anything if you are not going to be able to do anything if you are not going to be able to do anything things i would do is i would say ma'am you are right now impeding with title 18 3056 and i would say the title of what it was which says that i have to do x y and z so here's the thing i do not want to arrest you but you do need to move across the street you can move across the street and i can get somebody to come talk to you or you know it's going to escalate it's up to you most people steven most listen but a lot of people like theatrics you said it's up to you that's giving them an element of control which is good that's a good point i think that's a good point i think that's it's up to me look at the end they have to do it because i have to do my job right but the majority of time but you have given them the choice because you said you can either this or this yes but sometimes you have to repeat it like 15 times to people before you actually do it here's the thing once you put hands on people the last thing you want to do is put hands on people the minute you put hands on people everything breaks back they are going to freak out somebody's going to get hurt they are going to it's it's not a good thing the majority of people i would arrest after i would arrest them i would have to take them to the hospital not because i did anything to hurt them but my heart hurts i am stressed i have i do not know what's happening i have a headache i do not want them to die on me and the majority of the time i would take them to the hospital or they were faking it i have had people fake heart attacks because they thought i would feel bad and take the cuffs off and i am like okay are you having a heart attack let me put the cuffs on we are going straight to the hospital and i would take them to the hospital so there's a lot of tactics people would use to also get you to stop manipulators which people can do the average person not in this way but ways people can manipulate you to stop whatever it is you are doing let's say you are trying to find out the truth of something or you are in you are trying to get to your asking questions and a person does not like it they may start crying people would cry when i would arrest them as a way for me to feel sorry to stop so often people will use things to get you to feel bad to leave the hospital and they are not going to leave them alone let's say you are going to fire somebody because for something they did and you are asking them questions and they start crying in the office instead of asking the questions right that's a way to deflect to get you to feel bad to stop your line of fire of questions to get you to stop very common very common crying it's a manipulation tactic tactic and there's other things people can do so people will use certain things to get you to stop what you are doing and sometimes people fall for it or they will say things to you you are only doing this to me because i am a woman or because i am this and those sometimes not that they are not true but a lot of times it can be used as manipulators to get you to back off in that scenario you are being met with emotion and it appears that you are returning logic because you are talking about the title code and you could i guess return emotion but no no you own your emotion nobody should provoke you nobody you are stephen bartlett director of ceo nobody provokes you you own your responsibility but that's not what it is you are going because you have всё you are going to take that out you are going to take the responsibility and do you want it and whoomo bs no well he trained you in that space but at the same time had other people's opinions and whole way your strongly against the truth makers what i一點 happened you know was you say stuff about And sometimes I am like, stop.  Like everybody does not need to know what you are thinking.  Like stop posting.  We put so much noise out there because we think people care.  They do not.  It's like, even though when you speak, I look at social media the same way.  What are you contributing to the world?  Are you?  Post it.  If you are not, do not post it.  Do not put more noise.  Your contribution points, even in your posts and the things you share with the world.

But I look at it this way.  You are at a point, I understand when you are young.  Up until you are 25 years old, I give you a free pass because that frontal cortex of yours is not developed.  You are not emotionally regulated.

But then there comes a point where you have to own your emotions.  I had to because I would lose my job.  How do I become unprovocable?  Is there a way?  Or is it just by repetitions?  It's repetition.  If enough people get in your face, over time, you learn to manage your emotions.

But if you spent the whole time avoiding people getting in your face, I am not telling you to go look for problems.

But you should not go out of your, your way to avoid conflict to such a degree where you are willing to do anything and whatever because you do not want conflict.  I do not want conflict.  I do not like it.

But if it shows up in my face, I am going to be there.  You can also handle people non-emotionally with facts.  Okay, earlier on you said X, Y, and Z.  Could you explain that to me?  Even sometimes when people tell me, you know, I feel like I am not valued at work or I think my boss does not care about me or I believe this and I want to go talk to my boss.  And I will tell them, I am fine with you going talk to your boss when they would ask me for advice because I never give unsolicited advice.  I am fine with you going in there, but do not go in there and say, I think, I feel, I believe.  Go in there and say, hey, I did this project.  I spent X amount of hours on it and I made X amount of money for this company.  You know, I would like to put in for a higher position or I would like to put in for this other project.  Go in with the facts.  Facts win because it's harder for people to refute facts.  I think I should get this.  Well, I think you should get this.  I think you should not.  I believe, you know, you are treating me this way.  Well, I believe I am not.

But if you say, we had this meeting, during this meeting you said this and this, could you explain that to me because it seemed as though you did not trust me in that meeting or it seemed as though you were upset with me in that meeting.

But I am telling you specifically what I did.  So I am bringing you back to that specific fact a moment versus now, I feel that you treat me this way.  It's so vague and ambiguous.  When you go in with very specific things, that's harder to, to argue.  You want to, not that I want you to win an argument, but you really want to make your point and get results.  Be very clear and specific.  And you know what, if you are nervous, write it down.  I always tell people, write your stuff down.  Walk into a meeting, if you are having it with your supervisor, sir, boss, I do not know if people say sir anymore.  I used to have to say sir.  Sir, I just, I took some notes down.  So I hope you do not mind.  I am just going to look to it just to make sure I, I speak clearly and I do not make any mistakes.  And then go through the points.  I actually asked a, a colleague of mine who was in a similar situation, who wanted to have a conversation with me.  And their slightly younger colleague of mine, in their early twenties, they said they wanted to speak to me about something.  And my advice to them was actually to write it down in a memo, as if you were writing a story, because I love narrative memos.  And I did that because I wanted them to properly think about what they wanted to say, because I knew what would happen is they would come in, they would start sort of like, falling over their words a little bit.  They might not, not fully give me all the context.  And I often do that now, which is in all my meetings that we do, we kind of stole this from Jeff Bezos, Amazon is I will have someone write it into, even if it's a two page memo, which says like, this is the situation.  This is why I am bringing you this thing in this meeting.  This is my proposed solution.  This is the decision I need, you know, super, super clear because in business, you often find what, you know, when you have two kinds of sides of things, either someone walks in and freestyles with them, their voice and they stumble in the moment, they do not get things out properly.  Or someone comes in with like a hundred page PowerPoint presentation, which is like vague pictures of things and bullet points.  And I hate a fucking bullet point because a bullet point is open to interpretation.  So is a picture.  Whereas these narrative memos, which is what Amazon and Jeff Bezos figured out, they leave no room for ambiguity and all the context is there.  And actually, sometimes it actually means that they can just send it as an email.  And then you do not have to talk to them.  And then I do not have to do the hour and a half.  Dude, it's funny you say that.  When I did, I did a lot of cases.  I would always ask.  And again, not because I knew to do this, I was trained to do this, but really good interview is get people to write, not a memo, but a statement before you even interview them, you know?  And if it was like the date of the crime, for example, tell me what you did from the time you woke up on this date to the time you went to sleep.  And it would be a memo of what they did that day, or tell me what you know about blah, blah, blah, blah.  And I would read those statements and I would know often who was my suspect, who was not.  I had one case where baby was a few months old.  Baby had a broken arm and it was between the dad and the nanny that police were looking at.  And police were not sure which one it was.  We think it's either the nanny or their dad.  Now in a criminal case, you always want to talk to them.  The most likely suspect.  You do not build your way up.  I go to the person who I likely think did it.  I am going straight to the person, right?  I do not want to go to the person.  I think maybe did it and then build my way there.  I want the one.  I want the person.  I want the person that I truly believe is my suspect, my offender.  So I get the statements and I read them both.  I read dads and I read nannies.  I read dads and I am like, it's not dad.  I knew from the statement it was not dad.  I read nannies and I knew right away after I read nanny's statement, she did it.  Now you are going to say, how did you know?  The nanny opened up her statement by telling me about her morning, how frustrated it was, how she was running late.  She had two little kids of her own.  She was trying to get them out.  She was a single mom.  She was stressed out and she shows up to work to take care of this baby.  The baby's fussing.  The baby's crying.  I did this.  It did not work.  I did that.  It did not work.  So as she's telling me the story, she's telling me how hard her day was.  And then she turns into how frustrated she was with this baby.  I did everything I could to get this baby to stop crying.  I think the baby was, you see the three or six months old.  I am just, I cannot remember.  And the baby was this and the baby was that.  And then she was like, when she gets to part where it says, then I gave the baby Tylenol and it went quiet.  And I was like, there it is.  That's when she broke the baby's arm.  Who says I gave the baby Tylenol and it went quiet.  In that moment, her language had changed so much.  I was like, that's the moment she snapped that baby's arm and the baby passed out from the pain.

And so, I get the statement, I call up the law enforcement entity with the state police, because they were the ones that asked me to come up.  And I said, I want to talk to Nanny, not to dad.  And sure enough, Nanny comes in, hour and a half later, I had a confession.  I did not even have to give her a polygraph.  What was interesting is in her statement, it sounded like she was actually self-justifying her behavior.  She was.  She absolutely was.  I was reading about this thing called cognitive dissonance that you just mentioned, and this idea that we do not like the gap between the way we are behaving and who we think we are or want to be.  And when I think about myself and bad habits that I have or bad habits that my friends have, we all justify, justify, I am too busy so I could not go to the gym.  Or there was nothing else that I could grab so I ate the cookie in the mini bar.  Like we have to find a way to justify it.  And then some of us, I think we build our lives around kind of believing our own justifications.  Of course we do.  And then we are trapped.  Because in the presence of these crazy justifications, what we are doing makes sense and it's okay.  I think sometimes it's, I am not telling people to feel permanently bad for what they do, because you do not want to, like we said, you do not want to live in the past and beat yourself up and man, I messed up and I did this.  You will.

But I do think it's important to say, I did something and I should not have done this.  At least to yourself.  How do you stop believing your own bullshit?  Well.  Or do you?  I think, so I am very lucky.  I have a husband who makes sure that I do not.  He is, but he's a very steady, good soundboard, but he's also former special agent, both in US Secret Service and Homeland Security.  And he was SWAT.  So this is a super steady person.  Lost his father when he was young.  I am only sharing this because you are asking.  I guess what I am saying is, so I have someone in my very inner circle who will tell me, hey, chucklehead, you might want to think this through.  He may not say it like that, but he will call me out on things.  People that care about you will typically call things out on you.  Now there's ways to do it and ways not to do it.  And there's maybe times where I am not really keen on the way he does it, but because he has good contribution points, good credibility with me, I know if he's saying something, that there's validity to it.  If he's going to pause and say, hey, I would like you to think about this.  It's coming from somewhere.  So he's built enough trust.  I have built enough trust to know that he does that.

Now, if you have someone who's always critiquing you, because that does exist, everything you do is wrong, then that person's not going to, you know, they are not going to resonate.  So I think having people that actually call you out on your stuff or help point it out, that can do it, and that you also have to be okay with listening it.  So I am mature enough.  And I hope to be, I try to be humble enough to say, look, tell me the truth.  Or there are times too, where as much as a strategic decision maker I like to be, there's times where, Steven, I am seeing red.  Someone will do something and all I see is red.  And I will go to someone that I can either, either I trust or can help me make a decision with something.  And I will say, you know, it could be my agent.  It could be a work thing.  I am like, hey, this happened.  I am seeing red.  How would you handle this scenario?  Because I am in an emotional state.  I am not going to make a good decision.  Can I have your guidance advice?  And so I will go to people I trust who will guide me.  So that's the biggest thing.  I think call yourself out on your bullshit.  The minute you start getting emotional, and I think there's a pattern.  If everything offends you, if everything upsets you, if you are getting triggered all the time, if you are upset with people or angry with people, or you feel the need to let everybody know through social media or posts or texting, you can always call yourself out on your own bullshit.  And I think that's the biggest thing.  And it's funny because I have been doing that for a long time.  And I feel like I am doing it all the time.  And I have been doing it for a long time.  And I feel like it's the biggest thing in life.  And I am like, I feel like I am doing it all the time.  And I am like, why?  Why am I doing all of this?  Why am I doing all of this?  And it's like, I do not know.  What's going on in your life.  I want you to pause and say, why am I doing all of this?  What is going on within me that I am feeling that I need to, No.  I did growing up.  I was my social butterfly.  No.  And just so you know, the research shows, Steven, that as we age, our inner circle gets smaller and smaller and smaller.  I have a lot of acquaintances, and I am friendly with a lot of people, and I network with a lot of people, and I like these people.

But when I hear the word friends, I could count my friends on one hand.  Do you have a lot of friends?  You might, because you might still be at an age where you are kind of in the middle there.  For me, I have got like five best friends, but then I have got all these other people who I have become friends with, predominantly through work.  Okay, so I define friends as people you would give pretty much unconditional trust to.  Unconditional, I trust you, I will tell you whatever.  More or less.  How many would those be?  I reckon 10.  10, unconditional trust.  Okay.  Jack's one of them.  Jack over there is one of them.  I have known him for seven years now.  There's nothing I would not trust him with.  So that would be a legitimate, yes, that would be a friend, right?  Consistency, length of time, trust, no betrayal.  That would be a friend.  And is this a quality versus quantity game, do you think, the inner circle?  Yes.  Why do you need all those people?  It's one thing to have connections and network and meet people and hang out, but who you bring into that inner circle, I think, and I would think even for you, you want to be selective and careful because you also want to make sure people, if Steven was not Steven, like what quality friends would they still be?  Because sometimes it's also what the package is and people are drawn to us, and that's okay.

But I guess what I am saying is it's quality.  Are they genuinely good friends?  Like if something bad happens and you are like, I need your help, and they are like, let me, would they be like, let me go get my shovel?  Where are we meeting?  You know, I think that would be the gauge of a friend, but I think sometimes people think a lot of friends are good and a lot of friends are noise.  You can have acquaintances, but you are like, your friend is really somebody who influences you.  I did something at 24 years old that has had a profound impact on my life.  I set myself the challenge of posting every single day on my social media channels.  And at the time I was doing it to grow my following, but it had this profound impact on my life.  And two remarkable things happened when I did that.  I managed to learn faster because every single day I am capturing what is happening to me and trying to distill it down into something that I can share with the world.

But more remarkably, it led me to building a following of many millions of people.  And that's the basis that I used to launch the Diary of a CEO.  And that's why I want to tell you about our sponsor today, Adobe Express.  They are the platform that I use to make all the posts across my LinkedIn and across my Instagram.  It's a couple of clicks and you do not need to be an expert.  And that is why I love using it because I am not an expert in graphic design.  It's accessible to use for all of us, even if we do not have the technical prowess to design great things.  So if you want to start compounding both your reach and your knowledge like I did at 24 years old, then head to adobe.  Ly slash Steven and get started with Adobe Express.  That's adobe.  Ly slash Steven.

Look at low vibration as when you are around people and it's just, you do not want to be around them.  They make you feel bad, not because they said something necessarily to you, but they are maybe in a victim mindset.  They are always bringing problems.  They are always bringing drama.  Everything is wrong.  Nothing is right.  They are all low vibration.  Can you be low vibration around because you are low vibra-?  Low vibra-?  Low vibration people?  Yes, because you adopt their habits.  You adopt and are influenced by people.  Does not matter who you are.  You can be, you can be Steven Bartlett, Dyer of a CEO.  If you surround yourself with low vibration people, eventually, slowly, it's going to bring down your vibration.  It's easier for, if you are up here, let's say higher vibration, I am doing really well.  I am, I am, I am, I am excelling in the way I think, emotionally stable.  You are kind of doing really well in life and you are up here.  And you are around people like down here and you are thinking, oh, I am going to help pull this person up, right?  It is actually easier for them to pull you down than it is for you to pull people up.  You know, I always say, be careful who you try to save.  Some people will drown you.  It's like when we would do a rescue search and rescue, they would tell you when you got out in the water, the most dangerous thing is not the water.  It's the person who's panicking in the water who could kill you.  Because as you get closer to them to save them, what are they doing, Steven?  They are panicking.  They are flailing.  Then they see you.  What do they do?  They grab onto you so they can stay afloat.  You know what they do?  They push you down.  You are there to save them.

But in their panic and then their loss and then their chaos, what do they do?  They push you down.  People are the same way just in relationships.  So all I am saying is I am not telling you not to be a person who's going out there to help others, but be selective in how you do it and who you help.  Because then you fall into that, that, that space of I am such a, I am just trying to be a good person.  I am trying to do this.  I am trying to do that.  I am trying to do that.  I am trying to do that.  No, you are exposing yourself to people and environments that are not good for you and that actually impact your life negatively.  And so it's not on them.  It's also we have a responsibility to ourselves, Steven, to make good decisions on where we go, what relationships we enter, who we are dealing with, and what we are doing.  We have a responsibility.  So if somebody screws us over, I get it.  Every once in a while you come across an asshole and it happens.

But if it's a consistent thing, it's always a responsibility.  Also, what did I do?  What did I allow myself to do that exposed me to this volatility, that exposed me to this stuff?  It's like crime.  If I walk home every night in a sketchy area with the lights are dark and there's no lighting and I know there's high crime and it's an abandoned area, that choice I am making to walk through that neighborhood versus taking a taxi, that will make me more likely to be what?  A victim of crime.

But if I take a taxi, I am less likely to be a victim of crime.  I avoid this bad neighborhood.  I avoid this bad area.  I guess what I am saying is, you also have a responsibility.  We have a responsibility to navigate the environment we are in and how we engage with people.  And it cannot just be he or she screwed me over.  It's like what decision did you make?  It's not blame, but what decision did you make that exposed you and made you more vulnerable to getting screwed over?  Because typically, maybe not all, but the majority of times, there are signs that we choose to ignore.  Or we think everybody's our friend.  And we give them unconditional trust.  And then something happens and we think, why did that happen?  Well, you gave unconditional trust like it was nothing.  Your trust should be something people earn.  You do not have to tell them you need to earn my trust.  You do not have to say it.

But internally, it's kind of like you need to earn this.  Because it means something to give people trust.  You should not just automatically surrender it to you.  So Jack, what's up Jack?  Jack over seven years earned trust consistently and over time.  And that's why that relationship's the same way.

But you are responsible.  We are each responsible for ourselves.  So if you keep exposing yourself to low vibration, to chaotic areas, chaotic people, then you are playing a role in the problems that you have.  We live in a culture though where people do complain a lot.  They complain that things are not fair, that they are not equal, that they are not being treated like they should be treated, etc, etc.  And there's a lot of that in the corporate world.  Because it's allowed.  I think it's okay to meet people where they are sometimes and listen to them.  I think it's valid.

But it's also when you bend so much, you are also doing a disservice to them because you are helping make excuses for them.  They are not delivering.  And it hurts the work culture.  And I think you really have to be careful because a person who comes in with poor performance can really impact the rest of the team.  And I have had it.  Like I do not have as many employees as you have.

But when I have people that work with me, I am very aware of how their vibration comes in and impacts the other team.  I want high performance.  And if you are coming in with your low vibration and your problems and your dramas, it does not belong at work.  What is the defining sort of attitude trait of a low performer?  If you just had to pick one, the first thing that comes to mind that pisses you off?  It does not piss me off.

But when people start telling me about their personal affairs.  And it's not that I am an insensitive person.  There's a time and place.  So if you start telling me about how your weekend was with your grandmother or whoever.  And I am sitting there.  I am like, it's not that I am insensitive but it's we are at work.  Like I asked you about something specific and you are telling me about this whole story about.  So you are making it about you.  And I think that there's a little bit like did you not pause to think like I am talking to my supervisor or my boss.  She's super busy.  She's expecting something from me.

Let me share it with her.  You know, when you do that to another person, you take from them all the time.  How's that fair to them?  At the start of that, you said they would come and talk about themselves, etc.  And it reminded me of something you were talking about in your TED talk where one of the key ideas is that you are not that special.  What do you mean when you say you are not that special?  You are not that special is.  When we make ourselves so self-important, which in Western culture we have, it's very much about the person, the identity of the person.  You can do anything.  You can this.  It's you, you, you.  I think that's great.

But what happens is when we get so focused on the singular person and we forget other people is that we think that we are so special that it's just us and then the rest of the world revolves around us.  We are the sun and then everybody else revolves around us.  And when you think you are special, it's not that you become a narcissist or anything like that.  That's not how I mean it.  What I mean by that is if I am special, then what also that says is my problems are special, my pain is special, what I am going through is special.  And you meet those people where it's like, oh, no, no, no, this is just happening to me, that mindset.  And when you are there, you are alone.  And there's nothing that anybody can do to help you, even when they give you advice.  Because you are the exception to everything.  When you have that mindset, at least when I had that mindset, all my problems faded away.  As bad as they were or whatever hardship I was going through, I am like, I am not that special.  There's other people going through it far worse than I am.  It does not minimize what I am going through, but it reorients you.  You also talk about walking with conviction because predators can spot prey.  Yes.  Did you see that through your career that predators, narcissists would go for you?  Yes.  Would go for certain people?  Yes.

But even in regular relationships, why do some people end up with a bad partner all the time or an abusive partner all the time?  Why?  Do not throw me under the bus.  You say it.

But why?  Because we tend to draw to us those folks because we look like we are easier targets.  We look like they are people they can mold or manipulate.  We try to.  We trust too easily.  I am not telling you not to give trust, but there are certain traits that they look at.  They are not going to go after an alpha type personality.  You know, it's if you look like you are an easy target, if you look like you are easy to take down, if you look like you are easily going to be thrown off, people see that.  They pay attention.

But if they look like you are a competitor, if they look like you are a counter predator, and you do not even have to be that extreme, but if they look like, hey, this person is going to push back.  I am going to be careful.  Even with some people you talk to, I bet employees, there's some employees that you are probably more comfortable telling something to because they are more easily, they are easier to tell it to.  They are softer in tone.  Maybe they are not going to push back.  They are easier.  And then there are other employees where you are like, I have to think about how I say this because this person's a strong alpha personality.  And so I have to approach them a little bit differently.

Now, people are the same way.  We give off cues.  We give off vibes.  And so.  And to some people we can look like easier targets.  Even in crime.  Crime.  They pick their targets.  They do not want fair fights.  They want, I want someone who's going to go down easy.  Kids are the most overly abused population.  Why?  Because they are kids.  They are the easiest to target.  They are the most vulnerable.  Why?  So if I am such a strong predator, why am I going for kids?  Or next, elderly.  Why am I going for elderly?  Because they are easy for me to conquer.  They are easy for me to take down.  Predators are not what you think they are.  Even if you look at recent events, if you look at recent shootings we have had.  When you look at the people that have carried out some of these shootings, there was one recently this week with Charlie Kirk.  Look at that shooter.  Does he look like a predator to you?  I do not mean it in a cold way.  Just as you look at.  There was one before that here in the United States.  It was the Minneapolis school shooting.  Did you see that shooter?  Does that look like a predator to you?  These predators that we envision in our head that we think are these ruthless, scary looking people.  They tend to not be that.  They themselves are not strong.  They look for weaker targets because it's easier to take out and manipulate.  Predators are not these.  It's not like what you see in the movie.  The movies.  Like you think you are going to see this scary looking dude.  I am not saying you are not going to see that from time to time.

But these people who do certain things, who take advantage, they do not look like predators.  And you have to be careful because you inadvertently attract people who look at you and think, I can manage her.  I can do that.  I can mold that.  I can shape that.  And in the context of work or relationships, if there's my boss is shouting at me and constantly berating me or my partner is shouting at me and berating me.  And I just feel small.  I cannot necessarily call for backup.  So is it as simple as saying I should just leave?  Or is there, what if it's a situation where I cannot leave?  Like it's like family or sometimes in work, you know, you have to stay because you need to pay your bills.  Or there's, you know, kids involved and I am married to this person.  Okay.  So you are saying you cannot leave.  Yes, if I could not leave.  I always feel like there's a choice.  It may not be the choice you want to make.

But it's the choice you want to make.

But you always have a choice.  Because in those scenarios, if you have got, let's say, and I have had a lot of people come to me and they are truly abusive relationships.  There is no advice I can give you to fix that.  That person is just going to abuse you, let alone from you assaulting them back.  And then now you are having like, God forbid, like somebody's dead, which does happen.  I cannot fix that.  What I can do is for a person like that.  And most people do not leave abusive relationships.  The research, I have talked to a lot of people that work with abuse victims.  They find that even when they do leave, the vast majority go back.  So I think that's a scenario.  If you have someone like that in your life, the best thing you could do for them is listen and just try to keep them as safe as you can.  I do not think there is nothing I can do.  What are you going to do?  Get a gun.  And then what?  You are going to use it?  People, I think, Effie, they almost want you to help them.  You are going to help them stay in that situation, but change the situation.  No, change the person.  It's the iceberg we talked about.  They are not accepting the truth of who they have in front of them.  We do not accept the truth.  I have this person and this person is horrible to me.  They are abusive to me.  They are vile to me.  And I think if I could just get them to not be like that, everything would be okay.  Okay.  Of course it would.

But that's not the truth.  You are not living in truth.  You have somebody who is horrible to you.

Now, if it's an insult.

Now, if it's an intimate personal relationship like a companion, that's a big thing because you live with that person.  There's no getting away from them.  Typically, if you have a companion or you get married, you are what?  Typically, unless you divorce, you are tied to that person.  That's really rough.

Now, let's say it's a parent or a kid because kids can be just as abusive to parents.  Actually, the research shows, at least here in the United States, I cannot remember the most recent year I looked at.  It was the Uniform Crime Report, I believe.  It showed there was more abuse from child to parent.  And parent to child, relationship-wise.  I do not mean a five-year-old hitting their parent.  I mean it can be an adult child being abusive to a parent.

But let's say you have a scenario like that.

Now, there is a point at some degree where you can remove yourself either from the parent's house.  Let's say you live with your parents.  I get this sometimes a lot.  My parents are like this or they are like that to me.  And I am like, how old are you?  If you are over the age of 18 and you can work, you have the ability to find ways to remove yourself.  You do not have to cut them out of your life because sometimes for people it's really, really hard.  They love their family.  As messed up as they are, you can love your family, but you do not have to like them.  Those are two different things.  I had a scenario like that where there was a certain member of my extended family who was being inappropriate.  And I was the first—this was when I was younger.  I was like 18.  I said to my siblings, I said, I know you guys are going to stay and tolerate it and you are going to justify it in your own way.  That's not the approach I am going to take.  Why?  I am going to cut them off.  And funnily enough, this person treats me the best.  They treat me the best.  And I think it's because they realize that my tolerance is so low and I am willing to walk away and that I do not think family means that you are bound to this person for life.  I do think you still get to choose.  I think like all relationships in your life, there should be a certain standard that they have to meet, whether they are family, friends, a stranger, or a team member, whoever it is, that they have to meet like a minimum standard.  And family for me, just do not get a pass on that.  And funnily, it meant that my relationship with— I have never fallen out with this person.  The only reason I said that was because I see them falling out with everybody else.  And this was, again, before the podcast and whatever else, like before my businesses.  I was a broke student.

But I just, I, for whatever reason, probably some trauma-related reason, felt no obligation to keep you in my life just because we have the same genes.  For me, that's like not a high enough bar.  And they treated me so well.  That's so interesting because you stood your ground.  Yes.  And this is where sometimes we talk about the—you know how we are talking about the bad things that have happened to us and we carry them through?  It's one thing to go through something bad and then you move through it, right?  You moved on.

But when you stay in something bad—so like if you are in a relationship and there's continual trauma, there's no—you cannot move through that because you are staying there.  It's not it happened to you and you are staying in this victim mindset.  It's like you are still in it.  Chronic abuse, chronic trauma, chronic whatever.  However you want to define it.  And abuse can look differently.  Or chronically having somebody bully you, that's really bad.  That's really bad.  There's no strategies.  There's no skills.  And I would get those folks and they are like, can you help me be more confident, be more this?  And it would come out in the discussions I would have that they had somebody that was in their life that was bullied or abusive.  And I would tell them there are no skills I can give you that can help you be more confident because I cannot—I cannot do it.  I cannot do it.  I cannot counter that.  You have someone who is consistently demolishing you.  And so you think what?  I am going to tell you to what?  Do a power pose?  And that's going to fix it?  Do you feel like you have—and I do not know.  I am asking out of humbleness.  I do not know.  Do you feel that growing up you had a lot of people that around you that were either, you know, had a lot of issues or struggles and like that it was something that you had to push through or climb out to get through?  Yes.  I think it really only takes like one person that's close enough, especially if they are above you, to basically—in my case, to make my tolerance level extremely low.  I think people can relate to that because I hear people say this all the time.  Like it only takes one parent that did X or one parent that did this or, you know, an uncle or an auntie or whatever that you go, I am going to tolerate zero of that.  So another thing in my relationship with my partner.  And I grew up in a house where shouting was the background noise of every day, like from morning till night.  And so with me and my partner, I have been together for seven years.  We talk like this.  It's not to say we do not argue or we do not have disagreements.  We do not get upset or whatever.

But there's never shouting because I just have zero tolerance for that.  I would just—frankly, in my previous relationship, when the shouting began, I would literally just disappear from the space.  And I would be in my car driving down the motorway.  That was my response because I just—because I grew up in a house where that was—and my siblings are all the same.  None of them shout or very, very calm or very softly spoken because we grew up in an environment which was the opposite.

But that's interesting too because it could have gone the other way.  Yes, and it sometimes does for people.  It does.  You talked about the abuse.  Violence often comes from violence.

But sometimes, like, peace comes from violence.  That's true.  This is also why when you said earlier that looking back at your past and trying to figure out what happened is not necessarily useful because two kids in the same environment can turn out entirely different.  And you see that across siblings.  There's something interesting you were saying a second ago about—we were talking about, like, gradual small exposure therapy to change your life for the better, moving the shoes closer to the bed.

But then you also just talked about the gradual exposure therapy of someone breaching your boundaries and becoming an abuser.  And how it's like—it's like a— It's like they just every day just move the shoes a little bit closer to the bed.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes, it's interesting.  It goes both ways in that regard.  When I—you know, with my inner circle, like, even with people I work with, if I start—I really pay attention to behavior.  If, like—this is something small, and I do not know if you are the same way.

But, like, if you work with me or—well, you work for me, and I send you an email, and you do not respond until four days later, massive red flag for me.  And I will not say anything to you.  I will wait.  And then I will test it out again with something else and again.  And as soon as I see that, in my head, I am like, we are done.  I may not tell you anything, but I will find a way to let you go.  So there's a certain things because—and that's a little bit like the moving the shoes closer away from the bed where you will see people—you will see—I will see somebody do something, and I am like, is it a fluke?  -.  Do they truly miss it?  Or is this kind of this relaxed attitude?  Oh, it's Evy.  She's so—well, I do not know if they think I am nice, but— You know, after I do these podcasts, I am like, oh, she's so scary.

But, you know, sometimes people will get too relaxed and comfortable, and so it's in a different way.  And so I will test it out.  And when I see that, I am like, no, no, I am not—you know, if it's someone I really want to work with, I may address it.

But sometimes—I do not want to say I do not invest the time and energy and effort, but sometimes I know when to invest that time, energy, and effort.

I want to say no.  And I play.  I pull out.  Earlier on, we talked about Charlie Kirk.  This week—what week are we in?  We are on Sunday.  So yes, this week he was assassinated while on a college campus as part of a tour that he was doing called Prove Me Wrong, where he went out onto college campuses and debated his ideas with the college campus students.  And a shooter, who has now been found and I believe is in prison currently awaiting— Jail.  Jail, yes.  Jail.  Jail, yes.  Jail, yes.  And his first appearance, I think, in court on Tuesday of this week, shot him in the neck from several hundred yards away.  As a former Secret Service agent whose very job was to ensure that did not happen to someone, to ensure that someone did not assassinate them, harm them, keep them safe, etc.  What did you think and feel when you heard the news?  So I have been covering the Charlie Kirk assassination from the news perspective.  So you are asking me, like, what assessment can I give you as a former Secret Service agent?  So I will give you something.  I will share with you what I have been covering.  And if you have a specific question, feel free to ask.  So here's the thing.  This is truly unique and exceptional.  And this is why.  People calling it a political assassination, right?  It is and it is not.  Here's the difference.  A president of the United States is a politician.  He's—it's understood that things like this will happen, right?  And he has protection.  A political appointee like me, I do not know if you have heard this, but I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee.  I am a political appointee anditié.  I am a political appointee anditié.  I am a political appointee.  And I think, you know, this communications stuff actually comes together when you give people a platform to discuss issues and facts.  I have�)" been aав będą I am from Senator McCarthy and my former örgy is in w lessons in there.  And I haveинv been a political appointee for the last four years.  So most people in the United States is a politician.  I am including others inarkachan, what ever, not as many people in the S.  P.  A.  I think I am up to a sedãder than I kind of daughter, like Brunello Dollman, bullets made with batteries, it was not maybe, I do not know, I do not know.  And they did all of this.  They did al inte eff Сudzidazzabu and Antiksi.  Parts of the world are very afraid right now because their threats have also increased.  So even here in the United States, they are looking to increase the budget on people in Congress for safety and protection.  It is to some degree understood that these things will happen over time to people who are political elected figures.  Charlie is uniquely different.  He talked about things, but he was not a political figure.  Nobody voted for him.  He was honestly, he had his own, did not he have his own podcast?  He had a podcast.  He was out there.  He spoke.  He did talks.  He shared his opinion.  So he's no different in a sense than you and I, in a sense.  And so what that assassination means is it is fair game now on anybody who has a platform.  That's the difference here.  So it's different.  You are not dealing with presidents now, heads of states, or people in Congress.  You are dealing now with people who, if they share an opinion that you do not like, and I perceive it as a threat, then now I have the ability to retaliate and take a shot.  This is going to open up the door to copycats because to try to get certain people like a president of the United States or a member of Congress or a politician or certain people, those are hard targets.  Those are hard to get.  They are secure.

But now this means anybody who's out there that I do not like and I do not agree with, I can take that target and cause harm to those people.  We are moving into a space now where everybody is fair game.  Where I have a voice.  Even on social media, I would actually sit and go through X before I would go on air just to get the news updates, see what else was happening.  And I would have to sit and filter through all the hateful comments people were writing, everybody to each other.  And then every other five comments was, I am getting death threats.  People are threatening me because people were expressing their opinions online and other people were threatening them.  This means that it means you can go after anybody.  And what I am not saying I would like this to happen, but to me, this is a massive red flag because it means now everybody is extremely vulnerable.  And now we are looking to targeting people who have shows, who have platforms, who maybe do the dues, who share opinions.  That is why this is a bother.  This is why people should be concerned.  You said copycats.  Is that something that you actually saw when you are in the Secret Service?  That if one incident happens, you are going to be the one to be concerned?  100%.  All it takes is one person to do it.  Another person would be like, oh, he can do it.  I can do it.  He executed his mission.  I am not agreeing with the mission, but that shooter was able to do what he needed to do.  And he was successful, sadly.  Right?  So someone else is going to see it and they are going to get that idea.  I am speaking at a university on Tuesday.  So maybe somebody hears something I say on a podcast.  They do not like it.  They might get that idea.

But also there's a lot of people out there that are just not well.  I mean.  No, they are not well.  I am going to be very transparent.  People are not well.  So in the U.  S.  Secret Service, we had a unit.  It was called the Protective Intelligence Unit.  In that unit is where we would track people who were presumed to be threats against people who were protected.  So how did they get on your radar?  They would write letters.  They would show up at multiple events.  They would make phone calls, right?  There was ways to do that.  Then you have the introduction of social media.  So now people are more.  People to now make threats and say things from the safety of their own home.  And that is afraid.  It's a it's a it's a more detached way to attack somebody.  And now you have to follow those leads.  And now there's thousands of these things that come in.  And even if they even hit your radar.  And so everyone's in the nun dated with tracking people.

Now, at the time, initially, those who were looking to cause harm to our protect these typically typically had severe mental health issues.  And from time to time, it was not often the Secret Service would work with the courts to involuntarily commit somebody if they thought they were that much harm.  With social media now, the the playing field has changed one, it allows people to say things that they would never say to your face.  It's allows people now when you absorb the content online, the majority is very negative, even though we are talking about this event.  Everything is typically very ugly online.  And so people escalate.  And we have also noticed that there's a lack of empathy, we are less empathetic, the more we have exposure to online stuff.  Because when people text hateful things, it does not become as a big of a deal anymore.  Whereas if somebody said it to you, it's a bigger deal.  So there is a severe mental issue with people.  And there's also, when you look at behavior, typically, the things that keep you in check seem to be a little bit more absent today, which also causes people to behave a little bit more inappropriately.  So like, and this is again, just for the research, not based on my personal opinion, family, when you have strong social bonds to certain structures, you are less likely to cause harm to others.  So family is one, one social bond, that keeps you in check.  Keeps you kind of like in place.  Like I am not going to do this because it would embarrass my family, hurt my family.  A faith or religion, religious institutions, whatever that religion is that typically keeps people kind of steady.  Certain institutions, like having a strong bond to what may be a school or a certain institutions.  There are certain things that keep you less likely from behaving this way.  And we do see a little bit of an erosion in those areas.  And I think that leaks into people's mental cognitive issues.  One of the things that I do not think people realize as well when they are on the internet is that they are in an algorithm and the algorithm is not the real world, but it's actually just the things, the way that the algorithm works is it shows you more of the things that you have expressed interest in before.  So my first sort of 10 years of my career was working in social media.  So all of the major social platforms, we bought one of the most disruptive social media companies at the time.  So I have a deep understanding of how the algorithm works.  In fact, much of our job is to figure out how it works, to help our big clients globally reach more people.  And I think about like my grandfather.  My grandfather will like look at his phone and he will think what he's seeing is the world, but he does not know that dwell time is a huge factor in what he's going to be shown tomorrow.  So if he dwells a little bit more on a particular post, the algorithm will go, oh, Mr.  Bartlett, grandfather Bartlett is interested.  So next time you log in, we are going to show more of that.  And I learned this really starkly when one of my older relatives downloaded TikTok and I got like an emergency call from their partner saying, we need your help.  She's downloaded TikTok and it's like making her crazy.  Like it's making her insane because she's seeing now all of this like vitriol and hate and racist stuff.  And she thinks the world is like that and she's like preparing to protest.  So I had to get her password of her partner and hit this, the backend of TikTok, which refreshes your algorithm, just wipes out all of your history.  And what I would do is I would hit that button every single week and eventually she stopped using TikTok.  She found it boring because it was all now like X factor.  America's got talent videos, people singing, people dancing.  And I would go on her phone and I would watch these like music videos and I would like like them and bookmark them and save them because I knew that that's what she would see next time she logged in.  I know this sounds crazy, but that's like, people do not realize that what they are seeing is they are pulling something towards them.  And that's how the algorithms work.  You pull towards you what you have been historically interested in.  So if you are scared about brown people crossing the border in dinghies.  That's all it's going to show you.  It's going to pull you more of that stuff.  And you are going to start thinking that the world is X, Y, or Z.  And yes.  The other thing too, when it shows you that stuff, it's almost like being, how I said, when you are in law enforcement, you are exposed to the worst of people and you have to be really cared not to become cynical.  And one of the ways that you are also protected is because you are with other officers.  So there's that team camaraderie.  Everybody helps each other.  So now this is the same way.  I am on my phone and I am exposed to the worst of the worst and I am consuming it.  Here's the difference.  I am by myself.  Yes.  And there's nobody there to tether me to be like, hey, so I look at this stuff and whatever it is I am looking at that I am afraid because it depends who I am and what I resonate with.  Is it, am I afraid of people crossing the border?  Am I afraid of school shootings?  Am I afraid of this other group?  Right?  It's just what, and everything is fear-based.  They are tapping into your fear and they make you afraid.  This other thing is going to harm me.  And there's no ability either.  I have noticed through social media, there's no middle ground.  It's either you are all the way over here and you are all the way over here.  And they feed on people's fears, these algorithms.  So this is a graph I found which shows the rise in- In school shootings.

But it's rising.  It's increasing.  One of the things to keep in mind with this, with the school shooting, and then we do not know this based on this one, is is it mass shootings or just shootings in general?  So school shooting is, I show up to school, I do not like you, Steven.  I pull out my gun, I shoot you.  Technically, that's a school shooting.  A mass shooting is like what we saw the week before, Minneapolis, and we had that person who showed up to school and he just started shooting randomly.  So there's two.  So when we look at shootings, let's look at mass.  Let's look at mass.  Because if you look at school shootings, one-on-one, those are a bit different and they have to do with the city.

But if you look at mass shootings, what can we tell for mass shootings?  So some of the data shows us, typically, that person tends to have some kind of association to the place they go to, the school they went to.  Typically, there's some type of connection.  Usually, at that point where they commit to shooting, something in their life happened, right?  There's some type of moment, maybe they broke up with a partner, they lost their job.  Something that offset that moment.

Now, over time, historically, they were building up to having all these issues.  Those issues do not go away.

But something typically happens where they decide, I am going to do this.  The other thing is they are planned.  So they either, they sit down and decide to plan this out and they communicate it to somebody in some way or they do it through social media.

Another thing that's really interesting, they happen typically in the mornings.  They typically happen in the mornings.  That person wakes up and says, okay, today's the day I am going to do it.  I have got my plan in place.  And they execute it earlier on in the day.  The other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, the other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, the other thing with mass shootings, mass shootings, not just regular school shootings, in almost all of them, if dare I say all of them, all those individuals had a history of mental health issues or mental illness.  The other thing too that we see is they had access to weapons.  So they were either able to go get a weapon, they knew somebody who had a weapon and they were able to get that weapon.  One of the things you said a second ago about how this might become more frequent sadly had me thinking about why that would be and what's changed in the world.  And one of the things that has changed in the world is that media is now increasingly people.  People like us that have microphones in our kitchens.  I mean, we are sat in what used to be my kitchen recording this conversation.  And once upon a time to reach this many people, you had to be CNN.  CNN's a logo.  It's hard to shoot at, but in a world where much of the media is like creator-led or host-led media, it's much easier to have a target.  And that just made me think about it.  I was like, oh yes, of course.  Of course, you know.

But sometimes to the target, if you are looking at mass shootings, now, if you are looking at a target, like this Charlie Kirk thing we were talking about, right?  Sometimes it's done because they want notoriety.  It's a big thing.  So with this specific shooting, Charlie Kirk, it's come out now that the individual was actually on Discord after he did the shot, talking about it with other members on Discord, according to what law enforcement said.  Again, I am just updating as I know it, it could change.

But he was saying, he was basically talking with other people and basically saying like he did it and laughing about it.  He was admitting to doing it.  Yes, they were like, we think you did this.  He's like, oh, maybe I did it.  Ha ha ha ha.  So there's, it's become for whatever reason in that world, it's seen as a, that is an acceptable thing to do.  A way to create significance in a otherwise.  Yes, I want attention.

I want to create significance.  And also here's the other thing.  What's happening is we are villainizing people very easily.  We are calling people names.  We are villainizing them.  And it goes back to social media, clips people are making.  Even things that are, our words are our most powerful weapon.  And we do not realize that when you open your mouth and you say something and it's, what's happening is people are not saying something because most people are cowards.  They text it and they post it because they would never say it to your face and they post it.  And then what that does is all these, these negative things, these, these attacks we make towards people become commonplace.  So if all I see is negative stuff, this guy's bad.  This guy's this, this guy's that, I start to think it's true.  And if you villainize somebody to such a degree, I think, well, I am going to be a hero if I do something about this.  Look what a horrible person this is.  I heard this quote once, the bigger, the hero, the better.  The bigger the villain.  I have to make you such a villain so I can feel like a hero.  And this is what happens.  When you villainize people to such a degree, you create a justification.  I had to do this.  Look at how horrible this human being was.  Look at all the horrible things people are saying about them.  I am doing the right thing.  You just justified it and sold it to yourself.  It's the right thing to do.

But today with social media, I cannot solely blame them because social media posts and the things people are creating and putting out there is giving justification to other people to do this stuff.  Did you say that your husband was a sniper?  He was counter assault.  So you and him are both former secret service agents.  Correct.  So when you see something like the Charlie Kirk assassination happen, I am so curious as to the conversations in your house about that, because you must be looking at this from so many different perspectives, from like how that person could have been killed, how that person could have been more protected, I guess, or how that setup could have been to mitigate the chances of something like that happening.  So with Charlie Kirk, there's nothing they could have done, let alone put snipers on the rooftop to prevent that, or counter snipers rather.  Is that what they would have had to do?  That's what they would have had to do.  Okay.  And there's no way anybody would have done it.  That's what I said.  Like if you are a president or person of Congress or some VIP like that, you are going to get those assets.  A person like Charlie Kirk, like you or me, we are not going to get those.  Who's going to pay for that?  So he had security, but it was on the ground with him.  Their thinking, their type of security thinking, and this is private security, and again, it's not to knock them because this is something new.  This is new.  They are thinking, I need to protect Charlie from the guy standing at the podium asking a question, all these people pushing up against the rope line who want to talk to Charlie.  So they are looking at it from this physical sense.  It's like, it sounds terrible, but it's almost like a meat shield.  I am the meat shield between you and them.  They are not thinking, I am going to protect Charlie from the ground problems.  Nobody thought, who would have thought, maybe a Secret Service agent would have, but who would have thought I need to have snipers on the rooftops or counter snipers on the rooftops to protect from a sniper shooting Charlie Kirk?  He was wearing a bulletproof vest, was not he?  That's what I have been told.  I am not sure.  I do not know if it's 100% true, so I do not want to say yes or no.  I say that because in several of the videos when he's on campus, you see that there's clearly, when he's wearing a T-shirt, you see vest marks here.  I noticed this many weeks, many, many weeks ago.  It might be true.  Yes.  Just because it's never confirmed, I am hesitant, so I do not know.  It's very possible.  And again, it's not a, so a vest like that, it's going to stop a round from a pistol typically and maybe a shotgun round.  Rifle rounds usually, like our counter assault teams in the Secret Service, they actually had an extra ceramic plate to help prevent those.  So you really need like a different type of exposure to protect from a rifle round.  So in this scenario with him, the shot, you see it go straight to his neck.  And that's the thing with vests.  They protect you here, right?  They protect your vital organs.  And even when I would wear mine, it was, you lived in the reality of, if I get one to the head, I am done.  Is that your worst nightmare as a Secret Service agent, that something like that happens to the person you are protecting?  Correct.  It is the worst, because it means you failed.  It's horrible.  It's horrible.  I mean, when you would do protection stuff and the person you are protecting, whoever it was, who would protect.  I have protected everybody from the President of the United States to former presidents, to first ladies, to their kids.  I had Barbara Pierce Bush, who which was President Bush's daughter.  I had her for a while.  To the Secretary of Treasury, to the Secretary of Homeland Security.  These are all USS protectees and foreign heads of state.  When the Prime Minister of the UK comes to the United States, he gets protection.  We work with the team, because you do not want anybody getting assassinated on US soil.  So you protect Russia when he comes, Putin.  You got to take a bullet for him too.  So it's more the mission.

So, but the thing is, it's your responsibility.  And so the whole time, I do not want to say you are on edge, but the whole time you are on, you are aware, your mind's moving.  Where's my threat?  Where's my threat?  Where's my threat?  Where's my problem?  And then we would have, sometimes they would have what they call like wheels up parties, which means your protectee is up, their wheels up in the plane.  And that's when people were just like, because the stress is so high, you are so on.  You are always looking at the threat.  There's no, we work in shifts, but there's days where I work 16, 17 hour days, 18 hour days, depending on what my assignment was.  It's a lot.  What is the most important thing for the person who clicks on this podcast, because they are looking for something in their life.  They want to be more effective in the pursuit of their goals, whatever their goals might be.  It could be professionally, personally, could be, you know, maybe they want to be an entrepreneur or something.  What is the most important thing?  And what is the most important thing that we should have talked about in that regard that we did not talk about, Aviv?  I do not know what to say to that.  I guess what I would say to them is, I think the message is that they are extremely capable.  And no matter what society is telling, no matter what's happened to them, no matter what excuses people make for them, or maybe they make for themselves, they are much more capable.  And so that maybe when they see someone like you or myself, and they think, oh, look, they have got it all figured out.  It's like, we figured it out the same way everybody else figured it out.  So I think Steven, the most important thing is like, we are not that special.  And that means that they can do and achieve what they want.  I think that's the biggest thing.  Like you are absolutely capable.  Even if you feel inadequate, even if you lack confidence, even if you have had horrible trauma in your life, whatever it is, despite all that, you are absolutely capable and it is your choice.  Evy, we have a closing tradition on this podcast where the last guest leaves a question for the next guest.  Not knowing who they are leaving it for.  And the question left for you is, what brings you the most joy in life?  And what are you the most scared of?  The most joy in life is my daughter.  I think the biggest joy in my life is her, because I think that was something I always wanted to do and to be a mom.  And so that's the biggest joy.  And then at the same time, it's my biggest fear, because I want her to be well and healthy and okay.  And I think a consequence of the work I did, and even still do because I am in media and news and I cover crime, I have seen what humanity can do.  I have seen the good in humanity, but I also have seen the bad things people can do.  And so it's hard sometimes.  You want to protect your child, but I also know that I cannot always shield her.  I will not be able to shield her in life from everything.  That's scary.  That's scary.  Thank you, Evy.  I was saying to you before we started recording that everywhere I go, people come up to me and they talk about you in a way that's atypical.  So like, you know, obviously I do a lot of episodes, meet a lot of great people.  Is that really true?  I swear I am, I do not want to swear I am at anyone's life, because that's, I probably should not do that.

But I swear to you, the amount of times I have used you as a case study for, what do I use you as a case study for?  For how important it is, how important it is to me what effective communication is.  Because people come up to me all the time and mention you.  So obviously I then do that.  I am like, why are people always mentioning Evy?  Like, I get it, you know, you are very, very successful.  You have lived this incredible career, but obviously I speak to lots of people that are successful.  That's what I am saying.

But why are they always coming up to me and talking about you and asking me to speak to you again, et cetera?  I think it's all the things you said.  I think you meet them where they are.  And I think you do that in both your communication style.  I think the nuance of your, you know, of your message is spot on while also being high conviction in certain areas.  And you are relatable.  They think you are a badass.  And I guess that's it.  It's something you learn from doing these podcasts.  You just have certain people who people just, they just click with that people on the show.  And even as the host, you cannot, in hindsight, you are trying to figure it out.

But there's something.  And in much of the questions that I asked you today, we are orientated towards finding out what that something is.

But listen, a lot of it exists in your book as well.  You talk so eloquently and so excessively in this book, Bulletproof, about the nature of the human condition and what we need to understand about the human condition to be more effective in our lives and our relationships and our work.  So I highly recommend everybody goes and checks out this incredible book, Becoming Bulletproof, Life Lessons from a Secret Service Agent.  Incredible.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate you, Stephen.

Because people love playing these with colleagues at work, with friends at home, and also with family.  And we have also got a big audience that use them as journal prompts.  Every single time a guest comes on the Diary of a CEO, they leave a question for the next guest in the diary.  And I have sat here with some of the most incredible people in the world, and they have left all of these questions in the diary.  And I have ranked them from one to three in terms of the depth.  One being a starter question.  And the other being a question of the next guest.  And level three, if you look on the back here, this is a level three, becomes a much deeper question that builds even more connection.
