Money is one of the biggest pain points for people.  They have stories from their past that created wounds and traumas and limiting beliefs that then dictate their behaviors.  My money story was tied to stress and chaos because my parents frequently, they were stressed out, screaming at each other, slamming doors, and it just seemed to tie into a sense of lack.  Most people want to make easy money, but they do not know how to make money easy.  And my vision was to go and interview some of the world's most financially successful individuals who also have inner peace and abundance around money and also understand the dynamics of trauma around money, the wounds around money, our belief system around money.  You got to heal the money story to create a new belief system for yourself that something is possible.  Lewis Howes is a New York Times bestselling author, keynote speaker, and host of one of the biggest podcasts in the world with over a billion downloads, The School of Greatness.  Lewis is a former two-sport All-American athlete and former professional football player.  And now he's focused on teaching people to transform their relationship with money.  Struggles with our finances have a huge impact on our mental health, our physical health, our relationships, the list goes on and on.  And in fact, I pulled this up because I knew you were coming in here.  A study cited in the Journal of Family and Economic Issues found that financial worries are a leading cause of psychological distress.  And I am going to talk about that in a minute.

But I am going to talk about the psychological distress in our society today, which you already know.  A meta-analysis, and this was published just in 2022 in PLOS One, determined that financial stress and depression are intimately linked.  All right, so this is something that is impacting our lives, whether we understand it, whether we realize it, whether we like it or not.  And yet we are not educated about this.  And so I am curious what inspired you to make this, your topic of focus, with all the things that you have done, and what inspired you to make this your topic of focus, with all the things that you have done, and what inspired you to make this your topic of focus, to have expertise in.  This is something very unique.  Why did you choose to get people educated on this?  My whole vision and mission is to help people heal and create wholeness within them.  And as I went on my own healing journey of healing relationships, but also just my traumas as a child, I realized that was causing me to act out in certain ways based on these wounds, based on the story that I had from my past.  It caused me to choose certain relationships I was in.  It caused me to be anxious in certain moments.  It caused me to be more reactive and defensive in certain moments.  And I realized, oh, okay, this story that I have, my history, shaped my belief system.  The things I saw, my environment, my experiences, the things I did to other people, the things other people did to me, it shaped a belief.  And those beliefs shaped my behaviors.  When I was triggered, when I was excited, I would behave in a certain way.  And those behaviors created my outcome, my results.

But more importantly, the feelings I had based on the results was something I always wanted to understand.  Because as an athlete, I think you can relate to this, when I would accomplish my goals, I was very goal-oriented and I would accomplish them, but I would not feel good afterwards.  So I was always like, why am I not happy with the results I am creating, even though these are massive dreams that I have?  And then I started to realize how to heal past wounds that were causing me to be driven, these behaviors, to drive me to achieve without feeling fulfilled.  And I started to learn how to heal so I could be fulfilled in the journey and in the success that I would have, or the failures that I would have.  And just like you said, I am glad you shared these stats, money is one of the biggest pain points for people.  And my goal is to bring people healing and create wholeness within them.  And yes, we want to live extraordinary lives.  We want to be healthier in all these different facets of life.  We want to have beautiful relationships.  We want to have a healthy relationship.

But I just noticed after the last 12 years of doing all the content I do, a pillar of my content is around money.  And there was just so much pain and confusion around understanding the relationship to money.  Most people want to make easy money, but they do not know how to make money easy.  Most people, money is hard for them.  It's stressful.  It's, they do not even want to pay attention to it because they do not understand it.  They have stories from their past that created wounds and traumas.  And limiting beliefs that then dictate their behaviors and influence their behavior around money in their life.  If you ask people how much money they have in their bank account, they probably have no clue.  If you ask them how much debt do you have, they might have at a ballpark, but they really do not know.  Most people are avoidant and they do not have a healthy relationship with it.  And my vision in part of this book in this process was to go and interview some of the world's most financially successful individuals who also have inner peace and abundance around money.  Money.  And also understand the dynamics of trauma around money, the wounds around money, our belief system around money.  And when we have an environment where our nervous system is reactive or anxious or scarce around money, it's typically going to dictate our environment externally with money as well.  When we receive it, when we spend it, how we feel.  And I noticed this with most of my life.  I got really good at making money at a certain point after years of struggling, being broke, living on my sister's couch for a while, not thinking I would ever make money.  Then I obsessed about it and I hoarded it and I saved it and I would not spend it on anything for years.  And I noticed, okay, I am making money, I am getting the success, but I still do not feel good with money.  Even a year and a half ago, as I was finishing this book and doing my own research, I had some big wounds.  I had some big wounds that came up where there was a company that owed me about a million dollars and the old wounded part of me as a child that had money stolen from me at one point came up and I saw this reaction and this scarcity and this stress and this anxiety that kind of put me in a lower energetic state for a few months.  And I was like, how perfect is this that I have not finished this book yet, writing it, but this is showing up for me.  A big wound.  And it was a beautiful blessing because I was like, it's teaching me a lesson on what I still need to improve on and how I can still grow around my own money story and create more peace.  And I think the whole goal of this book and this conversation for your audience would be to show people how to create peace, harmony and abundance around money in their life, how to define what a rich life looks like for them.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.  Erasmus Prager.  Yes.  I did not write the book.  I came up with it a long time ago.  Huh.  I wrote hazard leg.  Yes.  I came to America inosing, not a long time ago, which is pretty awkward.  Right.  And we look uber viral to many people, right?  Right.  Americaция.  It's one of those countries where I was paid if we are Bible.  Yes.  So we think it's the same thing.  It's similar to what we did in a wider future.

But that simple allowances, that multiplication, that Ribeir.  So you have to think through a lot.  Yes.  How is that relationship for you?  So I will give an example.  And I am going to ask you to share this in a second.  I asked, I asked a family member of mine, a relative of mine.  If money walked into a, you know, a restaurant, and you were in the restaurant and money walked in through the door, what would you do if it was a person if money was represented into a person?  And this, this person was in their late 20s in their late 20s.  And they said, I would run to the bar and avoid this person.  If it was money, I would talk bad about it behind its back.  I would.

But then I would fake and act like I liked it when it came up to me.  Then I would use and abuse it when I needed it.  And I would ghost it if it ever reached out to me.  And I go, man, that seems like a really unhealthy relationship with money.  And they were like, yes, I know.  And their environment, their experience.  This around money has also replicated that, that connection, that feeling that relationship.  And it's, it does not mean something's good or bad, right or wrong.

But it's asking ourselves, do we have a healthy relationship with money?  Is it causing more pain in our relationships, intimately in our environment?  And if it is causing pain, how do we create a different relationship?  So Sean, if if money walked in the door as a person, how would you respond?  The first thing that I would feel.  When you just pitched that and I could see it, I would feel grateful to see money.  And I would speak to money and I would make sure that money was not there to like somebody else needed them more.  I did not want to be greedy with their time and attention.

But also I am open and welcome.  And I know that money knows me well.

And so, you know, it would just be a vibe.  It would be a good vibe.  Yes, exactly.  And that's good.  So you probably have a good relationship with money because that's how the experience is.  So it probably means like when, when someone's in a relationship, they are like, Oh, I am going to be a good person.  And when someone gives you a check or you receive money, you have a good feeling.  It probably also means when you are spending money to invest in something or you are going on a trip, you are not stressed and anxious about it.  Like, Oh, I am spending this money.  I have to really penny pinch everything.  You know, maybe you are not extravagant spending everywhere constantly, but you have a good relationship and a good balance with it, which is healthy and a secure relationship.  And most people do not have a secure relationship with it.  And I think that's, that's really what I am trying to do is give people the tools and the knowledge.  I am trying to understand their money story to see how their personality style matches with their wounds or their traumas around money.  And just see, is that serving you in your life?  Do you have a rich life because of the story and the style that you have developed over time?  If not, how do we start rewiring you emotionally in your nervous system to feel safe with money when it comes to you, when it leaves you?  You know, there's a mantra I have that it's the more I relax, the more I can receive when I am tight, when I am clinched, when I am anxious, when I am stressed out, it's hard to receive love, affection, money opportunities.  It's hard to see the opportunities we are in that fight and flight mode, right?

But the more I relax, the more I can see and I can receive and I can be generous and I can, and all these things can happen.  And I just see so many people struggling with money and I am, I am in no way some money guru.  I do not know the best place to invest your money.  I do not know where you should be doing these things.  I have my strategies that make me feel good.  This is more about understanding your story and your belief system around it and how to heal that.  So you have a beautiful relationship and a rich and abundant life.  Yes.  And this is something you talk about in the book, but you are one of my money mentors, you know, it's because I can relate to you.  You know, you come from similar circumstances, similar part of the globe and also coming from such a dire circumstance as well.  And you even unpacked it even more.  And like, it's something.  It's like, I had to take a moment reading your book and also just coming back from your wedding, of course, I am just feeling a lot of emotions around you.

And so, you know, you getting injured, you know, working, living your dream really as an athlete.  And of course, you know, you were working towards something and that injury that took you off the field.  And you know, at that point you are still able to depend on your dad.  Yup.  And your dad was in a devastating car accident not too long after that.  And so being faced with this new.  Magnified problem.  Like I guess I do not have my dad to depend on either.  So what am I going to do?  And so like everything was just being taken away from you and also taken away from your dad.  And just that story really hit my heart as well.

But just the things that you went through and for you to progressively overcome things, but then you can develop some different, you know, you talk about the shadow side of these styles and we are going to talk about all this stuff, but you were able to achieve many different levels of success, but ultimately define fulfillment.  And this is, this is something I did not mention about this.

Let me share this with you.  So in that study from plus one, determining that financial stress and depression are linked.  They also found a positive, of course, a positive association between financial stress and depression in high income and low, low to middle income areas.

But it was even stronger among people with low income or with wealth.  Yes.  So.  Both extremes.  Both extremes.

So, you know, the wealth is a more of a, of the, of the spectrum.  So wealthy tends to be more depression linked to it.  Is not that interesting?  Is not it because that, as you mentioned that fulfillment is not necessarily there and you can start to make strange decisions.  I mean, I got an interesting story around that.  I mean, it's like, imagine having everything and feeling like you have nothing and in everyone else's world, they say to you, you have all the money in the world.  You have all the success.  You are healthy.  How do you not see how good your life is?  So imagine hearing this from other people.  And knowing that you have everything, but inside of you, you feel worthless.  You feel undeserving.  You feel unloved and you feel like you have nothing.  That is a prison in my mind.  It sucks to be poor and know you have nothing, but to have everything and not appreciate it, man, that's really challenging.  And there's that's part of the study of the extreme.  And a few years ago I was living in an apartment building here in Los Angeles and I went on a road trip.  I came back and there was a tent in the valet.  And I was, I was pulling up.  I was like, I am going to go to the valet.  I am going to go to the valet.  I am going to go to the valet.  And I pulled up, there was a white tent.  I kind of made a joke to the valet attendant.  I go, someone did not jump today.  And he was like, yes, they did.  And I was like, this is a way.  This is a joke.  We are in one of the nicest buildings in Los Angeles, apartment buildings.  And are you serious?  Are you sure you are not joking?  And he was like, yes, it just happened like 30 minutes ago.  It was this shocking thing.  When I found out who it was, the person was worth hundreds of millions of dollars and jumped.

Now, this was the day after Father's Day.  And I do not plan to assume I know this person's life story, but in the news, it talked about he was estranged from his son, you know, and you could just start to go down and make an assumption of the story.  You can put the pieces together and you start hearing from other people that knew him.  You start hearing stories from people that worked in the building.  It was like, oh, here's a guy who seemingly had everything in terms of financial wealth, but did not live a rich life inside.  Yes.  And maybe that's part of the statistic of this extreme wealth linking to depression.  If you are unable to appreciate and love and accept yourself and have rich relationships, it might be even more painful having that wealth.  Yes.  You mentioned that money is a magnifier of who you are.  So many of us, we think that money is going to change us and our circumstances.  And, you know, and so what you really pointed out is that with building wealth, you are going to be able to do a lot of things.  You are going to be able to do a lot of things.  You are going to be able to do a lot of things.  You are going to be able to do a lot of things.  And we are in a relationship, not just with our food.  We are in a relationship with our food.  We are in a relationship with our food.  I think that's what you are talking about with this.  You know, when you are building wealth and making money easy, we want to not just, you are giving people those insights on how do we get to that place financially, but also to have the fulfillment in a rich life as well.  Yes.  And so a big part of this, and you have already mentioned this several times, you said the key word is a relationship.  And we are in relationship with everything.  Everything is a relationship.  We are in a relationship with our food.  We are in a relationship, obviously, we tend to think about it just in terms of people, with our, with our spiritual connection.  If we are reading a book, we are in a relationship with that thing.  And so starting to personalize it, I love that example of if money walked into the room and you hear the different spectrum of answers that I gave versus someone else.  Yes, you would be grateful, you would be generous.  Hey, how are you?  What do you need today?  Yes.  There's a.  I interviewed a guy who wrote a book called Happy Money, which is.  His name's Ken Honda out of Japan.  And.  I met him at Agape.  You did?  Yes.  That's a long time ago.  He's such a sweet guy.  He does all these kind of social experience with himself or he has over the years.  And one of them was, he did not have a good relationship with money at one point.  And he said, every time I see money, I am going to thank money.  I am just going to do this little simple practice inside that if I find a penny on the street, I am going to say, thank you.  If someone gives me a million dollars, I am going to say, thank you.  I am just going to say, thank you.  Whenever I get any type of payment that comes into my bank account, thank you.  Thank you.  Gratitude, gratitude.  And then he follows it up with saying, thank you money.  Where do you want to go?  Do you want to go in my bank account?  Do you want to go to an investment?  Do you want to buy a home with you?  Do you want to give you away?  Do you want to pay for someone's coffee?  Where do you want to go?  And he has this direct relationship and he's very intentional every time money comes, where it's going to go.  He gives it a direction.  He has this relationship with it and he's.  It's almost like he's talking to money as if it was a person, as if it was like a living being.  It was like this energetic being.  And.  And he's not worshiping money.  He just has a relationship with it that makes him feel emotionally safe and abundant.  And food is energy and so is money.  Money is energy, food is energy.  And when you eat things with a lower frequency within the food, it's going to affect your energy physically.  And you are going to have a relationship with that constant eating.  You are probably going to gain weight.  You might have inflammation.  You are going to get sick maybe at times.  Your immune system's going to be suppressed.  And on the opposite side, when you start eating healthier foods, you have a different relationship with that energy and you are nourishing yourself with that energy.  And I think we need to be thinking about money in that same nourishment attitude, that same reflection, that same relationship.  And you talk about the food side of things so much.  It's like having a relationship with your food.  I love the cookbook that you have where it's like sitting down with your family, talking, thanking food.  You know?  They pray over their food and there is this intention saying, thank you food for being here.  Thank you for people that made this food.  Thank you to whoever made it here preparing this food.  It's creating a ritual.  It's not worshiping food, but it's creating a beautiful relationship with it.  And I think again, our beliefs around food impact and influence our behaviors on what we are going to eat.  And that impacts everything.  And the same thing with our beliefs and behaviors around money.  You could have just changed everybody's life just now.  Getting that part, the same thing with our food and having gratitude and thanksgiving and blessing the food, blessing the people involved in it and having that relationship with money as well and not making it, it's not that you are worshiping money because of course that's that tenant that can make people repel money is the root of all evil.  It's the love of it, right?  Making that your God.  And we know some people make that mistake as well, but we are not talking about that.  We are talking about having a healthy relationship because here's a concept.  Eat that food.  Probably going to need some money.  You know what I mean?  Yes, exactly.  So it's all in relationship.  And so a big part of this relationship that we have in my perspective when money walked in the room, it's different from what it was 10 years ago, 20 years ago, 15, 25 years ago.  What was it like when you were broke in Ferguson, Missouri, struggling and your back was broken and you could not walk and you are not making money?  What was your relationship like with money then?  Man, if I could tune into that.  And you are eating fast food all day and you are sick.  And you are victim mindset.  To be honest, I probably would not even recognize money.  Money came in with a trench coat.  And you know what I mean?  Money would be like a Superman type.  Look like is that kind of.  Clark King's got glasses on, kind of look like.  I would not have even been able to recognize.  Really?  For sure.  For sure.  What if you would have known, okay, money.  Someone announces money is walking in the door right now.  And it says, here it is.  What would you have done in that moment?  What would your immediate relationship have been like?  I would have just stayed in my lane.  I would just stayed in my lane.  If money.  I mean, this is the thing.  And now that I am talking about this, and I love.  This is why I love talking with you too.  I would feel that money would notice me.  I would feel that money would notice me.  It would see you.  Yes.  Would notice me.  And not necessarily, again, come and talk and all that stuff, but I would see.  And maybe this is a prediction of my future, but I would not have been feeling like I deserved per se to be noticed, but I just would have felt like.  There's something about me that money would notice.  So that would be the extent of it.  It would have noticed you.  Maybe it would have spoken to you or not, but it would just said, oh, I see this person over there is struggling or.  Not necessarily struggling, but just like, I see you, listen.  Okay.  Like that.  And how would you have responded if money came up to you and said, hey, I see you.  I see your potential.  Whoa.  I would probably.  I am conflicted right now.  I would probably be like, part of it is like, it's about time.  The other part would be like, are you sure?  I do not think I am ready for this.  I do not think that I am worthy of this.  So this leads me to my point, which is our relationship with money is.  It's dependent upon our story and our story about ourselves, about our relationship with life, who we see ourselves as.  And so let's talk a little bit more about our story in regards to like our money blueprint.  Yes.  I mean, I will share you a couple of moments in my story.  When I was younger, and I think people could relate to some of this, and I would love for you to leave a comment if you are watching on YouTube, leave a comment of some of your money story memories below or somewhere on social media.  I do not know if you are on social media, so Shawn can see this.

But I have.  My money story was tied to stress and chaos.  Because my parents.  I do not like to use the word always, but frequently they were stressed out, screaming at each other, slamming doors.  And that just seemed to tie into a sense of lack.  We were middle class.

But I remember playing kind of roller hockey.  And the.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  We were in the neighborhood parking lot.  And I was the only one who had sneakers, not roller blades, because we could not afford it.  So it was like, okay, like I was playing with them, but I could not afford it.  You know, Nintendo was big.  I could not afford Nintendo.  So it's like I was not able to get those things.  So we had a home, we had food, all these things, but there was always stress around it, which just caused part of my story.  There was a time where I.  My brother went to prison, and there was a lot of money stress around that, paying for lawyers and just kind of going in debt, my parents.  Right?  So it was like this trauma tied to we did not have the money to pay for things plus my brother's in prison for selling drugs to an undercover cop.  And there was just kind of like trauma tied to money and pain.  During that time, I was not really allowed to have friends in the neighborhood growing up in a small town in Ohio, because everyone knew that my older brother was in jail.  So they did not want to hang out their kids with me.  And I remember there was a moment where these two kids started a club.  I do not know if you are ever in a club as a kid, these two kids started the club, like an after class club or whatever, in the basement of their house.  And I was like, I really want to be in this club was that I did not have friends.  They said, well, you need to answer a list of questions to get in to see if you are smart enough.  Or if not, you have to pay to be in the club.  And I was like, I do not have any money.  So what are the questions?  They asked me the questions.  I did not know the answers.  They are like, you cannot be in the club unless you pay us a $5 entry fee.  So I went home and I asked my mom, I said, Mom, I really want to get in this club and be friends with these kids.  Can I have $5?  And I could see the disappointment in her mind, not because she did not want me to be friends with them, or be a part of this club, but she did not have the money.  She goes, let me see what I can find.  She's literally asking me to flip over the cushions and the couches and just, you know, they would spent all their money on like legal fees.  And it was not like they had a lot.  Somehow she finds in an hour's time change and puts in a shoebox for me, $5 and change.  So I go to this house where these kids are, I give them the shoebox and they let me in their club.

But for the next hour, they are just hanging out with themselves.  And I am kind of alone in the corner in the basement.  Like, what am I doing?  It was the most like depressing, like even just thinking about it.  It's like a wound.  It's a story.  It's a memory that shaped my personality style.  It shaped me in a certain way.  And there's other stories like that.  I remember I never, I went home after where it was after that night.  And I never went back to that club because I did not feel good.  I did not feel worried.  I did not feel like I was going to be able to do anything.  I did not feel worthy still, even though I paid.  Right.  And there's certain stories like that.  I had money stolen from me.  I used to steal money a lot from people.  And it's like, it shaped me these wounds that I had to learn how to break.  And I had to learn how to heal.  And it just took time.  And I think whoever's watching or listening, like write in a story that you have that shaped your, your history and type in a money wound or two.  Like, can you remember something?  You do not have to share all the details, but something that happened that you still think about today that might have shaped part of your personality style with money.  And you said this, you were not ready for money.  One of my money mentors early on when I was broken my sister's couch, I was working for free for someone as an intern.  And my payment was I could ask him questions at any moment.  So every day we would go for lunch and I just ask him questions and he would teach me.  And one day I was like, man, I am broke.  I could really, really, really, really, really, really, really use some money.  And he said, money comes to you when you are ready for it.  And I was just like, I feel pretty ready for money right now.  Like I can use it.  I am on my sister's couch.  I do not have any money.  I feel helpless.  You know, I was 23, 24 at the time.  And I was just like, I do not feel like I am living up to my potential.  I do not, I cannot do anything with my life.  I do not have a car.  I just felt like a bum.  It was like, money will come to you when you are ready for it.  And as painful as it was to hear at that time, about a year and a half, two years later, I started to make some money.  And I remember reflecting back to that moment.  And I was like, if someone had handed me $5,000, I would have blown it because I was not ready for it.  I needed to learn certain skills on how to navigate money better.  And that's why you see a lot of people that the statistics with people that win a lot of money in the lottery, they go broke within a couple of years, they commit suicide, they go through depression, all these different things because they were not ready for it.  Some people maybe were and they got lucky.  You see this, with elite athletes who go bankrupt within a couple years after retiring from sports.  Maybe they are ready for the spotlight, but they are not ready to manage the money, the wealth that comes to them at 19 years old.  They do not have the energy, the emotion connected to it, and I really navigate it.  And all the different relationships that people want from you now.  Now that you have success, you have money, and everyone's asking for something from you.  It does not feel good.  It does not feel good if money walked in and you just said, give me money.  It does not like that relationship.  What are you going to provide for the money?  How are you going to serve money as well?  Where's the common thread in the relationship?  And so I really had to learn that like money comes to you more when you are ready for it.  And even when you are ready to make it, it does not mean you are going to have a healthy relationship with it.  I still was hoarding my money for the first eight years, because I was afraid to go back to my sister's couch.  I was afraid to go broke again.  So I was not really able to enjoy it.  Sure, I felt like I had safety and like a safety net.  If something happened and I could not make money, I had it saved.

But I was not living a rich life internally, because I was still living in fear around it.  And I think again, one of the biggest problems people have is when you make money and you start to make it, and you start to use your talents, your skills, and add value to something, and you start earning money, and you cannot appreciate it.  You cannot appreciate it.  You cannot be in peace still.  For me, that's a big problem.  Yes, yes.  And now to think of it, I am.  Thank you for sharing that story, man.  It pulls on my heartstrings.

But to think of the healing that you have gone through, the process, and the growth, and what just happened.  And I am going to bring this right to the spotlight.  Bring it up.  So you had a moment of essentially paying to have friends, right?  And not even having the resources really to even make that happen.  You just got married, surrounded by your friends just a couple of weeks ago.  And- yes.  The thing was all of us felt privileged to come and to be a part of that.  And we paid.  Yes, exactly.  Because it was in Mexico.  Yes, exactly.  I paid a lot too.

But yes, yes.  Of course.  No doubt.  No doubt about it.

But it's just like a full circle moment to where you do not have to try to advocate or to buy the affection of others.  It's like all of these people just love you because you are you.  And we are willing to, because of the person you are, do what we can on our part to be a part of your story.  Yes.  And it's appreciated.  And it's so interesting because as we were trying to plan this wedding, part of us were like, oh, should we do it in LA?  Should we do it in Mexico?  Where should we do this?  Should we have a big wedding, a small wedding?  Should we just do us two?  We are just talking about all these different things.  And I was like, I do not know why I do not want to do it in LA, because I do not want to feel like I am obligated to invite everyone.  Invite everyone who's in LA.  I was like, I would rather just invite a select few people.  And it does not mean I am not for you.  I am not for you.  And it does not mean I am not friends with more people that I would want to invite.

But I was like, let's only have a certain amount and only we can only invite a certain amount of people.  Then if we only want to have this many people, we only wanted a hundred.  I think there was like 120 and most of them was her family.  It's like an extended family.

But I was like, we are going to see a lot of like who our friends are.  If we go somewhere else to see who wants to actually pay to go.  Because anyone could show up in LA and just like drive down the street.

But like, let's, let's do it in LA.  Just like drive down the street.

But like, let's just see if people want to go.  And if no one comes like that's okay too.  Like we do not have to spend as much on the wedding, you know, it was like, we will see.  And it was beautiful.  I think like 98% of people like RSVP that we invited and the people that did not, they just had like a child or something recently or something else happened.

But, , it's beautiful to see when you create those scenarios.  And also it's beautiful to know that I did not need people to show up in that, in a sense, like I would have been, I would have loved myself and loved our marriage if it was just five of us in the family.  You know, it's like, I did not need all these people.  I did not need it.  And it was almost like, oh man, we kind of wish less people showed up, you know, in a sense.  I am glad everyone did, but it was not a, it was not a need.  And that's a big full circle moment for me.  It was like, I needed friends when I was like eight years old.  All I need is like, is to love myself and feel peace about myself and have a great relationship with Martha.  Yes.  I mean, I think that's, I think that's a really good point.  I think that's a really good point.  I think that's a really good point.  And I think that's a really good point.  And I think that's a really good point.  And my team in my community here, but I do not need lots of friends anymore.  And I do not need lots of money.  I want money to be able to use it for my mission, to be able to serve my mission, to have an expansive, rich, abundant life.

But it's not like I need and I crave it.  And so it's just shifting the relationship a little bit.  And it's a constant work in progress.  It's not like I have mastered this.  It's still learning, growing, developing, healing, it's a constant journey.  Yes.  Yes.  I did not share this with you, but I do not make a habit of going to weddings.  I do not like them either, man.  It's a lot.  It's because, it's because, and I am just going to share this with everybody.  It's because of the investment in the relationship.  I am voting for you.  I am investing in this and I do not know the parts, right?  Being able to spend time with you and with your wife over the years, even that magical moment of moments of, of being with your wife, even that magical moment of moments of how you guys met and connected.  And we spent hours talking.  Do you remember that in the hotel?  In Atlanta, right?  In Atlanta.  That was funny.  And you know, I had hit you up just like, hey, we are here, invited you to come out.  And then we just sat there, the restaurant was closed and just here.  I was literally, my jaw was on the floor and all these synchronicities of how you guys connected, and just to see that unfold over time and to see the commitment and the growth and all the things, just like, yes, like I am vote.  I am, I am casting my vote for this.  Yes, that's cool.  And also the sync, the synchronicities I knew were going to be plentiful, which was- At the wedding?  Yes, of course.  Of course.  Yes, that's great.  I share this with you that even when we got there, the people that came up to like, literally certain, a couple rushed up to us and just started talking to us, did not really know us like that, you know, not from the, you know, internet sphere, but just like somehow they were magnetized to us.  Huh.  Of course they ended up being seated at the table with us, you know, on the wedding day.  Like you, you guys already knew like who to seat together.  Of course.  Like we ended up spending time with the people that we ended up being seated.  Like you guys already knew.  We were very intentional about everything.  Like that's- Everything was very intentional.  Everything was very intentional in terms of seating people in the right place.  And we went over many times, like, who do we want to get to know each other and who's going to resonate with each other?  And I think, when you are intentional with your money, that relationship with money can grow.  Just like when you are intentional with your relationships, you know, you do a really great job with this.  I think this is one of my superpowers as well, is connecting people to help them accelerate their growth together.  Yes.  I was asking you before, like, who are some of the top episodes you had?  And you were like this, you know, dentist guy.  I was like, oh, I just went through this traumatic experience with my teeth for the last six years.  I would love to interview them.  And that's probably going to help a lot of people.  And so when you can, when you can invest in your relationships and, and seeing how you can serve people and add value, that relationship grows.  Yes.  When you can invest in your relationship with money and how you can be of service to your money to see it grow, it will continue to flourish, thrive, and create abundance for you.  And you do not know where the relation, you adding value in people's relationships in life will stem from.  I do not know what's going to happen with those synchronicities you had at my wedding.  The people you met that you knew that you did not know, maybe something happens, maybe something that never happens.

But you are going to have a memory and that memory is valuable.  It creates a moment inside of you that's abundant.  That's a beautiful experience.  It's, man, this thing happened.  I met this person.  It's just going to live inside of you.  And when you can plant those seeds in people, you are investing in relationships and the same is true with your money.  Yes.  Oh man.  All right.  So what I want to do is to dig in a little bit more on something that you, I took the quiz as well in the book and I was shocked.  What was your style?  My style was the director.  All right.  So I took the quiz and I am just like, I do not know about these questions.  I do not know.

But then once I read the detail on what the director is, it's like, oh, you just read me.  And I can also see, and I went through it and I thought about my wife and also her perspective, the choices that she would make.  And I could see how she's more one type.  And you also talk about like, what if you are two?  Yes, yes.

And so, yes.  We might have a mix of all of them.  It's just kind of what's your dominant type.  I think all of us do, but like, what is the dominant style?  What is she, the shepherd or the analyzer?  What was she?  She's more of the shepherd.  Yes.

But analyzer was the other one that was very close.  How did you freaking know, man?  Exactly.  I know her personality.  Talk about these money styles.  What is a money style?  A money style is really just kind of like your unique personality style towards money.  There's an amazing book called Attached.  I do not know if you have seen this book.  It's about a relationship book.  And supposedly there's kind of three styles.  There's three kind of personality styles that we have in a relationship.  Three kind of personality styles.  And some of us are anxious, some of us are avoidant, and some of us are secure in relationships.  Like you and your wife seem very secure.  Sometimes people get together and one person is anxious and one person is avoidant.  So there's a clingy person and the person that just wants to run away.  Or there's two people that are clingy, or there's two people that are avoiding each other, right?  And I was like, that's kind of interesting because usually when you have that similar personality style in a intimate relationship, you are going to have a lot of it might mirror and match your personality style towards your money relationship.  Because money is very intimate for a lot of people.  So I just wanted to go through that to see like, okay, if we could create a personality style and understand it by going through a quiz to see this assessment to see what is my personality style towards money, then it just gives us more power, more knowledge.  And there's some benefits.  And there's kind of these shadow styles as well towards your personality style.  Someone who's like, I guess, anxious in an intimate relationship, there might be some benefits of that.  Like they are always looking out for the person, they are always checking in on them, they are concerned about them.

But the shadow style might be like they are so clingy that they are never trusting them.  And it's trying to understand that towards your money.  And some people spend, spend, spend because they are wounded and they get a benefit.  They get a dopamine hit when they buy something every day.  They are shopping on the internet.  They are shopping on the internet.  They are buying something every day.  They are shopping on the internet.  They are buying something every day.  They are shopping online.  They are not secure with their money.  Or some people do not spend at all and they are stingy or they just hoard it.  I was that way for a long time because I was living in scarcity.  I was able to make money, but I still lived in scarcity because I was like, what if I lose it all?  So it created anxiety inside of my nervous system.  And so I just want people to have awareness on their story, their history around money, awareness around what personality style towards money is more their dominant go-to.  It does not mean it's like this all you are, it's four different styles.  And when you put those two together and you multiply it, you understand how your money strategy is.  And when you can start to see how you can shift these things, you can heal the past, you can shift your money style better and lead into the strengths of your style, then you can just start to make better decisions with your money.  And that's what I want people to do.  Feel emotionally, at peace and free with their money.  So they live an abundant life.  It's powerful, man.  You know what, what you are doing with this, with this relationship with money is you are bringing it right into our face, right?  Because this is happening, whether we like it or not, understand it or not, we are having a relationship with money, but so often, and you know this, like our culture, we are programmed in a way that, you know, we pick up these stories, right?  Your story is similar.  It's the majority of us have dysfunctional stories around money.  And we believe subconsciously is like, if we check all the boxes, then we can make money, right?  Like I go to school, go to college, get a good job, and then I am going to be financially successful.  And most people that follow that track are not just not successful monetarily, they are in debt.  Are successful.  Society is set up in a way that is encouraging people being in debt.  Yes.  And creating all this anxiety, creating dysfunctional relationships, furthering them, you know, and so one of the cool things about the book is that, and my favorite section is taking you to money therapy.  Yes.  All right.  So I thought we would go through some of those steps of going to money therapy.  Okay.  Okay.  All right, so step number one in taking yourself to money therapy is identifying your money triggers.  Yes.  One for me, and again, it may not ever leave you, right?  It's like healing is a journey.  And so your triggers might be a journey as well.  And the goal is to just notice them and ask yourself, okay, do I feel safe?  If not, let me create safety within my nervous system.  When I feel safe within my nervous system, then I can respond differently to these triggers.  So for me, when I felt like someone was taking advantage of me, it felt like abuse because I was sexually abused as well as a kid, talked about that on the show.  And so that could show up in any little thing.  If someone's cutting me off in a car, it's like, I could feel like I am being abused.  So there's little triggers where if I feel like someone's trying to overcharge for something, I am like, huh, they are trying to take advantage of me.  It's like unfair.  Yes.  And I could feel like this trigger.  Connected to that wound.  Exactly.

And so, you know, I am not really as reactive now as I used to be, but those could still be triggers that could show up if I am not doing the practices.  If I am not continuing to be on the healing journey with money therapy.  And so that's just something for me.  Yes.  Yes.  So that's something, again, as we are going through.  And by the way, of course, get the book like yesterday.

But being able to identify what your triggers are, your money triggers.  When some big announcement comes out about me and people see it, and then I see people reach out to me, and I know they have not reached out to me for years.  And they reach out to me, and it's almost like there's this feeling that they are about to ask for something.  And then within like a few weeks, they say, hey, can you help me with this?  Or can you help me with this?  It may be innocent, but I also feel like, huh, they have not been investing in the relationship for years.  And all of a sudden, they want something from me, because they see me doing something well.  That can be a trigger where I feel taken advantage of.  And I am like, oh, they want me for my success or my money, or they are going to ask for money.  So it's just learning to be OK and feel safe within myself around these things.  And also, I do not have to give everything to everyone.  I can create boundaries, healthy boundaries, but just not feel as triggered about it.  Do you have any money triggers?  So one thing that pops up for me is something that I have healed from, but it was relative.  It was a couple of years ago still.  It still bothers me.  And that was being seen or taken advantage of by people close to me when it comes to money and having a relationship built on that.  Right?  Right?  And I was in a condition where there's a lot of, obviously, we were in poverty.  We were getting money, food stamps.  And there are times you get food from charities and things like that.  And so there were a lot of stories around money, like these sayings that my mom would say I still hear to this day.  What are those sayings?  I am broke as a joke.  Oh, man.  There's one which is wildly inappropriate.  She would say, I am broke as a broke dog.  Wow.  Please bleep that.  Why?  Why, mom?  Why, mom?

But she would just say these wild things when it comes to money.  You know, like, do I look like I am made of money?  You know, this kind of stuff.  Has your mom ever been financially free?  No.  On her own?  Yes, she's been on her own.  And that was a journey.  How many has she been financially free now?  Or she's like?  She's doing stuff.  She's created her own life.

But I do a lot for her.  She has not created her own wealth, necessarily.  Yes.  And this brings me to the trigger, which is there was a time when, you know, I was in a relationship with a guy.  And I was like, I am going to be a lawyer.  I am going to be a lawyer.  I am going to be a lawyer.  And there was a time when my mother, when I was like, stuff was very sketchy for me.  And I was basically getting a refund check from my college scholarship and grants.  And I would get maybe like $2,000 back.  And I would use that to pay my rent.  My mom asked to borrow some money.  And I was like, mom, listen, I got to pay.  So make sure.  Please give it.  She was like, I just take care of it.  She said she would pay you back.  She ghosted me.  Oh, man.  I have had that.  That's what happened to me so many times.  My mom, my old mom.  Oh, that's a wound.  Right?  That's a money trauma.  And again, now here's the thing.  Me then was so hurt that my mom would allow me to get kicked out on the street.  And I remember calling her.  I called her from a different number.  It's how she picked up.  Because you know, you got to call her ID.  And I am like, where are you?  And she, you know, she made up a story, which is something typical.  Of course.  And at the time I felt so brokenhearted.  Now because of, again, healing and taking responsibility.  Obviously she was just trying to survive.  She was trying to do what she felt she needed to do.  It's not that she hated me.  Does not make it right though.  It does not make it right at all.  It obviously, she does not want to hurt her son, but it's just the situation that she was in.  Yes.  And so I stopped.  The trigger would be her asking me for things.  And over time still, I would loan her, like give her, right?  Because I did not have my stuff together.

But then once I got to a place of more certainty and stability for myself, I was just like, just take it.  Whatever you need.  Do not give it.  Right.  I do not want it back.  Because she would even say that still.  It took like, it took a long time for her to stop saying, I will give it back.  I am just like, mom, please no.  This is just, I am your son.  I love you.  I want you to be well.  That's good.  You know?  And so I freed myself of that trigger of being asked for something and then being chemically and emotionally dependent on them coming through for me.  Not being let down or disappointed.  Right.  It sounds like you have gotten to a place where you have created a money agreement with yourself that you say, I am going to give a certain amount to my mom.  At certain times that I feel good about.  And she does not have to pay me back.  It's what it sounds like.  You create a new agreement by going to money therapy.  And when we do not have these agreements in place, when someone breaks our agreement, when they lie to us, they say, I need money.  I will pay you back.  And they do not.  They have broken your heart because they have broken an agreement.  And it's sad.  And that's been a trigger of mine for many times, many times, loaning out money, giving money to people and then not paying it back when they said they would do it.  And feeling really like, how could you not do this?  And being so emotionally hurt by it, that creates a money trauma, a money wounds that we need to learn how to heal.  And you can do that by taking your power back and also creating new agreement with yourself, having the boundaries around money.  Okay.  If my mom asked for money, you know, do I feel good giving it to her knowing that she's not going to pay it back?  If you do not feel good, maybe you do not give it right now.  Or maybe you give less, or maybe you ask yourself where you are at in your life.  Okay.  If you would give some, cool, you give some.  It all has to depend on where you are coming from.  So yes.  Well, you know, a big part of that was an act.  And I am just now talking with you, it comes up for me.  That ended a couple years ago when I decided to do something for her proactively without any expectation.  And this was a change in our relationship.  When I was a kid, I told her that when I grow up, I am going to get you a Cadillac.  Right?  And it's just something that I wanted to do for my mom.  It was always there in my mental Rolodex, you know, my memory bank.  And so I did that.  A couple years ago you did?  Yes.  Wow.  How did that feel?  It felt amazing.  You know, it felt like I fulfilled a promise.  Wow.  And when I did that, it was like, it was, there was no expectation.  There was no expectation.  I am doing this for my mom because I said I want, and I wanted to, and it brought a sense of like completion for me as well.  And so the relationship was different after that.  There was no more expecting her to do certain things or be a certain way just because she's my mom.  It's just.  She was still acting the same way.  She was still asked for money every few months.  She was still being herself.  Yes.

But your relationship shifted inside of you.  As a matter of fact, she asked for me to help her fix her car.  The one that you bought her?  No, no.  A different one?  A different car.  And instead of that, I got her a new one.  Oh, that's pretty baller.  Yes.  Wow.  Yes.  I mean, listen, it was not a brand new off the floor with all the, you know what I am saying, the screens and the automatic start.  You know what I am saying?  It was, it was.  It was not a junker though.  No.  Yes.

But your relationship shifted within you with her.  Yes.  Right.  And she kept being the same.  She did not change, but you shifted.  Yes.  And it helped heal you.  Yes.  That's powerful.  Yes.  That's really powerful.  So let's move to number two here.  So number one, identify your money triggers.  Number two is to write it down.  Yes.  I just think it's powerful to like identify within your mind and think about these stories, but then write down a kind of a list of these triggers, these wounds, these things.  So you can have them in the forefront and start to address them one by one, start to process them.  Start to see what acts can I take that will support me in overcoming these things that cause me anxiety in my nervous system when I think about it, or cause me these triggers.  Just having the awareness, writing it down is a powerful act.  Yes.  Yes.  I love that.  I love that.  It's bringing it, it's just again, getting it out of your head.  Getting it out, man.  And, and speaking it, whether it's speaking it out, which goes to this next one, talk to a safe person.  Yes.  Do not talk to someone who's caused the trigger or the trauma necessarily right away.  Talk to someone that you trust.  A mentor, a friend, a therapist, a coach, a priest, whatever it might be that you feel safe with to address these things.  It's going to give you so much more peace just speaking about it with someone that's trustworthy who can listen.  Not someone who caused the trauma that you want to like scold them.  You know, maybe there's another time for that where you can come to peace with them if that's possible, but getting it out, thinking about it, writing it down, speaking it out.  Yes.  And again, this is a process.  This is taking yourself to money therapy.  Yes.  And if you are going to be able to get that money triggers, write it down, talk to a safe person.  The next one, number four is to forgive yourself and others.  Man, I do not know about you, but I held onto so much resentment towards myself about stealing as a kid for about a year and a half.  I stole every time I went into a store from like 10 and a half to like 11 and a half, 12.  It was like every time it was like a game and it was trying to get attention because I did not feel like I was, I had no friends.  I had no validation.  I had wounds and it was trying to be seen.  You know, I did not think anyone was seeing me and it gave me a sense of power by being able to steal.  And it was like candy bars or like, it was not like a ton, but it was still, I was living out of integrity every single day.  I went to a store to try to feel powerful because I felt powerless.  And in return, I heard a lot of people, you know, I heard these store owners, I might have heard an employees who were counting.  I heard they were counting inventory and they had missing inventory, whatever it might have been, I caused pain on other people.  And for years I would beat myself up and I was like, God, I was such an idiot.  How could I do this?  I was so stupid.  What was I thinking?  And sure, I should have a consequence to that, but holding onto that pain and resentment of myself for decades did not serve me.  And again, there's a, there's a, there's a, it's a good part of the consequence of like, knowing this part of me when I had money, I just wanted to pay for everyone all the time.  I was like, I just want to pay it forward.  I am going to buy everyone's meal.  I am going to pay for everything, whatever it might be.  Cause I felt guilty.  Right?  So there was maybe some good side to it also, but then I just felt shameful as well.  And that shame does not create anything abundant.  That energy of shame is very low frequency energy.  It does not create abundance.  And so that I have lived in scarcity.  And it was not until I started to forgive myself.  I started to forgive myself.  I started to forgive myself for all the things I did when I was 10, 11, 12, whatever, stealing and hurting people in that way.  Then I was able to be more at peace.  And again, my intention is to give people the tools to feel financially free.  It does not mean you are going to have millions of dollars in the bank, but you will hopefully be peaceful and harmonious around the money you have or do not have because you have cultivated that within you.  And that takes healing, forgiveness, letting go of self-criticism.

But what you used to do now that we have awareness, we can make different decisions.  And when we feel abundant versus scarce, we can live the most powerful habit within the seven habits in the book, which is the mindset habit, which is to be generous and grateful and continue all the time.  Like you said, if money walked in the door, you would be grateful.  You say, thank you for being here.  And most people say.  I give when I have money, but we need to flip that on its head and say, this is the first habit that I need to have to create a rich and abundant life is to be grateful and give generously.  Even if you do not have money, you can think about ways you can give of your time, of your energy, of your love, of your curiosity, of your presence, of your connection, of your connecting people together for them to flourish.  You can think in other ways on how can I serve and give generously.  And when I was 23, 24, 25, living on my sister's couch, broke as a joke what your mom would say, had no money, living in college debt, living off my sister's food and feeling worthless, feeling undeserving and unworthy.  I had to shift out of that by saying, what can I give?  I did not know because I did not have a college degree yet and I did not think I had skills to contribute to anyone.

But what I did have was power.  I had the power.  I had the power.  I had the power.  I had the power.  I had the power.  I had the power.  I had the passion.  I had like hunger.  I had a curiosity.  I was able to be consistent with my goals and follow up and do whatever it took.  And little did I know, Sean, that I would make a, you know, a multimillion dollar business off of asking questions and being curious.  Like one of my skills was asking dumb questions to people and just being like, how do you do this?  And well, how would you do this?  And what about this moment?  I never thought that was an asset.

But we all have these invisible assets within us that when we can cultivate and give them generously, we can live a rich and abundant life.  Yes.  That's so powerful.  I love the framing on that.  You know, what people would think, why are you asking dumb questions?  I know, right?  No, you literally built, not only that, did you, did you build this success for yourself, but you have impacted the lives of so many millions of people, so many.  And it's just like, you have paid it forward immensely in ways you do not even realize, you know, because of that audacity.  You know, and it was kind of, this is the cool thing.  It was built into you already.  And that's where you are directing people to with Make Money Easy, which is directing them inward because we all have a personal relationship and to be more aware of it.  And so I want to take you to number five here on this list.  After Forgive Yourself and Others, again, we are taking ourselves to money therapy.  Yes.  Number five is to practice overcoming your triggers.  So this is practice.  That's it, man.  When someone cuts you off.  You talking about practice?  What's that?  Practice.  We are talking about playoffs.  When, you know, I used to get triggered a lot in LA when I first came out here because of being stuck in traffic.  I just did not like it.  And I literally felt like people were trying to hurt me and abuse me when they would cut me off.  And I remember this is, you know, I do not feel good saying this, but I remember there was a guy I pulled up.  I do not know if I have told you this story.  I was in West Hollywood.  I was driving my Cadillac that from, that I bought from my money mentor that you met three weeks ago.  My, my wedding, Stuart Jenkins, who you are sitting next to.  I bought his Cadillac for $5,000 from him when I moved to Los Angeles 13 years ago.  And it was a $5,000 Caddy used car was a 1997, , Cadillac Eldorado Berets.  Beautiful, you know, old grandpa car, but it was amazing for me.  And I was driving in West Hollywood.  Look at these synchronicities that are coming here.  I am driving in West Hollywood in my, my Cadillac.  And, you know, sometimes when you like.  Roll into a.  Stop sign, you slowly go and you are looking left, but you are going to go to the right, but you are seeing who's left first.  I slowly, like I stop and then I kind of roll slowly across the white line to turn, to look both ways.  And as I turn back this way to the right, there's a runner that's coming in and kind of like stops.  Cause I am rolling in front of him, stops and he punches my car and runs around me and says something, some profanities.  And I took that as like abuse, right?  He punched my car.  He.  Ran off and he said something nasty to me.  I was so triggered at this time.  This is 13 years ago.  I drove after him.  He started going around the block.  I am driving after him.  He turns around one way.  I go in the middle of street, turn around to go after him.  And at one point I stopped my car.  I opened the door in the middle of the street and I start sprinting after him.  That's how crazy the trigger was for me of the abuse.  And I realized, oh, something is wrong.  This was all before my healing journey.  And I realized, oh, something.  Is off.  And so now if some, if that happens again, you know, it would not be that extreme, but if someone cuts me off and I do not like it now, I act differently.  I take a deep breath.  You know, it's like, what was the, what was the point that you said this point number six, seven, what is it?  This one is practice over practice, overcoming your triggers, right?  It's like, we are going to be given our triggers on a daily basis and we get to prepare for them in the beginning of the day and then reflect on how we showed up.  Okay.  So I am going to be able to show up at the end of the day.  I love meditating first thing in the morning and saying, how, how do I want to show up today?  What is my intention for today?  When something goes wrong, how can I respond and rehearsing and practicing it and just noticing, I am going to take a deep breath in my nervous system.  I am going to try to do my best to manage it, not be perfect.  And at the end of the day, I like to reflect, did I show up with the intention I had today?  And I think that is a key in practicing, overcoming yourself.  When you write all these things down, when you think about it, when you write down your.  Okay.  Your money triggers and your stories, you start speaking about them.  You can start to process them.  When you process, you can start to practice it better when it comes up again, because these triggers and things will show up for you constantly in your life until you overcome them.  And so it is a goal and a vision and intention every morning to say, how do I want to show up today?  When something happens, when my mom calls me and asks for money, how do I want to respond?

Let me practice this.  I am not going to be perfect, but let me do better than last.

Let me recite this every day.

Let me praise myself, next moment.  I am going to help bring my relationship better.  Jesus said, God saved me from suffering.  He gave me this life.  He gave me the power to win by the grace of Jesus.  He saved me and I will not make it.  I will not miss whatever it is, I do not want the killed, I want the cares no longer being in my life.

I want to be free forever.

I want to use that to opposed to suffering.

I want to be nuggets.  Now think of this inherited in your voice.  I walk around and think of self.

I want to evolve.

I want to adapt.

I want to advance.

I want to increase level.

I want to make a point on life and my success gets better and better in my own life.  Man, it's so powerful.  I love that example too.  It was a whole movie.  It was like 20, in my head, it was 21 Jump Street.  Oh man, I was.  You are Channing Tatum type, jumping out the car.  You are like, I got speed brother.  You know, the crazy thing is I caught myself because I could have gone and like run this guy down.  Of course.  And I am like, somebody stops and go, what am I doing?  And I am like, my car is back there a quarter mile.  And I am like, am I really going to run this guy down?  And then what?  Beat him up.  And then what?  Go to jail?  Like, what am I doing based on a trauma response?  This does not serve me.  And I had so many of those moments where I was like, something's wrong with me.  And it means I have got to heal and reflect and overcome myself.  Yes.

But this is the thing I love about you.  One of the things I love about you is that, you know, so many people, you share things so many people can identify with, but they do not talk about them.  Yes.  I mean, I am willing to humiliate myself, man.

But, you know, just even sharing, you know, what you went through with your life and your life and your life and your life and your life and your life and your with the abuse and, you know, and what you have gone through again with your parent, losing your father and sharing that story, like it hit different.  I knew about it, but I did not know about the time in your life when it happened.  And just like, you know, it just, again, it helps us to feel more connected and that there is a way.  So number six here in taking yourself to money therapy is to create healthy boundaries.  Man, I have had the, it sounds like you did this with your mom and maybe you did not create it with her, but you created it with yourself.  Right.  I have had different people close to me ask for money over and over again.  And I felt taken advantage of.  And it was not until I spoke up and said, this does not work for me anymore.  This relationship does not work for me anymore.  And I would like to create a new relationship with you around this.  Here's why it does not work.  I feel the only time you reach out to me is when you ask me for money.  That does not feel good.  I do not feel like you care except for that.  I can give you money.  That's not a relationship I want.  Here's the type of relationship I want.  Is that something you are open to?  And having these kind of challenging conversations where I used to just shy away from them and just avoid having them all in all.  Now I am learning how to have the courage to speak up and say, Hey, that does not work for me.  Risk having someone being upset with me and being okay with it.  It's very challenging when you have have anxiety in your chest.  And so I have had to learn that process over the years of having those conversations.  And I have learned how to have that relationship.  And I have learned how to have that relationship over the years of having those tough conversations.  And those boundaries is what has given me peace and abundance.  It's creating those boundaries, being willing to disappoint people at times, but doing it in a loving way.  You cannot determine how they are going to react.

But if you show up for you, you are taking care of that inner child who has all those wounds that you have written down.  And you are saying, I am the adult in the relationship now, I have got you.  No matter what anyone else does, I got you.  And those boundaries create peace and freedom.  And when you tie that to money, it creates financial freedom.  Yes.  I do not think.  We talked about this before the show, but a lot of times with achieving a goal or achieving that success that we want, it's about.  It's not just about the things we do, it's about the things we stop doing.  Because not having those boundaries, that essentially it's a barrier protection.  If there are leaks in that, it's literally leaking your energy to be able to create what you want to create.  Sucking the energy out of it.  Yes.  And so with that example with my mom, because of where my story and where I come from, my heart just wants to take care of my mom.  I just want to take care of my mom.  And what I would do is I take care of my mom that she run from me.  And I feel like I always have to try to run after her and she disappear.  And so.  You are getting new burner phones just to call her.  So she picks up.  Right?  Yes.  When I was a kid, man, and I do not know if I have shared this before, I know I have shared it with my family, but I would have this reoccurring dream.  When I was a kid, like I would have it for years, like maybe.  This was around when my brother was born and then I would have it for years.  I am five years older than him.  And so she was holding him and she was off in the distance.  And so every time I get closer, she would go through the door and then I would go through the door that she was off in the distance again.  And I could not get to her, and she was holding him.  And I felt a little bit like I was not as close to her, you know?  No.  -.  And so I have carried that for years and just wanting to protect my mom, to be there.

But my mom is the type of person, the environment we come from, where she just wants me to be tough.  She does not want me to be too emotional, too soft.  So that's how she raised me.  It was not to be close, but I yearned for that.  Just suck it up, be tough.  You carry that into adulthood to where I have these other, it's showing up in different ways where like, okay, I do this thing for you, you want it from me.  Are you going to call me now?  Are you going to just check in on me?  And that happened for years, right?  And she goes me disappear.

But it's also, again, it's loving her anyways, allowing her to have her story, how she lives her life, but creating that healthy boundary to where I am no longer attached to this thing.  Because it is my mom and my story, I am deciding to, you know what, if you need something, I got you, but I am not going to have any expectation.  And so that was the boundary I set up.  In other circumstances, literally like, no, I am just going to have to decline.  Not with my mom, but like other, situations it's going to depend on you, but please everybody listening for you to heal and to have a better relationship with your finances.  And also this is with life stuff is to intentionally proactively set up some healthy boundaries.  Stop allowing yourself to be hurt.  That's the key.  It's not righteous.  It's not, nobody's going to look back like, you know what?  We were able to abuse the shit out of this person.  We have got to set up some boundaries so that we can create the life that we want to create.  It is your birthright.  So the last one here ties perfectly in taking yourself to money therapy is to motivate yourself to grow.  That's number seven.  I just think, you know, learners are earners.  And when we continue to learn and develop skillsets, we have the ability to earn more again, financially, but earn more spiritually, emotionally, physically, and relationally in life.  And so continue to invest in learning and receiving feedback.  And unfortunately for many years, I would, you know, make the same mistakes over and over again and just be in pain as opposed to saying, okay, this does not work anymore.

Let me take the feedback and start learning new information and acting in a different way.  And it's secular, you know, it's like, you have got to heal the money story to create a new belief system for yourself that something is possible.  And maybe you have never seen it possible for you yet.  Like for years, I did not know it was possible for me to make money.  Once my dad got into his accident, all his money was gone.  He was my backup plan to go work for him.  I did not have a college degree, living on my sister's couch.  I did not know, like, it just did not resonate with me.  Why would anyone give me money?  Why would anyone hire me, give me money?  For what skill?  I did not have any skills.  So I had to shift, start shifting that belief that no one's going to give me any money because I am not valuable enough to earn money in this business world.  And that was a hard thing to shift because I just did not understand.  I did not understand money.  I started researching, reading books, learning about it, and just getting knowledgeable about it.  I would be like, OK, I am learning more.  It's not as scary.  Once I learned more, I found money mentors.  I talk about that in the book as well.  And I found money mentors, and I started asking them questions about, how did they overcome it?  And I could see before and after for them.  OK, I see models, mentors with models that I can mimic.  Great.  Now I just need a money map.  I need a money game plan.  And it does not need to be, what's my 10-year financial plan?  Like, what's the next three months?  How do I get enough money to get off my sister's couch?  Not become a millionaire.  Screw all this Instagram life stuff.  How do I make $1,000 a month?

Let me just figure this one thing out.  And from there, I learn, I act, and I get feedback.  And I laugh my way to the bank.  I learn, I act, and I get feedback.  And that's the key.  I love this so much.  There's so much more that we can cover.  We are getting short on time here.

But I do want to really quickly touch on this, because step three in the book.  So step one in the book is know your money story.  And we dug in on that.  Step two is reset your money mindset.  And that was part of going to therapy.  Yes.

But step three is where you prepare for more money.  That's it.  And these are really digging in on the mindset habit, the mapping habit, the monetizing habit.  I just want to touch on really quickly just a couple of these.  And so when it comes to a mindset habit about money, what do you mean by that?  Most people think that.  When I have money, then I will be generous.  Then I will give.

But we need to be thinking, how can I give and be generous and be grateful first?  Not, I am going to go make money.  And then when I have it, I will give back to charity.  I will give to my friends.  I will give to my church.  It's thinking, how can I be a contribution to the world now?  Whether it be in a bigger scheme or just my world, how can I contribute and be generous?  If you do not have money, how can I give time?  If you do not have time, how can I give other resources, connections?  Being generous with your information.  And a lot of the wealthiest people that I have interviewed, the billionaires, the people who have exited billionaire companies, I ask a question about generosity and how it's tied to making more money.  And probably 95% of the wealthiest people that I have interviewed, when I ask them, when you give uncomfortably a certain amount of money every year, do you usually make more money next year?  And almost all of them say yes.  And they all say that's part of the secret to generating more wealth.  It's by giving more away, you are relaxing and allowing the flow of money to come back.  Now you cannot just say, I am going to give all my money away and do nothing.  You have to provide value.  You have to have a system that can generate more money.

But it's getting uncomfortable and not saying I am going to hoard all my money to myself.  I am also going to contribute it.  I am going to relax.  The more I relax, the more I can receive.  The more I can give.  The more it can come back to me.  So it's shifting this mindset of like, I will give when I make money to, I am going to give what I can right now with the money I have, the time I have, the resources I have.  And be generous now, as opposed to being generous later.  That's for me, the most powerful mindset habit.  Amazing.  Amazing.  Again, we have got seven habits here.  We are just going to touch on one more.

I want to ask you about the monetizing habit.  -.  Monetizing habit is figuring out your money.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Exactly.

But<|it|> , fighters Appliation.  So right, the want to do is not going to go into quá.  So create, create.  It's just, it's a big deal.  Yes.  There you go.  Cuz doing that I am curious about, that I am passionate about.  I just started writing it down.  And I was like, how do you make money with this stuff?  Little did I know all those hidden skill sets that I had is everything I am doing now to make money.  And it's just figuring out how to monetize those skills.  So first is identifying the skills that you have and also identifying the skills you lack and going to master those skills.  I was not able to communicate.  I did not have public speaking skills.  I did not know how to do sales.  I did not know how to do any of these things.  I did not know how to write.  I did not know how to write books.  So I found mentors.  I found a public speaking mentor.  I found a writing mentor because I knew those would be tied to my goals of helping people in the world.  And one guy was a professional speaker that I met.  He said, if you want to influence people and impact people in a positive way, you need to learn how to communicate your message through public speaking.  Whether you are in a boardroom and you work somewhere for 50 years, you are going to need to influence people in an office space, or you are speaking to the masses.  He's like, you need to go to Toastmasters and learn to overcome your fear.  So I had a list of my skills and a list of my fears.  And I started going all into my fears to develop those skills as well.  And I am using all those skills and monetizing them now with what I am doing today.  I love it.  You sure are.  You sure are.  Having fun, man.  You know, and we all have this within us.  We all have unique gifts and talents.  And this is important more today than ever.  Yes.  Is, you know, there's this idea of a personal brand and it's really about you as a person.  Yes.  And doing that internal investigation, that self-assessment to look at like, what do I love?  What would I do for free?  And, you know, if I did not even get paid for it, I would love to do all the time.  For me, strangely, it did not just land in my lap, though.  It was still putting yourself in position.  I had overcome my own health challenges and transformed my body and my health.  And somebody asked me for help at the gym.  They saw me.  They saw my transformation.  You know, this was actually outside of the gym, but they saw me on campus.  It was a friend of mine's sister who was going to the school.  And she was just like, can you help me?  And I literally was like, well, I will meet you at the gym on Saturday.  She was like, how much should I pay you?  What?  You know what?  I get paid to do this?  You would pay me to do what I would do anyways.  And so what are those things that you love to do?  You know, maybe it is like, and again, we do want to get off the couch a little bit, but maybe it is Netflix, right?  Yes.  Yes.  How can you monetize that?  How can you, you can create a podcast around reviews, right?  Create merchandise around it.  You know, maybe find some licensing thing, you know?  Some of the biggest podcasts are watch parties of TV shows.  Yes.  Again, like monetizing what they love.  It's like just watching and talking about it.  Yes.  Maybe you, maybe you are obsessed with My Little Pony.  Maybe you, you know, you, you love a certain sports team.  Pokemon or something.  Pokemon.  Pat Flynn.  He's crushing it, dude.  You know what Pat Flynn is doing?  Of course.  It's amazing.  I watch it.  I do not even like Pokemon.  I like watching his stuff.  It's crazy, man.  He did this as an experiment about a little over a year ago.  He's crushing it.  Him and I are in a mastermind, which another one of your, let me go back.  Okay.  Mastermind habit.  The mastermind habit.  Habit number four is the mastermind habit.  And I am going to, Pat Flynn and I are in a mastermind for about seven years now.  We talk every Monday.  Wow.  Right?  That's great.  And so to see his growth and what he did, like as a, like a side thing, a Pokemon channel that now has, it's getting close to probably two million subscribers.  Crushing, dude.  And I know about the behind the scenes, like what it's doing for his life.  Crushing.  And for his financial business.  It's bringing him joy too.  Yes.  He loves it.  You cannot put a price on joy and freedom.  Yes.  You cannot.  You could have all the money in the world, but you could also have no money and have joy and freedom inside of you.  Yes.  And he has so much joy because he's leaning into his passion and his curiosity.  These hidden skills inside of him that he probably never thought he could monetize.  Yes.  Not only is he monetizing them financially.

But spiritually and emotionally, he's monetizing that joy.  And that is an incredible currency.  Absolutely.  And again, I just encourage everybody, take some time.  If this is important to you, take some time, write out what you are passionate about.  What are the things, what are the top 10 things that you love?  Yes.  That you love to do, you love about life.  Write those things down and look at what are some ways that I could potentially monetize my passions.  And it's not always going to work out like that, but maybe the thing that you are doing is helping you to spend more time doing those passions.  Yes.  And that's a job you are not necessarily passionate about, but there's also this other tentative.  How you do anything is how you do everything.  Yes.  And having that carry over.
