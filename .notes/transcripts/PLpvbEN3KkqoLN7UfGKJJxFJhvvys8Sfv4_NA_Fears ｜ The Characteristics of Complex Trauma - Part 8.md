 Well, welcome to another Friday night. We're continuing our series on these 85 characteristics of complex trauma in the last two weeks  We've looked at how complex trauma affects our emotions and today  What I want to really focus in on is that the main emotion that comes out of complex trauma is fear so fear is just  underlying everything. Often people aren't even aware of it, but it's because the child  constantly felt in danger. They couldn't resolve it. They were constantly in fear.  So it just got kind of repressed, shoved down to their subconscious, but it really runs everything and it can be a very  general feeling of just anxiety, general anxiety, but it can also be about very specific things.  Some they haven't even identified yet. They can't put into words, but once it's explained to them, they're able to put it into words.  And so what I want to focus on today is really the fears that come out of complex trauma.  And so we've already talked about fear of being a burden or a pain,  wanting intimacy, but being afraid of intimacy, wanting to hope, but being afraid to hope, and the fear of abandonment.  So I want to give you a whole bunch of other fears that come out of complex trauma.  So one of the main fears is the fear of being hurt. A child quickly realizes that when you're hurt, it causes a lot of pain.  Now in a healthy home, children get hurt. That's part of life. But what happens is parents come and comfort the child,  teach the child skills,  help the child resolve the problem that caused the hurt and the pain, and it ends up quite well.  The child grows, the pain disappears. The hurt is comforted and healed, but in complex trauma, when a child is living with  people who are all in survival mode, who are all using maladaptive ways of coping, the child is going to get hurt a lot.  And so they're going to be in pain a lot. So they're going to be abused and neglected, laughed at, shamed, punished unjustly.  There's just needs aren't going to be met. There's going to be hurt, hurt, hurt, all the time.  But there's nothing that they can do to resolve it because nobody's given the tools, nobody is helping them.  The people that are supposed to be helping them are actually causing the hurt.  And so the child quickly develops a fear of being hurt and the child develops a belief that intimate relationships  always resulting getting hurt. And then the child develops a commitment.  That getting hurt is something to be avoided at all possible. So now they have a fear of getting hurt.  But they go now going to adult life, assuming that any intimate relationship will result in getting hurt,  and so as soon as they enter an intimate relationship, because they're lonely, they long for love, they long for acceptance, they long for intimacy.  But soon as they enter it, their expectation and their brain is, oh, no, I'm unsafe.  It's almost like their brain thinks they're back in a complex trauma environment. I'm going to get hurt. I'm going to get hurt.  Even though it could be with a super safe person, their brain, as soon as they go back in a relationship, assumes they're in an unsafe environment,  assumes they're going to get hurt and basically sends them back into all the old ways of coping.  So that fear of getting hurt really prevents people from then having healthy relationships because they're using old coping tools  to prevent getting hurt. So they're not authentic, they're wearing masks, they're not trusting, they're manipulating, they're controlling all kinds of different things  that they have done in the past and not get hurt, which makes healthy relationships impossible.  So the fear of getting hurt is just a massive issue for people coming out of complex trauma.  That ties in with the next fear, which is the fear of failure. So the result of life is that we do fail.  So you just think of a child learning to walk. You fall. That means you fail. You fall on your face. You scrape your knee.  You learn a new skill like riding your bike or tying your shoe. You don't do it perfectly the first time.  You fail as you learn the skills. That's part of life. But then also children will have times when they are upset  and so they lash out and hurt somebody or they disobey. They let people down. They let themselves down. They don't accomplish the goals they set.  So part of life is realizing that failure happens. Now in a healthy home, parents are patient with a child learning to tie their shoes  right a bike, learning to walk. They don't punish that kind of failure. Spilling milk, they don't punish that failure.  That's a child being human, a child learning. When a child disobeyes, when a child lashes out, they confront that.  They help the child realize that violates love. It's going to hurt them and others. They give consequences that help the child go back to love.  But there's a nurturing, loving environment so that the child ends up growing as a result of failure.  So failure might cause the child to feel some pain, but in a healthy home it always results in growth.  It always results in the child developing more skills, more character, making them better.  But in complex trauma, failure always resulted in something bad. So not only did you fail but because you failed, now you got punished for failing.  Now you got shamed for failing. Now you were disrespected because you had failed. Failure never resulted in anything good.  It always resulted in more pain. So you have the pain of failure but now you have extra pain piled on top of being shamed and punished.  So failure became something to avoid it at all costs, which created a deep fear of failure because bad stuff happens when you fail.  So complex trauma trains a person to have unhealthy responses to failure.  You now treat failure in a way that actually makes things worse.  So now you're afraid to try anything new, so you don't learn new skills, you don't develop.  Well that sets you up for even greater problems down the road.  Or if you do fail, you punish yourself, beat yourself up and that only makes things worse.  So all of the responses to failure make things worse and make people even more vulnerable to fail.  So this fear of failure actually can become a very dangerous force in the lives of people coming out of complex trauma.  And it's important in recovery to realize that I'm not going to do recovery perfect the first time.  I'm not going to learn to live healthy perfectly the first time.  It's going to involve learning new skills, which means failure.  And I will not get punished for failure if I'm with safe people.  I will learn from the failure and I will grow as a result of it.  So failure is not to be avoided.  Failure is something that's part of life that can be a positive.  The next fear is fear of the unknown for a person with complex trauma.  The unknown means I'm in a situation where I don't know what to expect.  I can't predict what might happen.  I don't know the details so I can't protect myself.  So being in the unknown puts me in great danger of being hurt or of failing.  So I fear the unknown.  I do not like the unknown.  It always potentially will result in something bad.  So for people coming on a complex trauma, being in the unknown creates a feeling of not being safe.  It creates a feeling in the brain that, oh, I'm not safe.  I'm back in complex trauma.  Oh, oh, I'm in the unknown.  I better go to a fight flight freezer font.  I better go back to old survival protective behaviors.  So fear of the unknown is something that happens frequently for people coming on a complex trauma.  But living life as an adult means regularly being in the unknown because life changes.  Circumstances change.  And so if this fear isn't dealt with, they can slide back into old behaviors very quickly without realizing it  and soon find themselves doing a lot of damage.  The next fear is connected to fear of the unknown and that's the fear of change.  And so every time I go through a change, so I get a new job, I move to a new location,  I get in a new relationship.  All of those changes mean I'm now in a situation I've never faced before.  That means it's an unknown.  Something could happen that I wasn't prepared for, that I didn't anticipate.  And that increases the possibility of being hurt or of failure.  And so for people coming out of complex trauma, change is a scary thing because it puts them into a  place that their brain perceives as being dangerous.  And so as a result, many avoid change.  They only change if they are forced to change.  But when they are in change, every time they go through a change, without even realizing it subconsciously,  they get more angry, they get more negative, they lash out, they start resorting to old coping tools  because the brain does not like change.  So part of recovery for people is learning that when they go into change,  that a whole bunch of subconscious systems start to kick off.  So they need to become aware of those subconscious systems, bring them to the conscious level  and begin to realize, okay, change isn't bad, change can actually be to wonderful things.  There's the need to be cautious, but not afraid.  So I don't need to go to old tools here, I can use new tools.  The next fear is a very subtle fear, but it's a powerful fear for people coming out of complex  trauma. And that's the fear of success. So the fear of success is, again, a very subconscious thing,  but it's as soon as life is going well, as soon as life is going smoothly, it makes me afraid.  So what is that all about? And so in complex trauma, when a child lives with abuse and neglect  and chaos, if life is starting to go smoothly, usually in their mind, something bad is about to happen.  The other shoe is about to drop. Dad has been nice now for a few days, but now dad's about to  get angry again. It's all about to go downhill. And so that sets up a system in the brain that  as soon as things start going smoothly, the other shoe is about to drop. So the next one for  people is, if I succeed at something, when my life has been chaotic, when my life has been struggling  and failing and not doing well, if I start succeeding, that puts me in a place where it's all brand new,  it's changed, it's unknown. I might not know how to handle it, I might fail, I might get hurt,  and I might be exposed as being an imposter. Oh, you don't belong here, you're really not good at  this. You're just acting here. This isn't the real you. And everybody's going to see how terrible I am.  So to succeed is to put myself more visible and is to put myself in change and in the unknown,  all of the things that I'm afraid of. The next one is that if I'm successful, then people will  notice me, but then they might start expecting more of me. So I won't be able to remain invisible.  I won't be able to remain somewhat irresponsible. I won't be able to just do my little  little bits of taking care of me. I know we'll have greater expectations placed on me. So that then  leads to the next characteristic that comes out of the fear of success. And that is sabotaging good  things. So the child says, if things are going well, the other shoe is about to drop. Everything's  going to fall apart. So I might as well just get it over with. I will sabotage things. I will get  that angry. I will make things worse. I'll make that shoe drop. What the child is thinking that is  hopefully I can control the amount of pain delivered if I am bringing about the other shoe dropping.  Another thing that's going on in the child's mind is, okay, I'm succeeding. I'm succeeding, but  I won't be able to do everything perfectly. So I might as well sabotage it all, because I'm going  to fail anyway. So let's just get the failure part over with. Or as I succeed, everybody's going to  eventually see that I'm an imposter, and they're going to see that I'm not as great as my job is  making me look. So you know what, let's just sabotage it all. And so shame causes the sabotage.  Shame wins out. Then with the fear of abandonment, what happens is the other person's eventually going  to get to see the authentic me and see that I'm not much of a catch to see that I'm a terrible person,  the shame lies. So they're going to abandon me eventually. So you know what, let's just get it over  with. I will either abandon them first, or I will do a bunch of stuff to sabotage the relationship  so that they will abandon me. I'll push them to abandon me. Or codependency can be part of this.  So if I keep growing, eventually I'm going to have greater and greater distance between my partner  or my family who's refusing to grow, and I'm going to lose them. So you know what, let's just  sabotage this recovery stuff because I don't want to lose them. So I'll sabotage it so I hang on  to very unhealthy toxic people because I need that relationship for some reason. There's another  reason people sabotage. And that is when you've grown up with most of your subconscious templates about  what is normal being unhealthy, then when you do something healthy it feels wrong. So if you grew up  with narcissists, and that was your normal, when you now have a relationship with a healthy person,  it feels weird, it feels wrong. If you grew up where you were trained to deny your needs and that  you were being selfish, if you took care of yourself, and now you start to take care of yourself,  and meet your needs, that feels wrong, that feels selfish. So what happens for a lot of people is  to go from a unhealthy template to try to go to a healthy template feels wrong, it feels weird,  it feels very uncomfortable. It puts you into this situation where you go, I don't like this feeling,  it feels just bad. You know what, let's sabotage it all and go back to what feels normal, what feels  comfortable. There's another reason people sabotage, and that's guilt. I've dealt with many clients who  their life starts succeeding, and they go, I don't deserve this good life, because of the bad stuff I've  done. I need to sabotage all that's going well, so I go back to failing, because that's what I deserve.  So sabotage becomes part of complex trauma, because there's so many fears that come out of the  different issues created by complex trauma. So part of recovery is realizing, becoming aware of  the times when my impulse to sabotage kicks in, and often it could start subconsciously, but I  become aware of it, and I go, whoa, I'm not going to sabotage here. I am going to trust the process,  and I'm going to get out of my limbic brain, get back into my cortex, and stick with the plan,  and they become very thankful that they did. The next fear is fear of conflict. Most people from  complex trauma don't deal well with conflict, they hate conflict. So in a healthy home, conflict,  you realize conflict is part of every relationship, you don't always agree, you misunderstand each  other, you have different tastes and preferences, you do things sometimes accidentally that hurt each  other, so conflict becomes part of normal relationships, but what happens is the goal is we want to  resolve it, we want to grow from this, both of us want to grow. We want this to turn into improving  our relationship, fixing a problem, so you work at it with respect, you work at it out of love,  you work at it with a desire to grow, and that's what happens. So conflict turns into a very positive  growth thing, not so in complex trauma. Nothing good comes out of conflict in complex trauma,  there's always going to be a winner and a loser, and the person who wins is going to punish the people  who lose. So you're not going to lose the argument, you are going to get then shamed, you are then  going to get love with hell from you, you're going to get punished somehow. So on top of the conflict  and the stress of the conflict, then you get hurt powered on, then you get more punishment and other  hurts powered on, so that conflict always results in more pain, nothing good comes out of it,  a ton of damage takes place, it is a bad thing. And so for many people coming out of complex trauma,  conflict to them is to be avoided at all costs. So their commitment is keep the peace, never rock the  boat, take care of the other person's emotions if they're starting to get a little upset so that  it doesn't result in conflict. So do whatever they want to make them happy so that they don't get  mad, tell lies, deny problems, sweep stuff under the rug, stick your head in the sand, just agree with  who's ever in power, be a yes man, avoid conflict, conform to whatever rules and expectations they have  to keep them happy, that's the only way to have peace, that's the only way to have any chance of  happiness. Now that gives short term, truces but doesn't give true peace because you never feel safe,  you can't be authentic, you're not fully accepted, and so it doesn't truly work. So in recovery,  I have found for many people coming out of complex trauma that learning to enter into conflict,  learning to do conflict well is scary, but once they start to experience it and learn the tools  and see the benefits that come out of healthy conflict, it is a very important part of their growth.  Now this is connected to the next fear, people coming out of complex trauma have a fear of angry people.  So an angry person to them is a person who is dysregulated and therefore has great difficulty  controlling themself, they're so angry they have a powerful impulse that they cannot control to  lash out and hurt people and somebody will get hurt. So an angry person as a person that loses  their ability to control how they act, the impulses they have because their anger is so intense,  and so tremendous damage will always be in their wake. Somebody is going to get hurt but they've  also realized growing up that an angry person who's promised to never say something disrespectful,  to never hit somebody again, when they're angry they forget all about those boundaries, they are,  they walk all over the boundaries they've set for themself, and then when they're angry if you  try to set a boundary and say you said you would never do this or stay out of my room,  they do not respect your boundaries. So an angry person loses all their filters, loses their  ability to have internal boundaries and stick to them and does not respect the boundaries of others.  And then they realized if you try to reason with somebody when they're angry they can't be  reasoned with because they're totally in their limbic brain with cortisol pumping and they  are irrational. So an angry person you cannot resolve it, you cannot help them, you cannot help  yourself. So the only solution is stay away, stay out of their way, get as far as you can away from  an angry person. So today for many people coming out of complex trauma, when they see somebody angry  they immediately go into a strong desire to flight, to flee, to avoid this angry person.  It is a powerful impulse. That's what their brain has concluded after years of seeing the damage  that angry persons do. Now let's go on to the next fear. It's the fear of losing what gives them  value. So we saw that shame results in trying to get value from the wrong things. So your body,  your possessions, your brains, your money, all of those things. So here's what happens. So think of  a woman who's got her sense of value from her looks, her beauty and her body. And that's got her  tons of respect. She's been able to get her needs met because of that. She gets what feels like  love often because of that. But then she's starting to get into her 40s. And so age and gravity are  starting to take their effect on her body and on her looks. She's starting to lose what's given her  value. That creates a ton of fear. That creates great insecurity. And so what happens for many people  is, and this is what sometimes get classified as a midlife crisis is all of a sudden they are running  around getting cosmetic surgery. They're putting tons of time and effort into exercising, into getting  lotions and all kinds of different things to try and prevent the aging of their body because they  are in great fear of losing what gives them value because in their mind once they've lost their  beauty and their body, they are a zero. They have no value. Think of a person whose all their values  come out of performance, their job. They're very good at what they do. It gets them respected. It gets  them all their needs met. Now they're coming up on retirement. And so all of a sudden they have  this tremendous insecurity. What's going to happen to me? Who am I? Do I have any value now? Well,  anybody respect me anymore when anybody want to be my friend anymore. The same fear kicks in.  Or think of a person who's gained all their value from their money and their possessions. But then  hurricane hits. And they lose their home. They lose their business. And so all of a sudden all of the  things that gave them value are threatened. They've lost their money or let's say the economy crashes  and they lose their money. They have to declare bankruptcy. That creates tremendous fear.  Who then am I? What value do I have? So most people don't realize that they have this fear  until something is threatened, something that they were depending on to give them value. So they  start aging or they're approaching retirement or there's a natural disaster or the economy crashes.  But it could also be they're in a car accident or they have some other health problems  or some other type of accident. And all of a sudden they're disabled. All of a sudden it affects  their mental health. It affects their ability to use their brain the way they used to. It gives them  limitations they didn't have before. When things get threatened due to external circumstances,  things that I depended on for value, all of a sudden this fear rushes. Now who am I?  Probably everybody now looks down on me. Shame begins to take over. So this again to me is why it's  so important in recovery to deal with shame, to get out of that mindset that I don't have any  inherent value or my value.
