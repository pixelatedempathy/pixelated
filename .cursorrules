# Pixelated Empathy - AI Agent Rules

> **Primary Rules**: See `WARP.md` for comprehensive project guidelines and workflows.

This file bridges AI Agent with the project's main rule system. All rules in WARP.md apply here.

## Quick Reference

**Package Managers (CRITICAL)**:
- Node.js: `pnpm` ONLY (never npm/yarn)
- Python: `uv` ONLY (never pip/conda/venv)

**Essential Commands**:
```bash
pnpm install && uv install     # Setup
pnpm dev                       # Start dev server
pnpm dev:all-services          # All services
pnpm check:all && pnpm test:all  # Quality checks
pnpm security:check            # Security validation
```

**Before Committing**:
```bash
pnpm check:all          # Lint, format, typecheck
pnpm test:all           # All tests pass
pnpm security:check     # No secrets
```

## Code Style

**TypeScript/JavaScript**:
- 2 spaces, no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas
- Strict types, avoid `any` (use `unknown` + type guards)
- PascalCase: Components/interfaces
- camelCase: variables/functions

**Python**:
- PEP 8 compliance, type hints required
- Use `uv` for all package management

## Security & Ethics

**CRITICAL**: This platform handles sensitive mental health data.

1. Never expose secrets (redact API keys, tokens, PII)
2. Validate all input (especially emotion scores 0-1 range)
3. HIPAA compliance required
4. No harmful AI patterns or stereotypes
5. Handle edge cases (crisis signals, silence, cultural variations)

## Workflow

**New Feature**:
1. Check AGENTS.md for major architectural changes
2. Write tests first (TDD approach)
3. Implement with minimal, focused edits
4. Run `pnpm check:all && pnpm test:all`
5. Security check: `pnpm security:check`

**Avoid**:
- Wrong package managers (`npm`/`yarn`/`pip`/`conda`)
- Type safety violations (`any` without justification)
- Missing input validation
- Hardcoded secrets
- Over-engineering
