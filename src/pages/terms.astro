            The BAA outlines our respective obligations regarding Protected
            Health Information (PHI) and can be accessed in your account
            settings. You must execute a BAA with us before using our services
            to process, transmit, or store PHI.

            13. HIPAA-Specific Termination Provisions
          </h2>
          <p>
            For healthcare providers subject to HIPAA, we adhere to specific
            termination requirements:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
            <li>
              At termination of the BAA, we will extend the protections of the
              BAA to PHI for a longer transition period
            </li>
            <li>
              We will facilitate the secure transfer of PHI to another service
              provider or directly to you
            </li>
            <li>
              We will implement a secure data destruction process for PHI in
              accordance with HIPAA standards
            </li>
            <li>
              We will provide certification of proper destruction of PHI upon
              request
            </li>
          </ul>

            14. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution
          </h2>
          <p>
            These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
            the laws of the State of California, without regard to its conflict
            of law provisions.
          </p>
          <p>
            Any dispute arising from or relating to these Terms or our services
            shall first be attempted to be resolved through informal
            negotiation. If the dispute cannot be resolved through negotiation,
            it shall be submitted to binding arbitration in accordance with the
            rules of the American Arbitration Association, with arbitration to
            take place in San Francisco, California.
          </p>
          <p>
            You agree that any arbitration shall be conducted on an individual
            basis and not in a class, consolidated, or representative action.
            Any claim must be filed within one year after the cause of action
            arises.
          </p>
