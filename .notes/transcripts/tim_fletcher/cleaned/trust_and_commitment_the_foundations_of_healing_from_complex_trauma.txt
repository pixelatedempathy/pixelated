What happens for many people in complex trauma is they were not taught tools that are important tools for learning to meet your needs learning to live in this life and so part of reparenting is teaching yourself tools you did not receive as a child so emotional regulation learning how to regulate your emotions if you did not get taught that as a child now you have to teach yourself you have to re-parent yourself or self-care if you were not taught how to care for your needs then you have to teach yourself the tools to do that the second thing is you have to begin to treat yourself in healthy ways if you were not treated in certain areas in healthy ways as a child so if you were criticized a lot you now learn to validate yourself to treat yourself with compassion with validation so you are beginning to change your story about how you are going to treat yourself and that's re-parenting so for today we are going to look at one of the foundational blocks that every person needs in their life if they are going to become a healthy person and we talked about it in the very first talk on the stages of development and that is a child needs trust they have to be able to trust people in order to develop so we talked about the need for them to attach to be authentic and to trust three key foundational stones for building a healthy life but what i want to focus on as well is in order for a child to be able to trust they need to have parents who are committed and consistent if they are not committed and consistent with the child then they are that child is not going to learn trust so you need two trust and commitment the two go together so as i talk about this today i am very aware that you are probably going to listen to me on three levels if you are a parent you are going to think about your children learning trust and therefore your need to be committed and consistent if you are in an intimate relationship you are going to learn about the need for trusting each other but that means being consistent in your relationship and committed to each other and if you are in recovery you are going to learn that re-parenting means that wounded part of you stopped trusting a long time ago and it needs to be able to trust again.

But to be able to trust again, the starting point is you have to be committed to yourself.  You have to be committed to that wounded child inside of you.  You have to be committed to meeting your needs if you are going to learn to trust.  So the starting point of learning to trust again for people in recovery is being committed to meet your own needs.  Somebody has said this, when you make a commitment, you build hope.  When you keep that commitment, you build trust.  And that's just a very wonderful way to say it.

Now, what I have realized over the years is that for many people who grew up in complex trauma, commitment to them means something very different than somebody else who grew up in complex trauma.  And it really depends on their experience.  And so I think that's a really important thing to be able to do.  So they do not necessarily have a true understanding or picture of commitment and trust.  It's very much shaped by their complex trauma experience.  So just for an example, you might have grown up in a family where your physical needs were not met very well or your emotional needs.  So for you, commitment means a parent who meets your needs.  And that's how you define commitment.  And it's very limited.  And you are not going to be able to do that.  So at that point in your life, you are not going to be able to accept what your parents would do to you.  Or it depends on how well your parents would help you fill your misunderstanding or your understanding to just the meeting of needs.  Or you grew up in a place where you did not feel safe.  And so for you, commitment means a parent who keeps me safe.  Or your parents just were not attuned to your needs at all.  They did not pay attention to you.  Commitment to you might be defined just as somebody attuned to meeting my needs some other ones that people have is they grew up where parents did not do anything fun with them and so for them commitment is you do fun things together or parents who broke their promises so commitment is you keep your promises or parents who did not set good boundaries or enforce those boundaries or parents who did not stick together through tough times and so for you commitment is sticking together no matter what or you had parents that cheated on each other so the emphasis for you is commitment is you are faithful sexually to your partner parents who did not fulfill their responsibilities or parents who did not make sacrifices and so for you commitment is all about sacrifices and responsibility so all of that just to say be aware as you think about this topic of your early definitions of what commitment means now having said that i want to then go to k what does commitment mean what is a full picture that will help us understand commitment because you cannot build trust unless there's somebody in your life who's committed to you so commitment i want you to understand is the essential part of your relationship so the first component is commitmentじゃあ when an enriched when you want to grow together go out there and spread the gospel and have fun doing them and in that way can you come to that middle point and how you reach those sentiments now when you have someone contacting you for a while there's always there's still grass between to a beyond a certain point and that is so important to understand so commitment is continuing to do the right thing even when you do not feel like it it's continuing to follow the same priorities principles course of action at all times regardless of the circumstances now in complex trauma it's very important to understand that in light of the limbic brain versus the cortex brain so commitment will never get carried out if you live only in your limbic brain because that's your child brain and what does the child brain say I will do something if I feel like it but if I do not feel like it I am not going to do it well that's not going to carry out a commitment it's going to be a commitment to the child brain and that's what commitment is and that's a commitment if you only do it when you feel like it and so to maintain commitment you have to go to your cortex that says I am going to do this on days I feel like it but also on days I do not feel like it so what is involved it's hanging in there when life gets hard and overwhelming it's continuing to do the right thing day after day even though you are not seeing immediate results it's like the farmer who plants the seed waters it weeds it but is not seeing results yet there's a waiting time but you are still doing the right stuff but then with commitment there's an element of exclusivity that you are faithful sexually and emotionally now foreign to have a healthy relationship with my wife I have to be committed to her but if I am committed to her then that means I cannot have that type of relationship with any other women in the world so it excludes other people if I am going to have a healthy relationship with my children I got to be committed to them and that means I cannot be using all of my time doing other things and and having tons of other relationships with other people because that would take away from my commitment to my children so just having a committed relationship means I have to exclude relationships with others and it means I cannot say yes to all kinds of activities I have to start saying no to a whole bunch of activity because that will prevent me from carrying out my commitment to my children and I might be saying no to very worthwhile activities but I have to in order to maintain that commitment the next thing that happens in a committed relationship is it's the understanding that your needs are just as important as mine so that we are going to work together to make sure both of our needs are being met so I am going to meet some of my own needs but I am going to need your help with others you are going to meet most of your needs but you are going to need my help with others so that then means at times we are going to have to make sacrifices at times we are going to have to give when we are not feeling we are getting anything back right away so sacrifice becomes part of this but then it also means I am not going to abandon you now this is really important for people from complex trauma because what happens in complex trauma when you do not feel somebody's there for you to help you through a difficult situation is you feel abandoned but then what happens is you believe that you must be the reason they abandon you you must have many flaws you are not worth it so you then abandon yourself you do not even like yourself and so what happens now in being committed to yourself is you are saying to the wounded part of you I will not abandon you again I am committed to working through this stuff with you the next thing that's part of commitment is open honest communication and no secrets we are going to share and talk honestly but then it means accepting the person that you are in the relationship with where they are at their personality you accept them as they are and you form an attachment with them a secure attachment that means you are a Safe person that means you are attuned to how they are doing you are aware of their emotions that means that you care about their pain just as much as you care about your own pain that means you work hard through your challenge through operation and those issues that you know will have paid off that can be THAT'S WHAT YOU are DOING WHEN YOU have BEEN SUPPOSED TO 이 מאוד means you work hard to get to understand them so that you get them so that you get to know them intimately their deepest dreams passions fears wounds you want to understand them that's part of commitment it also involves you desire what is best for them and it means you are all in many people from complex trauma when they go into a relationship they go in with always needing an escape hatch if this gets a little bit tough I am out of here with commitment is I have got to know you and I am prepared to commit to you which means I am all in I am going to give myself to this I am jumping in with both feet and what that means is not only do I choose you today I am going to choose you again tomorrow and I am going to choose you the next day I am going to choose you over and over and over again more than that commitment means we are going to have problems but we are going to work them out we are going to resolve them and to do that I have to be willing to own my part you have to be willing to own your part we both have to be willing to change that's the only place where commitment will work to produce healthy people as we have problems commitment means we are committed to respect each other even in the problems I am not going to disrespect you further I am going to be willing to go to being vulnerable as we work through problems and that means I am going to expose weaknesses to you I am going to be authentic I am going to share who I really am with you and then when it comes to making decisions I am going to do my thinking not just so that the decision benefits me but so that it benefits both of us so I am going to think for two when I am thinking about a decision and I want it to benefit you just as much as it benefits me I am going to show up on days that I am tired hurt angry stressed out distracted I am still choosing to be present and to love even on those difficult days now think of where did commitment begin it began by thinking this person has value this person means a lot to me and so what I am going to do moving forward is continue to see you and treat you as somebody is having great value to me that therefore means that yes I will acknowledge weaknesses that you have but I am not going to focus on them with a desire to tear you down because if I focus only on the negatives in you you will lose value in my mind which will cause me to have trouble maintaining my commitment so to keep my commitment growing I have to continue to choose to treat you with respect to see you as having great value to me and then for people with complex trauma commitment means fighting through fears that are going to be triggered as the relationship deepens as the relationship deepens there's going to be a fear of oh oh and I do care but that's not trying drew on my commitments fear every moment I am alwayshuh hear we have to save that need to serve me to see myero OF USE the fear our日本ese care is really about improving the shape and government oh, they are getting to know me better, or are they going to abandon me?  And so your natural instinct at that time will be, let's just sabotage this relationship.

But commitment says, no, I am going to press through that fear, and I am going to not sabotage this relationship.  I am going to continue to be present and to be authentic and work through my fears.  That is tough.  So those are 26 characteristics of commitment.  Somebody said this, nothing is sexier than someone who can face temptations and have the level of maturity to say, this is not worth losing what I have.  So commitment is multifaceted.  Now let's go to trust.  So you need commitment to build trust.

But, once trust is there, it can easily be broken.  And what is surprising to many people is that trust is often slowly chipped away at until it's finally gone.  And the things that slowly can chip away at trust are often small little things that even seem insignificant.  So let me just give you some of the things that can slowly chip away, at trust in a relationship.  If you are a person who repeatedly says that you are going to be there at a certain time, and you never show up on time, that very slowly can erode trust.  Or, if you are in circumstances and you do not make your partner a priority, you put other things ahead of them, that can begin to erode trust.  If you are only interested in trust, if you are only interested in your partner when you want something from your partner, like sex or something else, that will erode trust.  If you are not there for your partner when they are hurting, or when they are sick, that will erode trust.  If you do not keep your promises, if you do not contribute to the well-being of your family, you are just off in your own little world and the family can do what it wants, that begins to erode trust.  That begins to erode trust.  That begins to erode trust.  That begins to erode trust.  Or another way to say that is, if your approach to your family or relationships is me rather than we, that will erode trust.

So, if you are quite content that your partner take care of 75% of the responsibilities of the family, and you just like to spend time with your friends, doing your hobbies, and you just do a little bit with the family, that's going to erode trust big time.  That's going to erode trust big time.  If you do not keep secrets, or if you keep secrets from your partner, or you blab what your partner shares with you that you should have kept secret, both of those will erode trust.  If you tell a lie, if you never apologize, never own your part, that begins to erode trust.  If you disrespect your partner, in public or in private, and do things that are humiliating to them, and put them down, that begins to erode trust.  If you are emotionally unfaithful by getting emotionally involved with somebody else, or physically involved, of course that erodes trust.  Or if you are physically violent, or you do not regulate your emotions, that can begin to erode trust.  Or if you make bad decisions with money, that can erode trust.  If you are just a lazy person, or you are always procrastinating on things, that can erode trust.  If you fall into addiction, that will erode trust.  If you are a hypocrite, you have a great way of talking about what you are going to do, or what should be done, you just do not ever do it, that erodes trust.  If you are inconsistent in enforcing rules, and boundaries, that will erode trust.  If you are a people pleaser, and you are not good at saying no to others, that will erode trust with those closest to you.  That's a lot of different things that erode trust.  And you can see then that any unhealthy behavior has the potential of chipping away at trust.  So trust takes a lot to build, but it can be easily destroyed through unhealthy behaviors.  Now I want to take this in a little different direction.  So remember that I said, you are committed to somebody initially because they have value to you.  What I want you to think about is, especially for people from complex trauma, every day in a relationship, you are asking, does the person's words, actions, communicate that I still have value?  That is the ongoing question in your mind.  So let me just break that down.  That can mean every day you are looking at how they treat you, what they say to you, how they use their time, how they interact with others, what they do when you are in a group together, in a social setting, how they then treat you, how they interact with others, and you are going to say, do they still care?  Do they still cherish me?  Or how important am I to you?  Am I more important to you than your parents are?  Am I more important to you than your friends are?  Or your job?  Or your personal hobbies?  Where do I fit in your top priorities?  Constantly being evaluated.  Do I come first in your life?  And that might be for some, do I come first next to your higher power?  Do you just take me for granted?  Have you stopped really appreciating me and you are just assuming I am going to be there for you?  Are you looking around, checking to see if there might be somebody better than I am in your life?  Will you keep caring for me even when you are struggling or when you are hurting or when you are sick?  Or will you keep caring for me even when I am struggling?  When I am hurting?  How about when I start losing my beauty?  Will you still value me then?  Will you care for me when you are frustrated with me?  Will you still value me?  Are you committed to care for me just out of a sense of duty that this is your obligation, but really you see me as a bit of a burden?  Or do you still care for me because you delight in me?  All of those are the ongoing questions when there's a committed relationship.  How committed is it is really what it's boiling down to.  And what that therefore means is, how much do you value me?  So let me then take that further.  What then do you do when trust has been broken?  So let me make that really practical.  And let's look at this in the same way.  What if you had a sense of reparenting yourself today?  So there's a part of you that you abandoned.  There's a part of you that where trust was broken.  You were not committed to yourself, to care for yourself, to care for the wounded part of yourself.  How do you rebuild that trust today?  Number one, have a conversation with little you.  Let little you, the abandoned part of you, talk about what it was like to be abandoned by parents, what it was like to be abandoned by you.  Let them share their feelings without you trying to blame anybody or shutting them down.  Listen to them talk about what it felt like to be abandoned and then to have nobody they could trust.

But then make a commitment to them.  Make a commitment to yourself today to meet your 12 needs that you will not abandon that child again.  And that will be their deepest fear.  So make that commitment and make sure you are making it in your cortex, not just out of your limbic brain.

But that then means figuring out how to maintain internal boundaries.  So if you are going to meet your 12 needs consistently, you have to make a commitment to get a certain amount of sleep, to eat a certain way, to get exercise, to take care of yourself emotionally, to be mindful of how you are doing.  So you set boundaries.  I am going to get up at this time.  I am going to have a time to meditate, to do an inventory of how I am doing.  I am going to do different physical type of exercises.  I am making a commitment.  How am I going to maintain that commitment?  Because that's where the rubber meets the road.  That's what that commitment needs to look like is the maintaining of those internal boundaries.  And that's what the little wounded you is waiting to see.  Are you going to keep that commitment to care for me, to meet my needs?  And then learn to cherish and love yourself in a healthy way.  And learn to cherish.  Remember, little you often will contain the parts of you that you hated when you were little.  You hated that you were so sensitive, that you were so emotional, that you got so angry.  You wanted to shove that part of you into a closet or cut it off somehow.  That's the part of you that now you need to accept.  And you need to be able to cherish.  So what I want to do is give you ways to cherish yourself or your children or your partner.  Practical things that you can do that will keep the value part alive.  So remember, to maintain a commitment, it started with I value you.

But to keep that commitment going strong, I have to do something.  I have to do things that strengthen my sense of valuing you.  I have to do things that help me cherish you on an ongoing basis.  And so these are practical things you can do to strengthen the cherish value part, which will then strengthen the commitment.  So I will go through these quickly.  Create a ritual time together.  A date night.  You can date yourself.  You can go for a date night with each of your children, with your partner.  It's a planned time just to enjoy them.  Just to do things together.  Very important to do.  Tell them regularly the positive qualities that they have.  Identify them.  Do not just say generically, you are a wonderful person.  Specify those positive qualities.  Have fun with them.  Do not just make the time with them always serious.  You need serious times of sharing, but you need to enjoy times together.  Comfort them when they are hurting.  Check in with them several times a day just to let them know you are thinking of them, just to ask them how they are doing.  Write them little notes.  Leave them in their lunches.  Leave them on their pillow.  Things that say, I love you, I appreciate you.  And if they are wanting or needing your attention, stop what you are doing and give them your full attention.  Buy them something that is meaningful to them, that communicates that they are special to you.  Ask them specific questions about their life.  Do a project.  Do a project together that they would enjoy doing.  Do service activities together.  So you are working together as a team in helping others.  Set boundaries with other people who are wanting more and more of your time, who are needy or who are pushy.

But set boundaries to say, no, I am not going to let you have more of my time because that would violate the time I need to carry out my commitment to this relationship.  Do something with them that they enjoy but might not be enjoyable to you.  So if it's with one of your children, they might want to have a tea party and that would bore you to death.

But do it because it means so much to them.  Support them in their interests.  So if they want to take up a musical instrument, support them in that.  If they want to take a course so they can keep learning and growing, support them in those kind of things.  Open up to them about your feelings.  Allow some vulnerability, age appropriate, but begin to do that.  Let them be themselves.  And if you have a child or partner who's a little bit eccentric, odd-dock, quirky, come to me.  I am going to help you.  I am going to help you.  You are quirky, come to accept that.  Do not try to shut them up because it embarrasses you.  Have their back when somebody attacks them.  Stand up for them.  If they are having a really bad day and they just cannot do some of the things they need to do, step in and help.  Always treat them with respect, even when they are having a bad day and not acting the best.  Do not shame them.  Do not disrespect them.  Work hard to resolve any problems that have come up in the relationship.  Communicate a lot.  And so for some of us, that means more than just how's your day and here's what I did today.  It means filling up space and time sometimes with just more superficial communication, just so that communication is happening.  Be in their corner.  If they have times when they doubt themselves, be there to encourage them to validate their positive qualities.  So there's a whole lot that is part of building trust.  There has to be commitment.

But to be commitment, you have to validate.  You have to cherish.  You have to value them and nurture that on an ongoing basis.  I hope that just helps you in your relationships, but it helps you reparent yourself so that you can begin to live out that commitment to yourself that is so important in getting healthy again.
