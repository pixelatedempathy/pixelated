What I would say after being in this field of counseling for the last 15 years, that is very wise advice.  I have dealt with many people who have been in a relationship with a narcissist and they have not been a gray rock or they have not gotten no contact.  And before you know it, the next thing happens.  So here's what I want you to get.  Giving chase is how a narcissist responds to rejection.  If you say no, to them, no does not mean no.  It means try harder.  And so they are going to chase.  Now what they are counting on is a couple of things.  Number one, once you have said no, if you have not dealt with your own shame, after a couple of weeks, you are going to start to miss them.  And you are going to feel lonely.  And you are going to feel all your shame issues coming up.  And then what's going to happen?  Your mind's going to go back to, not to the discard stage, not to the devalue stage, but to the fantasy idealized stage.  And you are going to say, oh, they were so loving.  They had such a good heart.  There was a beautiful person in there.  If somebody would just love them enough, it would come out.  And then you start missing them.  And guess what?  They show up with a text saying, how are you doing?  And it's back on.  So you know what the word hoovering means?  Hoovering is a vacuum cleaner.  So what they are, this is a technical term in narcissistic relationships.  And it just means that when you say no to them, they are going to try to suck you back in.  And they are going to go back to love bombing you.  Hastily having they own you, mirroring, being super nice, charming, bringing flowers, sending the most beautiful texts in the world, all kinds of things.  Now what happens at this stage is what we call dosing.  They do not go fully back to the idealized stage.  They just give you enough dose of it to make you think that they are serious about changing this time.  So that they get another chance.  Guess what mr hoover just sucked you back in and the vacuum cleaner worked so the dosing is basically to get past the current crisis so what they see is you saying we are over breaking up they do not see that at the end it's just we are having a few problems we are in a bit of a crisis here i better change my game for a little bit to get us past the crisis so that they want to be with me again now a lot of people who have not realized that they are with a narcissist they keep believing mr hoover and all of his tricks and they get sucked in again and then they get devalued again and discarded again and then another crisis and he hoovers you again and you get sucked in again and it just goes round and round and round until you finally clue in this is a narcissist this is not some little boy who just needs somebody to love him this is a sick person who is refusing to look at his stuff he changes just to get past the crisis and then he goes back to the other thing which is the real him the masks come off again and so that is the normal pattern that takes place so rule number one is if you have rejected some a narcissist because they continue to devalue you discard you do not take them back as soon as they hoover you and you take them back you have trained them that their hoovering will work the next time you take them back you are training them that your no does not mean no and it's only going to be more difficult the next time and so what I tell people this all the time do not say no to a narcissist do not say it's over to a narcissist until you have the backbone to stick to it because if you say no but do not have the backbone and he can hoover you back in you are making it worse for yourself But then, here's what I would like you to take into consideration To this very point we do this in our school or more in our college, ever since life started All young men and women go through this complicated process increase in size, see noque, and fear drunk i am elusive do not move the line in the sand do not say if you hit me one more time I am done that's my line in the sand and then they hit you again you say I will give you one more chance do not do that if they do not respect your boundaries they never will understand that so here's what I want you to understand shame works on your limbic brain guess what a codependent relationship is about the limbic brain what is a narcissist about the limbic brain you have to go to your cortex brain and say what are the facts about this guy my limbic brain says I am still in love he's saying I am changed I am changing and he's giving me all these gifts nice things and he's making me feel in love my limbic brain is on fire but let's shut that down what are the facts this guy has not respected my boundaries this guy continues to disrespect me this little hoovering thing always gets dropped and he goes back to the ways those are the facts I am going with facts not with my feelings and that is so hard to do but so very important to do let me make a couple observations about ending a relationship with a narcissist number one you will probably be replaced quickly and it probably will not be done very nicely so you will feel humiliated you are going to have your reputation smeared on Facebook and all kinds of things that is so painful but that is what happens do not be surprised by that but what can happen in you is it creates a lot of fear because you have seen the true colors now they may have even threatened you as a way to get you back and so you are full of fear because you have seen the real them and be prepared for that but more than just fear the next one thing I want you to be prepared for even more you are going to feel a roller coaster of emotions you are going to miss him you are going to love him and hate him you are going to be afraid of him you are going to want him back you are going to just be all over the map be ready for that and do not act impulsively on any of those things you might go into depression and then the next minute I am so glad I got rid of that jerk all up and down you are going to have a hard time explaining to yourself what was wrong because you do not even know yourself yet they have given you nothing but lies and distortions about what was wrong and so your brain's going to spin trying to figure out what was wrong and you might not figure that out for a long time and then you are going to be breaking down and crying one minute full of anger another super irritable missing them and you are going to be why am I a basket case right now what's going on here so you are going to be confused is part of it and then you are going to feel very misunderstood by friends and family they do not get a narcissist they do not get why you are so upset they do not get why you did not leave sooner all of those things are going to hurt and you are going to feel very much alone then that confusion that we talked about but then you are going to see that you have moved on but you are having trouble moving on and that's going to hurt and that's going to be confusing and then you are going to be your shame is going to go to a new level because you are so embarrassed why did I get sucked in by this guy why do I always pick jerks what's wrong with me and and that's going to take place and then you are going to get well-intentioned people do one of two things just get over it or you know what he was a really nice guy why do not you give him another chance because they never saw anything except the mass and so you are going to get all of that and bottom line is you are going to go through a time where you just do not want to be around people you are not feeling understood you are you are going to you are embarrassed and you are going to want to isolate and cut yourself off that's dangerous because what you are doing is feeding loneliness feeding too much time in your head and that could set you up to let Mr Hoover take you and suck you back in so that is a codependent pattern of relationships okay last week we talked about so what I have been doing is some of the things that we are doing from school things for life we are helping pregnant young women who this type of socializing and which are called puts Christian families kind of addressing child care while their planet's not growing it helps them tell their story and it actually takes them strong along to kind of getting an eye on God we talked a little bit about this future development because may be a little bit less than a month.  We are going to talk about like.  The signs of a practical approach.  Yes.  And.  Because they go, if God's in control, why did he let me be sexually abused?  Why did not he stop it?  I thought he was a loving God.  And so that concept of God being in control is very confusing.  So last week I tried to show you that God gave humans a free will.  And that's the only way that love is meaningful, is if you do it out of choice, out of free will, and given other possible subjects of that love.  So God gave us free will, but then God said, if I am going to give them free will, I cannot intervene.  I cannot interfere.  I have to let them make good decisions as well as bad, and live with the consequences of that.  So that is painful to begin to understand, is that we do have free will.  God has restricted his involvement in the world around us.

But then I ended by saying, there's a certain mystery to this.  And that is that somehow God can still bring good out of bad.  And so I said I would tell you a story tonight about that.  And it's a story, there's a book in the Bible, about halfway, little before halfway, called the book of Esther.  It's a very short book.  It's a book about a Jewish girl who was an orphan.  We do not know how mom and dad died, but we do know she was an orphan.  And she lived with her cousin who was much older than her.  So he became like a surrogate father.  Why that was important is because they came out of a battle where their country was conquered.  So she was taken as a hostage from Israel to modern-day Iran, which was then known as Persia.  And so her parents might have been killed in the war, but she comes as a girl orphaned into a strange country.  As a hostage where she does not know the language or the customs.  And so her life in the early days has a lot of pain.  Her uncle or our cousin Mordecai is able to get a good job.  And so he rises as far as a governmental position.  And so we are going to kind of look into all of that story.  So there's four main characters, Esther and Mordecai.  And then the king of Iran was a guy named Zerubbabel.  And his right-hand man was a guy named Haman.  And those are going to be key people to understand.  And I will develop that.  So the key points, there's two key points.  Number one, Haman is an anti-Semite in the lines of Hitler.  He wants to see all Jews killed.  So his goal as the right-hand man to the most powerful man in the world is to get the Jewish people destroyed.  And then the second key point is as you read the book of Esther, God is not mentioned once.  That's significant because the point is this.  It looks like God is totally uninvolved.  Here's a crazy man who hates Jews, who gets the king to give him permission to destroy all Jews.  And you go, where are you, God?  Why are not you stopping this?  And God does not seem to do a thing.

But then as you read the book, you go, man, there's a lot of coincidences in this book.  And you go, like I say to people, is it odd or is it God?  When you get a coincidence.  And when you get too many coincidences, you start to go, somehow there's God in here doing something.  I do not fully understand it.  So here's what you are going to see.  God is not going to violate one thing.  He's going to do one human decision.

But somehow, He is going to stop the destruction of the Jews and bring good out of all of this mess.  And so that's what I want to show you tonight.  It's a fascinating story.  And I hope I can do it justice.

The next thing that I want you to see is Esther.  If you were to look at the early part of her life, it was complex trauma, trauma big time.  Everything in her life was full of tragedies.  And I think as a young Jewish girl who grew up hearing about the God of Israel, she could have easily become cynical and bitter and jaded and rebellious and say, I want nothing to do with that.  He has not helped me.  He has not been here for me.  And so this girl, I think, went through a time where she was probably struggled with bitterness or became very bitter towards God, was convinced He was not trustworthy, and that maybe He did not even love them, that He had abandoned them.  And so she's got a crisis of faith in the midst of all of her trauma.  And the final thing I want you to see is a key point is a phrase that says, for such a time as this.  And so what Mordecai is going to say to Esther one day, Esther, do you think that all of the stuff of your life, all of the tragedies, all of the things that happened to you that you have been through, that you hated, do you think that maybe God was somehow orchestrating that, though we do not understand, to prepare you for such a time as this?  And I am going to explain what that time is.  So big, big picture.  Way back in Genesis 3, God said after Adam and Eve rebelled against God, they listened to Satan.  God said to Satan, someday I am going to send my Messiah to crush you.  And then in Genesis 12, Satan's listening because God says to a guy named Abraham, that guy that's going to crush Satan is going to come from you.  In other words, the guy that's going to crush Satan is going to be a Jew.  So guess what Satan wants to destroy is the Jewish people.  And he's been working at that for years.  The whole world of anti-Semitism.  And so what adds to the complication is not just that Satan wants to destroy the Jews, that Haman now as his messenger goes to Xerxes.  And what you have to understand is Xerxes was the most powerful man in the world.  Persia at that time ruled the world.  And Xerxes made a law that if he signed a law, it could never be undone.  So if he signed a law, an agreement with Haman to wipe out the Jews, it could never be undone.  So now God does not just have an issue with Satan.  He's got to deal with the most powerful man.  And guess what Haman gets him to do?  Sign a law to wipe out the Jews.  And so if you are a spectator, you go, God, you got a big problem here.  I do not know how you are going to pull this off.  It is looking totally impossible.  It is impossible to ever prevent the total destruction of the Jewish people.  So that's the big picture.  Now let me show you all of the coincidences.  Okay, so we are going to start with Xerxes.  And we have to understand about Xerxes.  And they found an inscription in Iran from Xerxes where he said, I am the sun.  I am the brightest star in the universe.  I do not want to negate any human Gods, I do not want you to forget your Father.  I want you to know He willeras dah.  And the world is a changing place.  This movement is, is the best possible, the best possible course of eternal creation.  Yes, the world is changing.  The wine glasses and they are all going to be made out of solid gold.  So people are going to be drinking wine out of solid gold.  What is he doing?  Are you impressed with me yet?  Are you impressed with me yet?  He is putting on the most extravagant show and display of wealth that we can imagine.  And then what they had in Persia or Iran was a law that if you were invited to a banquet by the king is there would be a bouncer who would be watching how much drink you, wine you drank.  And once you reach the limit, you are cut off.

But what Xerxes says is there's going to be unlimited alcohol.  You can drink as much as you want.  Not a good place for addicts.  And I am going to bring the best food from all over the world.  And it lists all the different types of food, exotic food, amazing food.  And then after a half year, he opens it up to the all-encompassing king.  And he's going to be watching how much wine you drink.  And once you reach the limit, you are cut off.

But what Xerxes says is there's going to be unlimited alcohol.  You can all the people of the country.  And for a whole week, they get to eat and drink like they have never eaten drank before.  So that is what he's done.  So he makes this decision to show off basically.  Okay.  Then when everybody's drunk and all the people of the nation are there in that final week on the final day, everybody is drunk and he's kind of drunk himself.  And he says, we need to spice this up.  My wife is the most beautiful woman around.  I am going to tell her to come and do a little.  And we do not know what the dance was supposed to be.  We do not know if it was a pole dance with kind of nudity or if it was just showing off a little bit of her beauty.

But he wants to put his wife on display to a whole bunch of drunk men, leering men.  And his wife's name is Vashti.  And she says, no, no, nobody says no to a narcissist like Xerxes.  So he is so much more than just a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  He's a drunk man.  And he's so mad because she's making him look bad that he says, you are no longer my wife and you are no longer the queen.  And she was deposed.  So that's, that's the drama.  Okay.  So then after that, so again, there's no God, this crazy man's making all these decisions.  That's what I want you to see after that he's in a battle.  And so they are conquering territory.  They got enemies and he battle and it did not go well and he sinks into a depression he's missing vashti he's sad about the failed battle he's worried about what people are thinking about his leadership and all of a sudden in that depressed state he starts to think maybe i should get back vashti to come back and all of his advisors go oh no we cannot let him go there so they step in and they say king we have a beautiful idea for you why do not you pick a new queen and in order to do that why do not you bring in or set up a beauty contest and have every province send their most beautiful woman to the beauty contest and what's going to happen in the beauty contest is the women are going to get one year of beauty treatments skin treatment i do not know what they do for one year but they are going to do it for one year of sauna put on a beauty contest all over and that's it their work going to happen in the beauty contest is the women are going to get one year of beauty treatments skin now in terms of beautiful women i do not know but for the lack of this concept the protocol of beauty it would be great if we have had a nice change i mean if we had even people apply for that i have got some fair way of thinking i mean there was like a assemization in Jung jaan right here for for one year and these women who are already beautiful are going to go from a 10 to a 15 and then you are going to get one night with each woman to have sex and see how they perform in bed and after you have gone through all the women you can decide which is the most beautiful wonderful woman and make a new queen now that's a sick man but he says okay let's do that so they you can now imagine every province has got to have their own beauty contests and then once they get the most beautiful woman from each contest they now bring them to the great beauty contest and then one year sitting in a harem getting beauty treatments every day one night to sleep with the king now can you imagine if you were one of the women you go if he does not pick me i do not get to go home i just want to go home and i want to go home and i want can you imagine if you were one of the women you go if he does not pick me i do not get to go home i been the rest of my life sitting in that harem.  And he might call me maybe once or twice in the rest of my life for sex when he's bored, but my life is going to become really dull.  Esther got picked to be in the beauty contest.  So that means that this young girl, Esther, is a hot looker.  She is beautiful.  Now I suspect that she probably at times resented that she was so good looking because she got a lot of undesirable attention from men.  And so she gets brought into this big beauty contest.  Okay.  So that's happening.  So that's Xerxes.  Okay.  Next person is Haman.  And he has this Mordecai guy.  And Mordecai is a guy that sat at the city gate.  He's a gatekeeper, kind of security guard.  And so every day as the big wigs went into the palace, they went by Mordecai's gate.  So he kind of the most important gate to be a security guard.  And so whenever Haman came, everybody else bowed down to him because he was Xerxes' right-hand man, not Mordecai.  He was a devout Jew and he would only bow down to God, never a man.  And that just rankled Haman because he was a narcissist too.  You had two narcissists working together here.  And so what?  It just bugged.  And bugged him and bugged him and bugged him and bugged him.  So finally, he is so full of hate towards the Jews based on Mordecai's treatment.  He goes to the king and he says this, how would you feel, king, if you knew there was a group of people who did not respect you or follow all of your traditions and laws?  The king said, I would not like that.  He says, well, there is a group of people like that.  Now they were probably some of the best citizens, but Haman, distorted it and presented it like they were rebellious, no good people.  And he says, king, if you will give me permission, I will wipe them all out and get rid of them.  So the king says, okay, you have my permission.  They brought out a legal document and the king signed it.

But before they signed it, Haman was a very superstitious person.  He did not know what day to pick as the wipeout date.  So he decided he was a gambler.  He decided to roll dice and he rolled dice, which are called Purim, which we get the feast of Purim if you are Jewish and you understand that.  He rolled dice and it picked a time about a year away.  And so it was announced that about a year from now on this day, everybody in Iran has permission to kill every Jew they know or see.  And that was the law signed by King Xerxes.  Okay, so that's going on.  You had Xerxes here.  You got crazy Haman here.  Doing their narcissist stuff.  You got Mordecai standing by his beliefs.

But Mordecai has something else happen.  So another little coincidence.  One day as he's standing as security guard, he overhears two men whispering.  And he kind of leans in and he hears that they are planning to kill the king.  An assassination plot.  And so he goes and he reports it to the right person.  They look into it and find out about this assassination plot.  And they go and they report it to the right person.  And they go and they report it to the right person.  And they go and they report it to the right person.  And they report it to the right person.  And these two guys are arrested and done away with.  He prevents the assassination of the king.  Nothing is done about it is just kind of written down is part of their daily ledger, that this happened and the story moves on.  Then Esther Now we come to her part of the story brought into this beauty contest.  Guess what, she wins.  And she becomes the new Queen of Iran.

Now, what you have to understand at this point point is that when she's a little girl Mordecai said do not reveal your nationality keep it a secret because there's a lot of people that do not like us so nobody knew she was a Jew so when she gets married to the queen to King and becomes the queen he does not know that she's a Jew just that she is one hot looking lady okay now we move on in the story Haman's edict is pronounced Mordecai hears about it and he is devastated because now all the Jews are going to be wiped out and so he one day throws kind of stones up at Esther's window and she looks out and he says come here he says have you heard the new edict and she goes no I am just the queen nobody tells me anything and and he says well on this date Haman has got Xerxes to sign a law that all the Jews will be killed and Esther goes that's me and so he says you know what you are the queen maybe God brought you through all of this for such a time as this to save the Jewish people and she was not possible and here's why she said that the narcissist King Xerxes nobody ever was a allowed to go and see him unless he asked them to come you could not initiate a meeting with him so Esther is being asked to initiate a meeting with the king and what would happen if a person tried to initiate a meeting with the king if he was annoyed that day he could basically right on the spot say I did not want you here kill this guy it was death sentence could be given and Esther says this so he says yes but I mean Haas is coming this is Ann W隻 love here so the wife environment is not a metaphor ahh if you in the middle of this and it's over and I tell Dr Da Cup no need to marry me I do not even impatientness no blood the cure I am and no sacrifice oh well she already rejected but I still bringing in to this matter certains who got yelled at in terms of their life taking a life sentences this is what the verse says here invited you he liked you he would take his scepter and he would hold it out to you for you to touch and that gave you permission to keep on going with the meeting and your life would be spared so esther is saying i cannot go to the king he has not wanted me for a month and i will probably die and mordecai says think about it there's too many coincidences in your life that god maybe has done all of something of this to bring you to this place to save the jewish people so esther says okay have all the jews pray for three days and fast do not eat just pray beg god to help me and on the third day i am going to go see him now you can imagine she just be trembling as she goes to see him and she goes into the room and he holds out a scepter relief and he says to her esther my queen what do you want i will give you up to half of my empire if you would like that wow that's a lot of money but you know what she says all i want is for you to come to a banquet that i want to have for you and haman and all the narcissist thinks is oh she's adoring me she wants to feed my narcissism and tell me how great i am and so yes we will come to a banquet and so they go to the banquet and they have a beautiful banquet she does it up right and then at the end of it he says again what do you want esther up to half my kingdom i will get anything you want she says come again tomorrow for a second banquet so now we switch back to haman he goes home that night and he's feeling pretty good because he just got asked to a private banquet with the king and the queen so he's floating on the clouds until he gets to the gate and he's on his way home and he's going to the banquet and he's going to the banquet and he's going to the banquet and he's going to the banquet and he's going to the gate and he mordecai does not bow down to him and all of a sudden he is mad at the world and he gets home and he says to his wife all of these wonderful things happened today and i got honored etc etc but mordecai and his wife says to him you know what you got this gallows that are sitting there where they hang people on let's set it up in the backyard and tomorrow morning go to the king and ask for permission to hang mordecai he goes that's the answer now he has a good sense of humor and is like okay i am going to go talk to the king in the morning now you have to imagine this is now a crisis okay so what's god going to do to keep mordecai alive we just look what happens xerxes goes to bed that night and for some reason he cannot sleep he tosses and he turns and finally he says somebody bring me a the diary of the history of my reign because that will put me to sleep or i am up i might as well review how great i am i do not know which one it is but that's what he does and guess which diary they pick the one about mordecai talking about the assassination attempt and he goes did anybody ever acknowledge mordecai and reward him and they look and go no nothing happened he says i need to do something about it just at that moment haman walks in wanting mordecai's death and xerxes says to haman haman i want to honor somebody really special what do you think would be the appropriate way to honor somebody i really respect and look up to so guess what haman's thinking oh he wants to honor me let's do this upright he says he should get the king's robe they should have a public parade where he rides in the with the king's horse in the king's chariot and he has all kinds of people yelling out front saying this is what happens to the man the king wants to honor and he's waiting for it and say okay go go and do that for yourself and the king says go and do that for mordecai his whole world just collapsed he puts on he puts on a parade for mordecai and he goes home that night and he says to his wife i think somebody's against me bigger than me they have a banquet the next night that night okay that's your second banquet and they have a nice banquet again and the king says to esther what is it that you want esther tell me please up to half my kingdom she says will you please save the lives of my people he goes what do you mean he says that man haman is wanting to kill all my people and the king is going what and he goes outside because he's exploding with rage and he stands out there to get some air and haman goes and he starts begging and he falls down towards esther just as the king comes back in and it looks like he's either attacking esther or he's trying to make out with esther and it takes his anger to a new level and he says this man, I got to deal with him.  And somebody whispers, you know what that man just put up in his backyard?  Gallows.  And the king says, hang him on his own gallows.  And that was the end of Haman.  And then the king said, Esther, what is this about your people?  And he says, that edict that Haman got you to sign.  He says, well, I cannot unsign it because every edict I make is for good.

But I will make a second edict.  And it will encourage people not to fight the Jews and it will give Jews permission to fight back.  And the Jewish people were saved.  Now you see in all of that story, there were thousands of individual decisions made by maniacs, by narcissists, all kinds of things that were happening.  There were things that were not even concerned about Israel happening.  A guy having a party and getting rid of his wife because she would not do what he wanted.  All of that kind of stuff.  There was even more of that.  And I think that's what's so important.  And I think that's what's so important.  And somehow, and I do not have a clue how, all of those individual out of free will decisions somehow got overturned to bring out a different result.  I do not know how God does that.

But what God has said is somehow, and you will never understand it as long as you are on this earth, I can take something that is very bleak and dark and bring some good.

But what God has said is somehow, and you will never understand it as long as you are on this earth, I can take something that is very bleak and dark and bring some good.

Let me just end by applying that to Esther.  Who did God use?  He used a young woman with a very painful past.  He used a young woman who had been orphaned, abandoned, raised in a foreign country, never felt like she fit in.  A woman that got all this attention because of her external beauty.  People did not care about her soul, they just cared about her body.  She had all kinds of things going on inside of her that were not going to let go of her.  There was a minute in her life that I was not aware of.  And there was a second minute in her life that I knew I was not helping her to take that normal look, a external human, also life-changing.  I think a lot of us are used to a sense of stepping out of our members of our Half has why Godіти people are doing this.  They are here for others.  It's real, it's live, it's錢.  When we say that in the first place, we say there's no point doing it, we are talking about building a family, building an middle ground in the First Place.  The first thing on your bank book there's focus on the asshole are you going to use, you take away all your prostitutes in America.  A person who struggles with God, and he worked with them and brought them to a place where they would trust him, and then he used them in a great way.  And that's what he still does today.
