Many believe it is the dog when he doesn't hear. Either it is because of the breed or because of the certain experiences that the dog has had so far or because it is generally difficult. But in most cases it is actually because of communication. And that is the reason why we look at four dog-dog communication situations today in more detail. And I'll show you what you can take out of the communication of sovereign dogs for your communication with your dog so that your dog can be approachable and steerable in important situations. So let's get started with the first video. What you can see here in this video is that my rye here is a stormy young dog in her movement . And the important point is that it doesn't wait long. It takes its own lead, because such a high, excited energy is cut off directly. You can imagine it like in kindergarten. A foster mother wouldn't wait for a child to panic a bit now, to drive all the other children crazy either. And here you can see how the rye is absolutely absolutely clear and determined the space of these young, excited hens. Yes, and what can we learn from it? We dog keepers, we often wait too long before we break such an excitement. And that's a very important point. We often go into the situation with the same energy, that the dog has at the moment. And I always have this image that I want to make a difference. That means I stay with my energy, with my energy with me and don't let me get stuck by the dog. And you can learn that well by consciously extending your attention to your body. I always like to take my left shoulder there, for example. But you can also take your left calf as well. The main thing is, you are not so focused now. You are connected to the dog, that you feel exactly the same as he feels right now. So you see here in the scene of the rascal, that he is strong, determined, calm and clear, determines and manages the space. And you can see that this is immediately accepted. And in fact, unfortunately, we often just want to change the behavior of the dog with classic dog behavior. That means we either want to teach the dog certain things, that he should look at my foot so that he doesn't pull anymore. Or it is worked with a water gun or other mischief, so that the dog is attached to the behavior of envy. And in both training methods, the communication of the holder is not used. And if you want a trustful relationship with your dog, then it is important not to work against the dog, by showing a completely different behavior, but by giving him feedback and learning to break down early, clearly, without desired behavior or a high excitement. And for this it is important that you learn to center your attention and keep it with you. So that you, as you are doing it now, have seen with my dog, calm and determined and clear in your communication. Let's look at the next scene. Here you see how my dog controls two young dogs. Because the bright dog was already quite rough to this quite young dog. And you see that the dog now wants to get out of the situation and the bright dog pokes him from behind. And this is exactly the moment when my dog, from a high body tension, breaks down and does not touch the bright dog. And you see that she is successful, that the bright dog adjusts her behavior. And what is totally important, what we humans can learn from it, is that a sovereign dog does not somehow become physical out of such a hindrance. Unfortunately, this is taught in some training methods. But then it's about scaring the dog. Our goal should be that the dog trusts us and feels comfortable when we are present and not just tiptoe into such a mischief behavior, because we work with trick-murder. And that is totally important to learn from the scene, that my dog does not suddenly spark in the middle, but she announces what she is about to do really well. You can imagine that when the teacher speaks to a child and says, hey Lisa, I've been watching your behavior for a while, you're exaggerating right now, please take it back now. And Lisa is happy to continue, and then the teacher would take a step closer and say, hey Lisa, I just told you that. Then Lisa can't be totally frightened, because suddenly the teacher is there in front of her. And that's just a very important point, that there is simply a warning when a dog is being obedient. And the warning often happens via body tension and shudder. And that means for us dog keepers, in fact, we can only do that when we are really there, when we are present. And so not go for a walk and spend more time with the cell phone, but really be with the dog in our leadership. And then it is totally important that we just announce with a let it go. And if that doesn't work, then we can take the step towards the dog. That would be a super fair communication. And in fact, I always experience with some trainers that they leave it completely out of the question and just work with some physical actions, because then they can't do it. Because the goal is to impress the dog in the sense of you want it to be uncomfortable for the dog. And if you look at the scene again from my dog, the goal is not that approaching her is uncomfortable for the bright dog. And that's the reason why she announces it, warns her. And then you see that she doesn't touch this young dog. And the key to a successful leadership of the dog or to acceptance of boundaries lies in the self-confidence of the person who says now, the end is now, in the clarity and in this mental strength, i.e. the ability to implement. And it's not at all about scaring the other person. It's about creating a fear or a behavior of hatred. That's the last thing we dog keepers want. And that's why it's very important to work on the presence. Because if you go for a walk with your dog in the presence and I'll give you a very important tip. Make sure you put your attention in your body. Then you have a completely different body tension. And you're with you. And that's what we always observe with dogs. Of course, they don't evaluate you like we do morally. Yes, if we people look at this scene, we could evaluate it like, how can this bright dog just be so over-the-top to the dog? The bright dog is just young and yes, exaggerates at the moment. And that's the task of us dog keepers. Just stay there, clearly present with us and just sign in, if it's important. It always takes an educator, always a guide, who just gives feedback from the outside. Because a young dog can of course hit the strings. That's not the problem. It's just important that we should be feedback givers. And the whole thing by chance, without going into such a anger or such a rage. And so that doesn't happen, it's just important that you stay with you and yes, try not to evaluate the dog morally, but just at that moment, you really understand, hey, there's a dog right now in such a playful energy. Remember how you were as a child. I think we all have as children at some point, yes, overreacted or were just a little bit over. That's just part of being young. Important is only, it just needs one who takes care of the order from the outside. And here you see a five-month-old young, energetic shepherd dog, who at that time had already poked on the leash. He had a low tolerance for frustration. He just poked very quickly on the leash, already at 30 meters, when he saw another dog. And here you see him in contact with my old dog and it's remarkable to see here that she stays the same, clear and calm. We humans, we often don't have that much patience. We say, let it go once, maybe let it go twice and the third time, then most people already flip out. And especially when your dog is young, energetic, he just needs an opponent, that doesn't get into such an overreaction. And you can see that here in my dog very nicely. I actually always have the picture that what she does is a giving. That means she doesn't go against the behavior. Unfortunately, we humans tend to do that. The behavior of the dog does not suit us at the moment. And we just don't understand that at the moment, because we are just frustrated, that he just has a lot of energy now and he just lacks the feedback from an older dog how to take back. And that's what my dog is now bringing to him. That means, all these breaks are gifts, that's feedback for this young shepherd dog. And she just brings him to take care of the rooms of others. We children, so when we were children, we guaranteed to pull some people to the hair. And there it just needs a feedback. There it just needs feedback. Hey, that hurts me. And that's the same with a young, dynamic dog. Quite often I actually experience that just the energy-charged, stormy dogs have had the bad luck so far that they have been faced with nobody who can give them the water. And that's what I mean what we could see here in this scene. So, one opposite, and you can do that too, or you should do that too as a dog keeper, who does not lose patience so quickly, but when the dog has especially many skills and is particularly energetic, then we just say it again and again and again. And that's what I mean that we are at the ball, we give the dog feedback, a feedback for what he is doing on the day. And if he is particularly strong in execution, then we are a little bit more effective in execution. That means, leadership is a service. And to keep a dog also means responsibility. And at that moment, to have understanding for a dog who tests the limits, who is able to keep up with the dog and who has experienced too few limits and to stay patient at the ball. That means the motto or what we can learn from here is really the feedback. That should be a role model. We don't want to put such an excitement in the young dog, but just the energy that is transferred. And that is so important. Many don't even have any understanding that the energy also makes something in the opposite. And we all know all such situations that someone is totally excited and wants to tell us a story and we lose the patience. Yes, because the energy does something with us. And everyone knows a meeting with a person who feels totally pleasant because this person is in line with him and just calm. Yes, and what we can learn from this scene now is that leadership is a service and yes, especially if you have a stormy energy-charged dog, yes, you have a role model. That means if he simply asks for limits with a lot of energy, you stay present and calm. Because only by doing so can you keep the dog calm and calm and calm and calm and calm with the length and time you could keep the dog calm and calm. Indeed, or if you have this attitude, there I am. You need boundaries and there they are. That means this energy is so important. How do you meet your dog when he is just a little bit more through and not to have the help of a mantra. My mantra with my dog was at the beginning the step and when the sun sets that has totally helped me to be in the absolutely will power. So my tip is to find a mantra and that you really feel, that raid then you become a Helm in the cobra fire. Your dog will definitely be thankful to you. And your limits will be accepted much faster as one feels that you are strong enough. Unfortunately, this is not the way dog�� ни in this regard believes, like a real dog. A person who has to go to work with filmmakers in every every article as he will just say really absolutely willfully strong in the moment you are. And now we come to the last scene. Here you see my rascal playing with his daughter. However, she now comes up with the idea of ​​putting her tat on his back and that is quite cheeky in dog communication. It is a dominant gesture. The father cannot accept that. You see that he breaks the behavior directly and the exciting thing is just here really this, I call it the head energy to see and this head energy is a clarity of roles. It really is a I know who I am and I know what is up to you and that is not up to you, my dear. So you see this willpower , if he does that, you can also observe here that he does not touch her and above all you can see in the behavior of the young hens that the positions are clarified and that is the right ingredient for acceptance, so that we can not clarify the relationship when it comes to a hard-on-hard, who should what, but that must be done in advance by communicating in everyday life that we are the decision-makers. That is, in other words, in this scene you could see very well that through this clarity whoever is where the young hens immediately go into the humility communication, which is why the father also directly adjusts his behavior. That is, in other words, this clarity is what the hens produce very quickly, namely right from the start when they come into contact, because they need that so that if there is such a small communication situation, I'll call it now, that it does not escalate there, but that one looks bad and the other says yes, that's right, sorry. This role clarity is very often missing in human behavior. That is, very often our dog is our best friend and we miss what we see here with the father, this natural authority and many actually have a tendency, they don't want to act dominantly towards the dog, but the important point is this relaxed relationship, this clarity, that there is a practical break-up with the father and so on. And then the daughter says sorry. We also need that in the leadership of our dog and that is only possible by accepting our role as decision-makers. It is sometimes the case that we know where cars are, where the roads are, that we know the dangers in our world and the dog does not. That is the reason why we are simply in the responsibility to set boundaries. That is, if we are in the position of the dog to be responsible for the behavior of the dog, then we are in the position of the dog to be responsible for the behavior of the dog. If we do not yet have such a role clarity and the dog is actually more our baby, our child, who is only the best buddy and we cannot add to that and I am the one responsible, then there is no such role clarity and then it is more of a discussion between man and dog, because the dog is not in the role that he can accept the limits of people. And that is the reason why it is very often before we are effective in communication with the dog, so basic conversations are needed, i.e. a change in the way we deal with the dog at home, so that we can work out a different understanding of roles, so that we can work out a different understanding of roles. And the dog also experiences that we are decision-makers. So we have now looked at four different dog-dog communication situations. And in the next part it will be particularly exciting, because there I will show you how you can optimize communication with your dog very concretely. Because I accompany a customer on the way, how she manages to walk relaxed with her two stormy dogs, i.e. how the lines hang through without the two dogs just pushing them through the opposite direction. So we have now looked at four different dog-dog communication situations. And the whole thing, body language, that is, the focus in this coaching is the optimization of her body language communication. and the whole thing, body language, that is, the focus in this coaching is the optimization of her body language communication.
