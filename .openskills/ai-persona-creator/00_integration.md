# How to Apply All 7 Frameworks

## Integration Process

1. **Start with Kahneman**: Identify if System 1 or System 2 dominates
   - If System 1: Focus on emotional reassurance
   - If System 2: Provide data, but know emotion still lurks

2. **Layer in Cialdini**: Which persuasion levers work on this person?
   - Rank all 6 principles
   - Focus on top 2

3. **Apply Voss**: What are they NOT saying?
   - Surface statements → Hidden needs
   - Use tactical empathy phrases

4. **Consider Navarro**: What behaviors signal comfort vs stress?
   - Predict stress triggers
   - Design approach to minimize discomfort

5. **Factor Ariely**: What irrational patterns apply?
   - Use relativity, free effect, expectations

6. **Understand Evolution**: What primal drive is active?
   - Survival threat? Status threat? Tribal dynamics?

7. **Map Organization**: Who really decides?
   - Build coalition
   - Navigate politics

## Weighted Importance by Situation

### High-stakes, fear-driven decisions (e.g., security approvals):
- Evolutionary (30%): Survival threat, status loss
- Kahneman (25%): Loss aversion, System 1 dominance
- Organizational (20%): Political cover needed
- Voss (15%): Hidden fear of blame
- Cialdini (5%): Authority, social proof
- Navarro (3%): Stress management
- Ariely (2%): Minimal rational decision-making

### Investment/ROI decisions (e.g., budget approvals):
- Kahneman (30%): System 2 analysis, but biases remain
- Organizational (25%): Stakeholder alignment critical
- Cialdini (20%): Social proof, authority matter
- Ariely (15%): Relativity, comparisons key
- Voss (5%): Some hidden agendas
- Evolutionary (3%): Moderate status concerns
- Navarro (2%): Less emotional

### Routine operational decisions:
- Kahneman (40%): System 2 analytical process
- Organizational (30%): Follow standard procedures
- Cialdini (15%): Some influence tactics
- Others (15%): Minimal
