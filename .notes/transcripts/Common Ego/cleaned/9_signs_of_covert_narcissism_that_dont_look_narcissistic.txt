So our relationship with a narcissist is a lot like buying a house with a foundation problem.  On the surface, everything looks solid, but the longer you stay, the shakier it becomes.  So in this video, I am going to walk you through nine signs of covert narcissism that do not really look so narcissistic at all on the surface.  So you can see the foundation problem for what it is before it all starts to crack beneath you.  My name is Christina and I help people make sense of the chaos narcissists leave behind so they can stop second guessing themselves and finally move on.  And if you are still not sure about what's keeping you stuck, I created a free quiz that can help.  It's designed to show you exactly where you are in the recovery process and what to focus on next.  You will find a link for that in the description.  So let's start with the first sign because it's one that usually flies under the radar.  And by the time you recognize it, it's already started to chip away at your sense of reality.  They downplay things that hurt you.  So maybe you bring something up and it's something small, but you know, it's stuck with you.  And instead of owning it or hearing you out, they naturally brush it off.  They might say you are being dramatic or that's not what I meant.  And sometimes you get the full out gaslighting.  That's you are not actually upset.  You are just trying to make me feel bad.  So somehow through all of this, they become the authority on your feelings.  I do not know how that works, but somehow for them, it does.

But through all of it, it does not sound angry.  It sounds, it's calm.  Like they are just setting the record straight.  And the dangerous part is then you find yourself backpedaling.  So maybe you are explaining your tone or justifying your reaction.  You are trying to prove that, yes, you really were hurt, even if it seems like it was not a big deal.  And this is where the shift starts, because now you are not talking about what they did.  Instead, there's a group effort managing how much pain you are allowed to feel.  And there you are working overtime to sound reasonable so they do not flip it back on you.  And in the middle of all of this, you are trying to prove that you are not hurt.  And you are trying to you are trying to prove that you are not hurt.  And in the middle of all of this, you are trying to you are trying to prove that you are not hurt.  And you are trying to it seems easier to just let it go.

But over time, you start feeling like you are walking through a space that's delicate.  Not because anything's shattered just yet, but because the damage keeps showing up in the same spot.  So now you are moving differently.  Not because you are fragile, but because the relationship is.  You are watching your step, trying not to press too hard or speak too loudly.  We are definitely trying not to need too much.  Because you have been here before.  You are not going to be there.  You are not going to be there.  You are not going to be there.  And the last time you spoke up, they turned it around on you.  And that's the crack in the foundation.  It's not the disagreement itself, but the way they rewrite it to make you feel like you are the problem.  And the longer you stay, the more normal that starts to feel.  Like maybe you are overreacting.  Or maybe this is just what relationships feel like when you are hard to love.

But it's not.  And you are not hard to love.  They just made you feel that way.  All of this is just a show.  And it's a quiet erosion of your self-worth.  So another sign of covert narcissism that does not seem so narcissistic on the surface is they turn your pain into theirs.  So maybe you are finally honest about something that hurt.  You are not blaming them.  You are just trying to be real about how something landed with you.  And instead of hearing you, they go quiet.  Or they get withdrawn.  Or they act kind of wounded.  Like you just said something really unfair.  And then suddenly, the conversation is not about what happened.  It's about how bad you made them feel.  So they might say something like, I guess I cannot do anything right.  Or I am the worst partner in the world, are not I?  And now here you are comforting them for something they did to you.  It's subtle.  And it does not always come with name calling.  It just kind of flips the emotional weight onto your side of the scale.  Like they are the ones who have been hurt the most in this interaction.  And so now they have to focus on you.

But the problem is, it works because you are empathetic.  You do not want to hurt someone you care about.  So you backpedal and you soften your words.  And the next time you might not bring it up at all.  Because somewhere along the way, the safest move became silence.  And that's another shift in the foundation.  It's not just that cracks are forming.  It's that you are starting to walk around them.  So you start arranging your words, your tone, and even your emotions around their sense of purpose.  It's about sensitivity.

But the truth is it's not real vulnerability.  It's emotional deflection.  Because instead of sitting with the impact of what they did, they make your pain about them.  And the damage that does is not loud or explosive, but it keeps you from ever really being seen.  And that makes the entire relationship feel off balance, even when everything on the surface still looks fine.  So another sign of covert narcissism that does not look super narcissistic on the surface, is that we are being a bit too open and we are kind of talking about what you are doing.  Surface is they help you in ways that actually leave you off balance.  So maybe they do something for you without being asked.  Maybe they fix something or offer a solution, or they swoop in just at the right moment to take care of it for you.  And on the surface, it looks thoughtful.  You should feel supported, but instead you kind of feel displaced.  Like imagine somebody rearranged your kitchen while you were out, and now you are supposed to be grateful that they saved you from this mess that you did not actually have.  And now you have no idea where anything is and everything feels like chaos.

But at the same time, you are supposed to thank them.  And if you do not thank them, if you do not respond in the way they expect, suddenly you become ungrateful or difficult or impossible to help.  So next time you smile and you play along and you tell yourself it's fine.  Maybe they were just trying.

But deep down, something has shifted because the message was not, I have got your back.  It was you needed.  Me to step in.  And that's what slowly breaks your trust in yourself.  Because now every time you try to take the lead, they are already one step ahead, offering a fix you did not ask for and making sure you know how much easier they made your life.  And this is where the house metaphor really starts to sink in.  No pun intended.  You thought you were building something together, but somehow you have ended up in a space that does not quite feel like yours anymore.  You are living in their version.  You are living in the room of support and constantly rearranging your comfort just to keep the peace.  So another sign of covert narcissism that is not obvious upfront is when they quietly withhold warmth.  So maybe you push back on something or you disappoint them in a way that was not even intentional and they do not blow up.  They do not even argue.  They just kind of drop out.  So the tone changes and the energy is completely different and you feel it.  Have not said a word.  And maybe that's the part that gets to you the most because it's not always so subtle.  Sometimes it's quite obvious, like they are making a point by stepping back, but not giving you anything solid to respond to.  So now you are trying to fix something that you cannot name and you start wondering if you were too harsh or too cold, or maybe just said the wrong thing.  And before you know it, you are softening your tone.  You are checking your words.  You are working to bring the warmth back in, even though you are not the one who turned it off.  And that's the pattern because they do not need to fight you directly.  All they need is to go quiet long enough for you to start chasing that closeness again.  And you will because you have felt the warmth before and you know what it's like when it's there.  That's how it becomes control.  It's like the heat's technically on, but the room never warms up.  And instead of asking why, you just keep layering up.  You keep adjusting.  And you keep blaming yourself for the cold.  So another sign of covert narcissism that's not so obvious in a relationship is they make you feel that the issue is how you said something.  So maybe you bring something up calmly and clearly.  You have probably rehearsed it in your head to make sure it's fair and reasonable, probably a million times over.  And somehow it still does not land.  So they act confused or they say you are being too intense or they pick apart your tone or wording instead of explaining it.  And that's when you start to feel the warmth back in.  And that's when you start engaging with the actual point.  And suddenly the conversation's about how you said it or the words you chose.  And it's not about the topic at all.  And you find yourself explaining things that should not need explaining.  Simple things, human things, like why you felt hurt or why it's not okay to be dismissed, but they just keep twisting it.  So you try again and again.  Thinking maybe if you just say it the right way, they will finally get it.

But they never do.  And then it's like a vicious cycle.  And you do not know what to do.  And then you do because that's not their goal the thing is they are not confused they are actually dodging and the more you explain the more lost you are going to feel and over time you stop bringing things up all together not because you do not care but because you are tired of feeling like nothing makes sense anymore and that confusion is absolutely the point for them because as long as you are doubting how you are saying it you will never get to why it needed to be said in the first place so another sign of covert narcissism that shows up in a relationship but is not always obvious is they forget things that do not benefit them so maybe you circle back to a conversation you know you had something they said or something they promised maybe something that really mattered to you and they act like it never happened so naturally you will get the i do not remember saying that you must be thinking of something else or that's not what i meant and now you are not just hurt you are defending your memory and you are finding yourself digging through old texts and reading messages trying to find proof that you are not making this up because you know you are not but the more they deny the more you start to wonder if maybe you misunderstood or maybe you just wanted to hear something they never actually said and this is how it works they do not erase the story just the parts that hold them accountable and every time they do they repaint over the same wall like the crack was never there in the first place like you imagined it and the fact that you keep trying to prove what actually happened is not about clarity that's survival because when the people around you keep rewriting the past you start to lose your footing in the present so another way covert narcissism shows up in a relationship that's not super obvious is that the narcissist is warm in public but cold in private so when other people are around they are charming thoughtful engaged and they smile when they talk to you maybe they make jokes they touch your shoulder like you are close and to everyone else it looks like you are lucky it looks like the relationship is solid but then you get home and everything shifts then they are quiet or distant or they are just not interested and it's not just one bad day and it's not necessarily that there's even a reason it's that there's warmth when people are watching and coldness when they are not interested it's not about being a bad person it's about the fact that you are a good person and that you are a good person and that you are good for someone else so you are a good person and that's why i am sure that you have to be a good person because you are a good person they are not and that split starts to wear on you because when the house looks pristine from the outside no one would imagine that the basement floods every time it rains so you start wondering if maybe you are the problem maybe you are expecting too much but you are not you are just noticing the gap and that's the danger of this kind of covert behavior it does not just make you feel unseen it makes you feel crazy for seeing what no one else can so another sign that covert narcissism is present that is not super obvious is that you are always tired but there's no obvious reason so maybe nothing huge has happened you have not had some explosive fight you may have not said anything that's outright cruel but you are tired and you cannot quite explain why not tired like you need a nap tired like your brain does not stop scanning for what mood they are in tired like you are constantly trying to say the right things in the right way so it does not set something off even though half the time you do not even know what that something is and maybe people around you would not get it because everything looks fine you are still functioning the relationship looks normal but you do not feel normal you feel off on edge kind of like you are walking around with a low battery all the time and you do not even remember when it started draining and here's the thing there's no big collapse there's no breaking point no emergency per se but that does not mean there's no damage because now you are constantly maintaining things that should not need maintaining you are keeping the peace you are filling in the emotional gaps explaining things to yourself that do not actually make sense just so you can stay upright in a space that never really lets you rest it's like the house is still standing but only because you are running around with duct tape and drywall mud trying to keep the place livable and you do not even know when that became your job you just know that that's not what you are doing and that's why you are not keeping things that are important to you right now you are not keeping things that are important to you right now you are not keeping things that are important to you right now you are not keeping things that are important to you right now you are not keeping things that are important to you right now you are tired and the worst part is you have started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel tired and the worst part is you have started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel like so like so another sign of covert narcissism that is not obviously narcissistic on the surface is that they tell you what they want to hear but they never follow through so maybe they say exactly what you have been wanting to hear that they are going to change that they finally understand how much this has affected you or that things will be different and in the moment it feels real like you can finally exhale but then time passes and nothing happens happens, or the story changes, or maybe they act like you misunderstood what they meant.  And when you bring it up, they twist it.  They say, again, I never said that, or that's not how I remember it.  And now you are stuck between what they said and what they are doing, between what you felt and what they are pretending never happened.  This is future faking.  It's giving you just enough hope to keep you emotionally invested, but never enough follow through to actually build anything real.  So to bring it back to the house analogy, it's like they sketch out this beautiful renovation, right?  And they promised the upgrades, the lighting in this space.

But when it's time to show up and start the work, they disappear.  And you are left in the same old house holding blueprints that were never meant to be followed.  And maybe the hardest part is you were not asking for fantasies.  You just wanted something solid and something honest.

But when someone keeps promising a future they have no intention of creating.  What they are really doing is buying time.  While you keep living in a house that was never going to be finished.  So maybe it did not look toxic at first.  Maybe there were no screaming matches, no obvious threats.  Maybe there were just quiet shifts, confusing moments and little betrayals that did not feel like betrayals at the time.  And that's exactly why covert narcissism is so hard to see, because the damage does not hit all at once.  It builds slowly.  Underneath the surface.  Until one day you realize you are exhausted, doubting yourself, and living in something that does not feel safe anymore.  And if any part of you is still trying to explain it away, if you are still questioning whether it really counts as betrayal, watch this video next.  It will help you name the things they hoped you would never see clearly.  And be sure to hit that like button before you go if you have not already.  And I will see you again soon.
