 Welcome to another Friday night, we've been going through a series where we're taking a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma and today we come to one that we call people from complex trauma create what they hate or they create what they're trying to avoid or they create the opposite of what they want to happen and it happens all the time and a common question is why do I do that?  So before I answer that let me just kind of set the stage by painting this backdrop people from complex trauma grow up in environments where there's lots of danger or where their needs aren't met or where there's many violations of love so there's lying there's abuse there's not there isn't justice all of those things are happening they hate that aspect of their childhood  and they never want to see that happen in their life again they want their needs met etc and so they they start out with the determination I'm never going to be abandoned again I'm never going to be disrespected again I'm never going to be lied to again and then they move into adult life and they end up being abandoned again and disrespected again and it happens over and over so they create without realizing it the way they want to do it  realizing it the very environment that ends up creating what they've been trying to avoid or the thing that they hate so let me give you a couple examples just to help you understand it  so somebody that's been abandoned goes that is the worst emotional experience to go through being abandoned makes you feel like you don't matter at all I never want that to happen again  so they get in a relationship determine that they'll never be abandoned but what they then do is they're super needy or they test the person all the time or they try to control the person all the time  and after a while the other person goes I'm done with this and they walk out of the relationship and the person feels abandoned again or I've had so many people say to me I grew up and I said I'm never going to be like my dad  my dad was an addict my dad had anger issues my dad was in jail periodically and they are determined not to become their dad  and when they hit adult life they're an addict they're in jail and they got anger issues or I don't want a husband like my last husband  so I'm going to find a new husband who's not going to be like my last husband and they date and they end up married to somebody that they think is totally opposite of their last husband  and then they find out he's very much like their last husband or I don't want my kids to make the same bad decisions that I made  and so they start out in parenting to try to make sure their kids don't repeat their mistakes and they find out 15, 20 years later that their kids have made the same decisions that they made when they were a teenager  they created what they were trying to avoid what they hate they created the opposite of what they wanted  so why is that?  well let me give you some reasons because there's many different factors that can come to play on why we create what we hate  so the first one is a hyper need so when a need is not met in a child they can go in two different directions extremes  they can try to shut that need off and we'll get back to that in a minute or it can create a hyper need I needed I wanted I wanted I wanted I wanted  and so let me give you a couple examples let's say a child was not validated and we all have a need to be validated  and so when they come to their teen years and adult life they have this hyper need of wanting to be validated  so they chase people around was I good enough was I good enough they're always looking for applause for pots on the back  and what happens with that hyper need people get tired of having that person always looking for validation and they stop giving them validation  so the child has a hyper need for validation because they never got it as a child but what they end up as creating is nobody wants to give them validation exactly what happened when they were a child  or let's say a person who was never heard whenever they tried to explain or give their opinion nobody listen to them  so now they're going I need to be listened to so whenever they're in a conversation they over talk they over explain they talk too much  they but in to get heard and after a while people enough with this person I'm not even listening to them  so now they're not heard again they created what they are trying to avoid or a person who was never understood nobody took the time to understand where they're coming from  so that hurts and now today they go I need to be understood and so now they over explain everything whenever they think somebody doesn't understand them  they chase them around saying let me explain let me explain let me explain and pretty soon people are tired of that  and so now they end up not being understood again because nobody wants to listen to their never ending explanations  or let's say a child was made to feel stupid all the time so now they think the thing that I need to do in order to not be perceived as stupid  is to give very academic answers to share my opinion all the time but after a while people go I'm tired of listening to this person and they get treated as if they're stupid again  so that can happen over and over so those that hyper-need situation can set a person up to not get that need met  exactly what happened when they were a child but then there's another part to this need thing so sometimes when you shut that need off  you don't even think it's a need and you just think you have other needs but you don't understand that that deep, deep need trumps all of the lesser needs in your life  let me give you an example let's say that you were rejected and abandoned that hurts like crazy but you just shut that off and you basically went to I don't need people  I don't care about people I'm going to isolate I'm never going to let people see the real me I am going to wear mass  I am going to put up walls so that nobody can get close enough to hurt me again and so you think my need is to be self-sufficient my need is to be liked by people and to wear mass and to have walls  and not be authentic all of those things those are my needs but you don't understand that your deep, deep need is to connect to be authentic  and so you live in isolation but now you feel a deep loneliness a deep longing to be loved those two deep needs of connection and love are not being met by your solution to never being rejected or abandoned again  and that desire to be loved will cause you to seek out relationships it will cause you to miss red flags in relationships and get into relationships with unsafe people and before you know what you're getting hurt and abandoned and rejected again  so not understanding the deep, deep needs of the human being needs that many have turned off because of early wounds those still will ultimately trump everything else  another one that I see all the time is a person who grows up with a family where they're constantly shamed made to feel like they don't matter like they're stupid etc  and so they go I don't need I don't need that validation I don't need all these different needs met but what they don't realize is they have this deep, deep longing to be validated by their family  deep, deep longing to be accepted and to belong by their family  and so they go into recovery and they think all my needs are is I need to make a few friends I need to do my recovery work  but they don't understand how deep the longing is for their family to validate them and accept them  and they keep running back to their family for validation and they keep getting shamed the very thing they don't want  they ended up creating because they didn't understand that deep need  now there's another need kind of variable here that is important understand  in the case of sexual abuse for a young child it awakens a drive before kind of the plan time the natural time when it would be awakened  so the sex drive normally awakens 11, 12 years old but let's say a child's molested at 5 or 6  what can happen when you you have that drive awakened before the plan time is again a child going two different directions  they just hate sex turn it off it's a dirty bad thing or they can have a hyper sex drive  and they can become promiscuous but what happened to that little child was I never want to be molested again  I never want to be sexually abused again I hate it but then because they end up with this hyper sex drive  and they're promiscuous all the time guess what happens they end up in situations where they get sexually abused again  they created what they were trying to avoid without even realizing it  now there's another reason why people create what they hate and that is because they turned off their intuition, their radar system, their gut  so for the question I get asked all the time is people from trauma end up with more trauma in their adult life than people from healthy homes who don't have childhood trauma  why is it that people from trauma end up with more trauma and I think often it's around this radar system  so consider this scenario a child is going to be going to their uncles or to their babysitters  and their gut says that person is not safe they tell their parents I don't feel comfortable with that babysitter  I don't feel comfortable with my uncle they're listening to their gut but their parents says oh there's nothing wrong with them  they go ahead and they go and they get molested  what they then do is tell their parents and their parents as you're making it up  no that really didn't happen or it's your fault whatever and they get sent to that uncle or that babysitter again  so what the child realizes is my radar system which is designed to warn me to get away from that person  I am not able to get away from that person because I'm a child and I have parents who are forcing me to go to that person  so why do I want a radar system when I can't listen to it it's just annoying to have sirens going off when I can't listen to them  so they shut down their alarm system their gut their intuition  because there's no point in having it and it's annoying  so now they get to adult life and they're going out on a date and their alarm system says red flags, red flags danger danger  but they've turned it off and they just walk into danger now and get traumatized again  the third reason why people create what they hate or end up in situations that they've been trying to avoid  is because of their default setting that they developed as a child what was their normal as a child  so for example a child grows up with a narcissist dad or a narcissist mum  and what happens with that is they hate that narcissist dad they hate that narcissist mum but that's their normal  that's all they know that's how they've learned to relate to people and that's their life  and so without realizing it they go into adult life hating narcissists but feeling the most comfortable with narcissists  being drawn to narcissists because it feels normal and ending up back in the exact situation they hated when they were a child  or many grew up in homes where they were disrespected made fun of put down they hated that but it was their normal  and so now they're drawn into situations in other relationships with people who realize I can put this person down and get away with it  and the person just takes it because that's their normal it feels normal  so they end up in situations much like their childhood just because that's where their comfort zone is  so if you consider the fact that a child growing up in complex trauma could be growing up with hundreds of unhealthy family dynamics, relationship dynamics, coping dynamics  but they don't know they're unhealthy because it's their normal and so now they go into adult life and they gravitate to what feels normal  there's a fourth one that I think is so important understand and it's to understand the power of a parent's influence  we often think that we are deeply influenced by what our parents say to us and do to us or do their actions and their words  and those are the two things only that influence us but do you realize that you are also influenced by who your parent is, by their beliefs, by their values, by their attitudes, by their fears, by their emotional make up, by their coping, by their thinking, all of those things you're picking up  you're affected by, you're influenced by without even realizing it and so your parents are like this greenhouse that incubator that puts all of this influence on you and it shapes you and forms you without even realizing it  so those things you just pick up, they become your normal, they become your autopilot, you learn to cope with like your parents did without even realizing it  you respond to stress like your parents did without even realizing it, you develop attitudes that your parents have without even realizing it  the power of a parent's influence, I can hate what they did and hate what they said but then I end up like them because I picked up all of their ways of thinking and coping their values and beliefs  that is a very hard thing to accept but it shows the power of parents' influence  let me take that further, we often when we think of procreation, think of creating a physical baby, we're going to create physical life  so we think of procreation in terms of physical life only but think of it also that in procreation I'm not just creating a physical life, I'm creating a soul  I'm creating a human being, a soul, think about that, it's really easy to create a physical life  but do you realize it's easy to create a unhealthy soul but very hard to create a healthy soul, take it further  I can create a physical life just by one act but to create a healthy physical soul takes years of consistent being healthy  influencing them, modeling for them, responding to them in healthy ways, it takes years to create a healthy soul, one act to create a physical life  and easy to create an unhealthy soul take it further to create a physical life requires only an action  to create a healthy soul requires words, actions and who I am my attitudes, my responses  if I am healthy I can create a healthy soul, if I am not healthy I cannot create a healthy soul, I will create an unhealthy soul  so procreation is more than just giving physical life passing on my genes, it's creating a soul who's like my soul  and so if I am going to pass on healthy I have to be healthy so here's one of the hard things I think for people to face when we look at create what we hate  we often think of create what we hate only in terms of doing it in my own life but what I want you to see is we create what we hate not just in our own life but also in our children  because if I don't get healthy myself I will just pass on unhealthiness and they will be like me and like their grandparents who I hated and didn't want to be like  that is a hard reality but that is what happens creating what we hate becomes a generational thing if we don't stop the cycle by becoming healthy  let me give you a fifth reason why we create what we hate and it's called cognitive dissonance  so cognitive dissonance is the psychological discomfort we feel when our mind entertains two contradictory concepts at the same time  so let me give you kind of an example of this there's what I refer to as healthy cognitive dissonance it's designed as a good thing  so you have a healthy belief that lying is wrong that stealing is wrong that is drilled into you that trains your conscience  now you consider stealing from someone and lying to someone and all of a sudden you have two contradictory things happening inside of you  and it creates this discomfort I don't like when I'm feeling right now there's this dissonance inside of me  now that was designed to be a good thing because what it is saying is if I program my conscience with healthy whenever I try to become unhealthy  there will be dissonance which will motivate me to not do the unhealthy to say I don't like how this makes me feel so I'm not going to do it  that's the healthy design but now enter complex trauma  so two different scenarios what happens in complex trauma is a child has to do unhealthy tools in order to survive  so they can be told lying is bad but in order to not get unjustly punished they got a lie about a lot of things to survive  so their conscience has been trained to not lie but they have to lie to survive so they just harden their conscience they shut it up  they don't want it chirping at them so that can happen secondly you can get a conscience that's mistrained by wrong beliefs  your family can say to you you should never say no you need to please people all the time love is never saying no to anybody  and they drill that into you and when you try to say no at times you get punished for that and so it's trained into you that never say no  but then you come into recovery and you realize that love says no love sets boundaries there are times when it is right to say no  but what does that feel like now inside your brain it is healthy is contradicting what you were raised with  you didn't know it was unhealthy but now when you want to get healthy now you got dissonance cognitive dissonance inside you  it doesn't feel good to now start saying no you now feel guilty you now feel all kinds of unrest inside of you  and so complex trauma creates a belief system of lies so that now when you want to choose the truth it creates cognitive dissonance  complex trauma mistrained your conscience so now when you want to act in healthy ways you feel cognitive dissonance  so you got to fight against that so let me give you another example let's say your experience and what your family taught you is you can't trust anybody  people can't be trusted and that was drilled into you and your experience seemed to confirm it now you come into recovery  and you go I like this person I see that I need people in my life I need to trust now when you go I think I'm going to trust this person you feel dissonance  it doesn't feel right it makes you feel really uncomfortable and so do you know what a lot of people do they sabotage healthy relationships just to get out of that  dissonance that they're feeling so here's what I want you to understand in order for you to grow in recovery and get healthy you're going to fight cognitive dissonance  and I'll come back to that in just a minute let me give you a six thing that can result in us creating what we hate  and that is we wrongly diagnose why we got hurt in the first place and then we come up with the wrong solution so that we never get hurt again  so an example you are disrespected as a child and your diagnosis is because it must have happened because I'm different I'm too emotional  I'm too sensitive so the solution is to stuff all of that down and wear masks all the time and become a people pleaser that way I'll never get disrespected again  so to a child that seems logical it seems like the right diagnosis and it seems like the right solution but it isn't because if you become a people pleaser and you never say no to anybody  and they can use you and walk all over you they may like you at first but they're going to start to disrespect you because you don't have a backbone  so the very thing you were trying to prevent being disrespected you ended up creating by a wrong diagnosis and a wrong solution  another way that this works out is what I call pendulum swing  so people say I hate my dad he had all kinds of anger issues he was an arse assist I am not going to end up with a husband like my dad  so they go out and they look for guys that seem totally opposite of their dad different personality maybe their dad was an extrovert they look for an introvert  maybe their dad was loud and emotional they look for somebody quiet  and they think I found the opposite but what they missed is the real reason for their dad's issues was not just his personality it was his shame  it was his unhilled wounds it was a whole bunch of deep deep things but they didn't know that and so they just look for an opposite personality  somebody who's not an extrovert somebody who's quiet but they end up with somebody with shame  they're drawn to shame that's their normal and they end up with somebody with a lot of shame even though he's an introvert he's still got anger issues  so the pendulum swing you think you're getting the opposite you think you're guaranteeing you're not even getting close to being like your dad  you misdiagnosed it though  another example conflict so let's say you grew up with tons of conflict conflict was never resolved  conflict always resulted in people getting hurt and you said I hate conflict I never want conflict in my relationships today  so I will become a people pleaser I will never rock the boat I will always be the one that makes sacrifices and give in  I will sweep things under the carpet and avoid talking about problem type situations and you think that will guarantee that I'll never have conflict  but it's a misdiagnosis the way to avoid conflict is to resolve it when it happens and learn from it  what you're doing by people pleasing never rocking the boat you're just piling up unresolved issues  and they keep piling up piling up until there's ongoing tension ongoing irritability and then there's an explosion  so the very thing you're trying to avoid because you misdiagnosed and you came up the wrong solution you ended up creating  let me give you one more example in this area so let's say a girl was sexually abused  in her mind she doesn't understand how it's affected her she doesn't understand all of the underlying dynamics  okay so she just goes through life never wanting to be sexually abused again  but what are her deep needs that she's not aware of she is a deep need for love a deep need for validation  a deep need to feel value but she didn't get that from her parents and she didn't realize how that affected her  but she was a very pretty girl and she found out she got lots of validation for her body for her looks  and she liked that it made her feel good it was seemed to be meeting these needs so now when she starts meeting guys  they're giving her tons of validation and she's chasing that and she's going after guy after guy looking for that validation  and what ends up she gets raped she gets abused again because she misdiagnosed what was really causing all of her problems  another one that can contribute to this creating what we hate is what we call a self fulfilling prophecy  so we have an experience we create beliefs and then we predict what we think will happen based on our experience and our beliefs  we create expectations so in a healthy family you end up with a whole bunch of things that if you're authentic  you connect that becomes your belief system and you expect if you're authentic you will connect in the future  what you need to understand is complex trauma your experiences if you're authentic you get rejected  it creates a set of beliefs that you think are true but they are lies  and so what you then do is say okay the way to get accepted is to never be authentic  so you go into all your relationships expecting that if I'm ever authentic I will get rejected  and guess what happens you go into relationships you wear masks you wear walls  you might let a little bit of yourself out and people start rejecting you because you're fake  and then you go see I tried and I got rejected  you created what you were trying to avoid let me give you another example  a young girl and this is based on a true story  whenever she gave her opinion whenever she asked a question whenever she expressed a need to her parents she was punished  she was made to feel selfish she was made to feel bad so giving her opinion expressing a need  sharing always resulted in something bad so she decided to shut down to not have any needs to never express a need  that she was just an invisible child she went to school and she had a new school teacher  and this school teacher had a real desire to form an emotional connection with each child  she was warm she was accepting she was safe she reached out to each child to understand them  to find out what interested them to connect with them but this young girl no way  if I express myself if I open up if I share I will get rejected so she would not give into this teacher  for months the teacher tried to connect with this child she was able to connect with all the other children in the class  but this one child held out would not open up would not warm up so after several months the teacher finally gave up  and just said okay this child will not let me in I will not try to push any further  and guess how that child interpreted that see everybody rejects you  that's just the way life is that just confirms my belief that everybody will ultimately reject you  and so she became even more determined to never open up again  many of you grew up with people can be trusted people will let you down  and so your belief is when you get in a relationship they're going to eventually let me down  but you go into a relationship and you're super needy and you start phoning the person in the middle of the night  you start asking if they can meet for coffee and you just push boundaries and you demand and you demand and you demand  and you basically want the person to respond to you perfectly every time and be available 24-7  and finally the person says I can't do this and set some boundaries and then you go see people let me down  I shouldn't have trusted this person you created a self-fulfilling prophecy  you were controlled by a lie and somebody has said this a lie can only control a person if they continue to believe it  somebody else has said if you expect the battle to be insurmountable which would be a lie  you have met the enemy which is you for believing that lie  okay how do we heal this how do we change how do we stop creating what we're trying to avoid  let me just give you a few practical things  so number one in light of what we said earlier you have to fight cognitive dissonance  you have to realize that your conscience has been programmed with lies and unhealthy things  that you were told were healthy so now for you to try and get healthy is going to create dissonance  it's going to create uncomfortable feelings and those can make you feel guilty  they can make you second guess yourself they can make you feel confused am I doing the right thing because it feels wrong  but that's what you have to go through in recovery until you retrain your conscience  you have to fight through cognitive dissonance now be aware that if you have a family still in your life  and you start to get healthy guess what they are going to go back to the unhealthy and say you're wrong  you shouldn't be doing that and they're going to create even greater cognitive dissonance  you're not just fighting your own internal conscience that's been mistrained  you're fighting external voices that are telling you lies so be aware of that  secondly be aware of the lies you believe be aware of the patterns that you have  and then begin to work on all of the shame because the shame is often underneath so many of our behaviors  and it's often the thing that we don't see when we try to diagnose why we do what we do  so begin to understand the depth of your shame how it has affected you so that you can heal those things  and then learn about all the other deeper issues shame abandonment  deep losses understand how they've affected you neglect abuse so that you can find healthy solutions  and you can make a healthy diagnosis that is so important and again I would encourage you  if you want more understanding to take our lift course or our react program  that will help you understand these things at a deeper level and finally you need safe people  the very reason you didn't want that part of your life anymore the reason you hated  is because unsafe people did stuff to you they abandoned you they rejected you  they disrespected you all of those things that you're trying to avoid were created by unsafe people  if you go back to unsafe people today you're going to end up getting hurt again  you need to go to safe people you need to begin to have people where you can reprogram your belief system  because now you're going to get a different result  well that's the end of part one I just hope that helps you in your journey of wanting to begin to get healthy  and not keep repeating stuff you're trying to avoid  we're going to take a short break and then we'll come back for the Christian part  if you're not interested in that not a problem we're not offended have a great weekend for everybody else to be back in a minute  so  Well, welcome back.  Last week we started a new series in this Christian part on Joseph, one of my favorite  Bible characters, the guy that is known for getting Israel through this time of famine  in the world many years ago.  But what I wanted you to see is that Joseph of all the Bible characters we know about, we  get more detail on the complex trauma that he experienced growing up.  And a lot of it was from within his own family.  And that's what I want to develop further today.  Last week we just looked at his mum and dad and we saw unhealthy things with them that  were very concerning the narcissism, the manipulation, the favoring of people, children, etc.  Today there's a couple other dynamics within his family that I just want you to be aware  of so that you can think, wow, what would it have been like to grow up with that?  And some of you go, wow, Joseph's life sounds very much like my life.  So let me begin with kind of what I call tragedy number one.  In Genesis 35 it's that Jacob and his clan moved on toward Bethlehem.  Rachel went into labor and that's Joseph's mum.  Her labor pains were intense after a hard delivery.  The midwife finally exclaimed, don't be afraid, you have another son.  But Rachel was about to die.  And with her last breath she named the baby Benoni which means son of my sorrow.  Jacob called him Benjamin which means son of my right hand.  So if you remember from last week Rachel had been unable to conceive whereas Leah, her sister,  Jacob's first wife had many children and finally she was able to conceive and Joseph  was her son.  Now she's pregnant again and is about to have a second child and dies in childbirth.  What we saw last week is that the relationship within the family there were four wives and  there was a contest on and there was all kinds of jealousy and manipulation and anger and hatred  all amongst these four women.  They didn't like Joseph because he was favored because he was the son of Jacob's favorite  wife, Rachel.  And so Rachel for Joseph, his mum was his one safe person.  It was the one person where he didn't get animosity.  He didn't get hatred and all kinds of distrust issues.  Now she's dead.  At a young age he has lost his mother which is bad enough but he's lost.  The one who was a safe person, that must have affected him greatly because now he feels  very much alone.  So let me take you to a second tragedy.  One day Dinah and that's Joseph's only sister.  The daughter of Jacob and Leah went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area  so she's out just getting to know people, teenagers.  Well in the local prince, Shekham's son of he more the hivite, Sadina, he seized her and raped her.  Then Shekham himself goes to Dinah's father Jacob and to his brothers, her brothers, and  says, please be kind to me.  Let me marry her.  So I raped her but I want to make this right.  I want to marry her and become a responsible husband.  I will give you whatever you ask, no matter what dowry or gift you demand, I will gladly  pay it just give me this girl as my wife.  So Jacob's sons respond deceitfully.  They're going to lead Shekham on with a lie.  And so they say to them, we couldn't possibly allow this because you're not circumcised.  You would be a disgrace for our sister to marry a man like you.  But here's a solution.  If every man among you will be circumcised like we are, then we will give you our daughters  and we'll take your daughters for ourselves.  He more in Shekham agreed to this proposal as did all the men in the town council.  So every man in the town was circumcised.  In other words, every man was incapacitated.  So three days later when the wounds were still sore, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi,  who were Dyna's full brothers through Leah, take their swords, enter the town without opposition  and slaughter every male there, including Haymore and his son Shekham.  In other words, they led them to believe if they were circumcised, they would give Dyna  to them.  But they were really wanting them circumcised so that they wouldn't be able to fight when  they were attacked.  And they wiped out the entire village of men.  Now, what is amazing in this is we don't find Jacob doing one thing.  He doesn't rebuke his sons.  He doesn't try to make things right with the village.  We see no sorrow, we see nothing, he sticks his head in the sand and avoids the situation  and tries to act like it doesn't exist, hoping it would go away.  Now, can you imagine how frustrating that would be for Jacob's children to see their dad  do absolutely nothing be totally passive?  I think they would lose respect for their dad.  I think they would see that he doesn't really care about people just about himself.  But what I want you to also see is this family has brothers that practice street justice.  They take revenge, they don't mind killing people, they're hardened.  And that's what Joseph grew up in, that kind of environment.  And you can imagine how that family might have lived in fear for a while wondering if there  were going to be repercussions from other villages for what these two brothers had done, fear  that would have surrounded the whole family.  Tragedy number three, it says Jacob traveled on to make dole eater.  While he was living there, Rubin, his son, has intercourse with Villa, his father's concubine,  one of the four wives.  And Jacob hears about it.  So he hears that his son is sleeping with his wife.  Now it's not his blood mother, but he's sleeping with her.  And Jacob, we don't see do anything, doesn't respond, he doesn't confront Rubin.  And so what we find in the previous one is rape happens and this one sleeping with his father's  wife.  So there's a sexualized society, a sexualized family, nothing is happening.  Sexual abuse is taking place, nothing is happening.  So what you can see is Joseph is growing up in a family that is really messed up, a family  that's got a lot of unhealthy things happening and a dad who's not doing anything about it.
