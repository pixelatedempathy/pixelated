Five characteristics of complex trauma so how does complex trauma affect a person and what we see is it affects every aspect of a person their brain their immune system their body their central nervous system and now we are looking at how it affects their emotions and there's a number of ways that complex trauma does damage to the emotional world and so today i want to finish off some of the characteristics of complex trauma in relation to the emotional world and the first one i want to look at is that complex trauma creates anger issues so most people with complex trauma realize that they have had anger issues for as long as they can remember there's been a part of them that might have been pushed into the subconscious but when they become aware of it they realize it's always been there and it's always been angry they are not sure why they judge right away they have all these normalities which in a way keeps themothe have to this kind of approach to being Raider, bully, habit-motorist AND sad.  They are aware of the safety and safety here so let's just stop there.  Please practice what you are doing.  Just know that there's deep buried anger.  And what some begin to realize is that they are actually afraid of their anger.  It's like if I was to start to let my anger out, it would be like, I do not know how to put a lid back on that box.  It would just, I am afraid something terrible would happen.  So I got to keep my anger repressed because I am afraid to let it out even a little bit because I do not know how I could stop it.  And that causes a lot of people to have a lot of guilt about their anger because if they have let it out a little bit, they have usually damaged somebody else.  And that's created a lot of guilt.  So for them, their anger has only been used in negative, hurtful ways.  And so now they have got guilt on top of their anger.  Most realize that their anger kind of has a nanosecond.  And that's a trip switch.  That something can happen and in a nanosecond, zero to 100, they lose it.  They go from calm to extremely angry and it's not a pretty sight.  And what is concerning to them is that they do not just have one thing that triggers their anger.  They have hundreds of different things that trigger their anger.  And so it's like they are walking through a minefield where their anger could get set off in a hundred different ways on any given day.  Some even have experienced where their anger, they quickly go to a black rage.  And what I mean by that is they are not, it's almost like they lose consciousness of what is happening.  They just get so consumed by their anger that later they do not even remember what they did.  It's like they have a blackout regarding what happens in those moments.  And that's a scary thing for them because they do not know what they did or who they hurt.  It's important to understand up front that anger is probably one of the most intense emotions.  And it creates this powerful pull to act in certain ways.  What is important to understand, again, up front is that anger was initially designed to pull us in a positive direction.  And I will explain that in a little bit.  What happens in complex trauma, what I will explain in another video is that gets messed up, and now anger pulls us in a negative direction, in a harmful direction, and to stop that pull is so hard because anger, part of what makes it intense is cortisol is released to help you fight.  And so now it's a turbo charged emotion that's got extra chemicals behind it.  Ii means a physical force that's relieving that thought and a mechanical force try to control that is even more difficult.  Some find that anger becomes their default setting.  They become addicted to anger.  They need to have anger, feel anger every day to feel normal, to feel alive, to feel energy.  And that's a dangerous place for them.  So they do not need something to trigger them to become angry.  They can get themselves angry every morning.  They purposely try to get themselves angry because that gives them the energy to get going in the day.  Another aspect of this is that many develop strong anger towards themselves because of their shame.  So they were told it was wrong to express anger externally.  They were told they were the problem.  So all of that anger got turned inward and they have huge anger at themselves.  For those who struggle with it, addiction, anger can be a huge relapse issue because as soon as they get angry, okay, I am going to go use drugs or alcohol.  That's their solution to when they are feeling anger.  It becomes their excuse to go get drunk or high.  So it's a huge relapse issue for those struggling with addiction.  I think it's important to understand that anger has, there's two types.  So I call it the lava in the volcano and the eruption.  And I call it the lava in the volcano.  And I call it the lava in the volcano.  So most people with complex trauma have this simmering lava that has been there for as long as they can remember.  It just bubbles below the surface, often subconsciously.  Once in a while, something triggers it and there's an eruption of anger.  So what is important to understand is when a lot of people think of anger, they go, I am not an angry person.  And what they are really saying to me is, I do not have the eruption.  So in their mind, anger is only an eruption, an explosion.  What I want them to see is, but you have got the lava.  And that lava can be turned inward.  That lava can just simmer away and become passive aggressive and how it affects stuff.  And it does not look like you are angry, but you have got a ton of anger down there.  That is what becomes important for many people in complex trauma.  And I think that's a really important thing to understand.  And I think that's a really important thing to understand.  So what I want my clients, clients I know, to understand is that edible٨ or topics, some of you in our training opportunity, internal complètement of that lady.

But what topics they prefront to doing that basic emotion, and then at the end, maybe to try and split.  The social specificity of that folks you are seeing and be very texting or thinking, it's easy or even weird but things that can be seen by these personalities.  When someone's talking to you, hand pomocs are hot.  We cannot dwell too much on that person's emotional state.  Because they will get to you.  So you could have the opportunity to talk.  We could have the possibility to chat or talk to someone else.  Stevieведger.  Com We can fogathe 협 pouvait je fille auxment wages with me.  Disrespected you, you should get angry because they are hurting you.  And if they continue doing that, it's going to continue to hurt you, but it's going to hurt the relationship.  And so anger kicks in to say, hey, that's a violation of love.  That's going to do short-term and long-term damage.  And so anger motivates you to try to push the relationship back to healthy.  So what happens when a relationship, when something violates love, is it steps outside of that boundary of healthy.  And anger is saying, no, we got to get back inside healthy boundaries.  We got to be respectful.  We got to be honest.  We got to be faithful to each other.  We got to respect each other.  So anger provides the motivation and the energy to try to get something back to a healthy state.  And the brain releases cortisol to help do that.  Secondly, if a person is in danger and they do not have the tools to resolve it, then anger, the cortisol gives them extra energy to fight or flight, to get out of danger.  So anger has two very, very good purposes in protecting a child and keeping stuff loving.

But what happens in complex trauma?  There's all kinds of things that can happen.  And the brain releases cortisol to help do that.  There's all kinds of things that violate love.  There's disrespect all the time.  Needs are not being met.  People are hurting each other.  People are lying to each other.  It's just constant violation of love.  The child is getting angry.  And they should be.  That's good anger.

But how do the parents respond to that anger?  They punish it.  They say they should not have that.  And so now what happens to this anger is, instead of having to do it, they are going to have to do it.  And so anger is a very good way to resolve it.

But resolving a situation or leading to a situation being resolved, more pain is added on top of it.  So anger does not resolve situations in their mind.  Anger leads to more pain.  Now you are going to get punished.  Now you are going to get judged.  Now you are going to get shamed.  Anger is bad.  Let's repress anger.  So they push it down.  Now what is important to understand is that that anger might not be expressed and they might not even be aware of how much is being expressed.  And so they push it down.  And they push it down.  And they push it down.  And they push it down.  And they push it down.  And they push it down.  And they push it down.

But it begins to show itself.  So as soon as children find something weaker, often they need to vent the anger.  So they become a bully.  They get engaged in vandalism.  They are unkind to animals.  All kinds of different things where the anger is trying to come out.  So all of this anger pushed down creates lava.

But it creates this thinking that anger is bad.  Anger, if expressed, only leads to more pain.  Somebody always will get hurt when there's anger.  So it soon becomes nothing about love.  It all becomes about this is a terrible thing that leads to more pain and hurt.  What then happens as the child gets older, they got all this anger inside, is they learn that when it comes out at certain times and in certain situations, it actually benefits them.  So they start to get angry.  They start to get angry.  They start to get angry.  They start to use anger not to bring about love and restore love.  They start to use anger in unhealthy ways that give them instant gratification.  So they find out, wow, when I get angry, I intimidate people and then I can manipulate them.  I can control them.  They get afraid of me and they do what I want.  So anger is a great tool in my manipulation toolbox.  Also, when I am angry, I do not want to be angry.  I do not want to be angry.  I do not want to be angry.  I do not feel other emotions.  I do not feel pain.  I do not feel hurt.  So if I stay angry, and that's the only emotion I feel because it's so intense that I do not feel all the other emotions, I kind of like that.  And then what happens with people is as soon as I feel embarrassment, let's switch it to anger quickly.  So anger becomes a secondary emotion.  So as soon as I feel anxiety, embarrassment, shame, fear, let's turn it to anger.  And they can do that within a nanosecond.  So they do not even know anymore what the real emotion is.  All they know is I am feeling anger.  Another tool that many children used anger for was to create boundaries.  So they tried to say no to people.  People did not respect their boundary.  And so they had only two options left.  They could isolate from people and create a boundary.  Geographically, they could isolate from people and create a boundary.  Or they could blow up and use anger to drive people away.  The problem with that is when they blow up and drive people away, usually they feel guilty afterwards.  And then they let everybody back in until they feel overwhelmed again.  And then they drive them away.  So anger became part of setting boundaries.  Then another thing is they are getting hurt all the time.  What they found is when they use their anger in sneaky ways, they are getting hurt all the time.  And so they learned to use anger in sneaky ways, they can hurt others.  So anger is a great tool to hurt people.  So anger now is not about protecting love.  Anger is now a tool to hurt people.  Then others find, I like anger because that cortisol's release, which releases adrenaline, it gives me energy.  And so if I am feeling tired, if I am feeling run down, anger gives me the energy to be productive, to get through the day.  Others, anger can be a great tool for protecting people.  And so anger becomes a bit of a shield, a radar system, a protective guard.  So the fear is when you live in danger, if I drop my guard, something bad will happen that I did not see coming.  What children learn is if I stay angry, I stay on guard.  I do not drop my guard when I am angry.  So let's stay angry because then I will never drop my guard.  I will never get hurt.  Then what people find is when they are angry, their natural response is two things.  They become self-righteous.  They always feel right and that feels good.  Secondly, they always blame somebody else for their anger.  It's their fault that I am angry.  And so it gets the attention off of me.  It gets the focus on others.  It keeps me from having to look at myself honestly, I have always got somebody else to blame.  So anger is an important tool in denying the real issues and feeling good about myself instead of guilt and shame.  So I hope what you begin to realize is children coming out of complex trauma, they started with the right use of anger.  That got shut down.  Then they developed all of these unhealthy uses of anger.  So recovery is going to require a lot of self-reliance.  And so I hope that you are going to realize that.  Re-learning anger.  Re-learning that there's healthy anger.  Re-learning not to feel guilty about that.  To learn to express that in healthy ways.  To learn to manage that.  To give up all of the unhealthy ways of anger.  There are a lot of tools there.  That's a big challenge, but it is an important part of growth and recovery.  Because this anger thing, usually we end up damaging those we love the most.  And so I hope that you are going to realize that.  And so I hope that you are going to learn to stop doing that.  And I hope that you are going to learn to be a heartbreaker.  And you are going to learn that you are going to be a heartbreaker.  You are going to learn to be a heartbreaker.  And so that's why we want to grow in this area, is to stop doing damage in intimate relationships.  The next characteristic of complex trauma in relationship to emotions is false guilt.  So true guilt is when I do something that violates love.  So I should feel guilty because that motivates me to stop lying, to stop stealing, to stop cheating, to stop being disrespectful, to others.  So true guilt is a powerful, good, negative emotion that's designed like anger to push me back to living within the boundaries of love.  False guilt comes out of complex trauma.  It's when a child is made to feel guilty even though they did not do anything wrong.  It's when they are made to feel responsible for something that was not their responsibility at all.  This is so common in complex trauma, but most people do not even see it.  They think their false guilt is actually true guilt.  And so distinguishing between true guilt and false guilt is a key element in recovery.  So let me give you some of the ways parents create false guilt.  So number one, they blame you for stuff as if it was your fault.  So dad is angry.  Somehow dad makes it your fault.  Mom is unhappy.  Somehow mom makes it your fault.  No, it's their choice to be angry, to be unhappy.  It's not your fault.  That's on them.

But to a child, it's your fault that I am so angry.  And you believe it.  And now you feel guilty when you have not done anything wrong.  Or dad and mom are getting a divorce.  And somehow they make it sound like because you are a bad kid, that's causing us to not get along.  So we are splitting.  It's your fault.  Many children have carried that false guilt.  Or anytime somebody is unhappy, somebody's in a painful emotion, somebody fails, somehow the child is made to feel it's their fault.  They should have done something more.  They should have helped more.  They should have fixed the problem for the person.  The fact that the person's unhappy must be my fault.  The fact that the person failed and is struggling must be my fault.  Or some children have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  They should have done something wrong.  Kids grew up with parents who were poor.  And what the parents often said to the kids is, well, it's because you kids were poor.  Because you cost so much.  So now the kids are feeling guilty all the time that they live in a poor family.  Or the child has, their needs are not being met.  They are not connecting.  They are not being nurtured.  They are not being validated.  And they go and they try to get those needs met.  And their parents say, you are being selfish.  So now they feel guilty for having a need.  That's false guilt.  Or they are tired.  They know they need to rest.  They know they need to do some self-care.  They know they need to relax.

But as soon as they rest and relax, their parents say, you are lazy.  You are selfish.  Get to work.  So now they feel guilty for actually taking care of themselves in a healthy way.  So all of those things, the parents have been mistraining the child's conscience.  So they feel guilt when they are actually doing healthy stuff.  And that is very common.  So let me expand on that with the next one.  So an unmet need in the other person.  In complex trauma families, often the child is made to feel responsible for what is happening in another person.  So let me give you an example.  Let's say that dad is beating up mom.  The child is made to feel, because of all the trauma, that the child is being beaten up by mom.  And the child is being beaten up by mom.  And the child is being beaten up by mom.  And the child is being beaten up by mom.  And the child is being beaten up buddy was a child that has been continually beaten and beaten up, hit or gained.  That child is being beaten up and beaten up often enough to know what they are going to do about that child.  After about 3 to 4 step in protect everybody else if they see dad being upset if they see mom being sad i should make them feel better it's my fault that they are sad or upset if their sibling commits suicide if their sibling gets involved in drugs it's my fault i should have been able to stop it i should have been a better brother or sister to them it's my fault if they say no to somebody who asks for something that is unreasonable and they set a boundary i feel guilty i should not have done that that's being unkind so all of those things are come out of a conditioning that i am responsible for everybody's safety everybody's needs and if they are not safe if they are making bad decisions their needs are not being met somehow it's my fault so what that is doing is setting unrealistic expectations for yourself that's what ultimately creates false guilt is initially it's mom and dad set expectations for you that are unrealistic then you internalize that and now you set them for yourself and you create your own false guilt so you feel guilty for having needs you feel guilty for not being perfect you feel guilty for not learning quickly enough the first time you feel guilty for crying when you are hurt you feel guilty for not reading people's minds and knowing what they wanted or what they need you feel guilty for not knowing how to do something automatically some people even feel guilty for being alive for being born because they were told their parents life would have been so much easier if they were not around some feel guilty for being a girl rather than a boy some feel guilty for being neglected and abused and abandoned and not loved because somehow it's my fault i am bad so all of this unrealistic expectations you can spot it because you develop a thinking pattern that's i should have been i should be this unrealistic expectations feeds false guilt and so what happens for many people is this false guilt becomes their default setting it's their normal they live with it every day they just feel guilty all the time and so then something in their brain goes okay i need to feel guilty all the time to feel normal so if they have a day where they are not feeling guilty their brain is going i do not like this now i feel guilty for not being guilty i need to somehow return to feeling guilty and so they get stuck in needing to feel guilty that is so common and so they often will not just feel guilty for not feeling guilty they will sometimes do stuff they will hyperanalyze themselves analyze every action every motive and find something wrong to create guilt or they will do stuff that creates guilt all of those things need to feed the default setting and that often leads to what we talked about earlier is guilt has a second default setting is i need to keep beating myself up i got to be hard on myself self-critical i got to feed the internal critic there's one other cause of guilt and that is organizations churches that set rules as to what healthy spiritual behavior is but they are not actually based on love they are based on somebody's preferences so you were told you are sinning you are being bad you are dishonoring god you are doing something wrong by dancing by wearing makeup by watching a movie by listening to certain kinds of music all of those things somebody created rules and then they said you are bad and it created false guilt so what comes out of religious abuse spiritual abuse is usually tons of false guilt because of all the false standards that were set for you that you were told were from god that were the mark of health or spirituality and you fell short all the time and many of them were not based on love and it creates false guilt okay let's go on to the next one people from complex trauma do not deal well with stress and this is so important because complex trauma being in danger is all about stress your stress system is constantly activated so let me back up and say this stress is a natural system in our body makes you feel like that all the time that time is when one one the body that is engaged or activated every time we face a problem we are in it we face a task we face an event that we got to perform we got to solve a problem so it says there's a problem here that has to be dealt with there's a situation that needs extra energy so the stress system is activated and so it requires emotional energy intellectual energy and physical energy all three aspects require energy what's important to understand is there's two types of distress you stress and distress so you stress is good stress distress is negative stress so you stress is the stress i need to get out of bed in the morning to perform on my job to be involved with my kids it's the pressure put on me to do what is right to do what is healthy i need that kind of pressure pressure to keep going.  It breaks me out of inertia that I naturally go to.  Distress, on the other hand, is too much stress that I cannot resolve that begins to pull me in a negative direction.  So let me take you to the child of complex trauma.  Their needs are not being met.  They are being hurt.  They are in danger.  So they have got an environment that's constantly creating stress for them.  They cannot resolve it.  Nobody's giving them the tools.  Nobody's giving them the support to resolve it.  So they cannot develop healthy ways to handle the stress.  So let me back up and say this.  A child coming into the world has no natural tools to handle stress.  They must be taught how to handle stress.  So they come to feeding themselves.  That stresses them out.  Mom and dad teach them how to feed themselves.  Tying their shoes, riding their bikes, handling, making their bed.  Every little problem causes them stress.  Mom and dad come beside them, encourage them, validate them, teach them tools, and support them as they learn the skills.  And so what you can see is from zero to 20, a child is learning thousands and thousands of little tools that each one is handling a problem.  Each one is creating a problem.  Each one is expanding their window of tolerance for problem situations.  What happens in complex trauma is nobody's coming along to teach them tools.  Nobody's coming along to support them.  So they are not growing incrementally in their toolbox for handling the problems of life.  What becomes their only way of dealing with the stress?  Fight or flight or freeze.  Get out of here.  This is going to hurt us.  And so at a very early age, as soon as there's stress, even low level stress, that's jumping off point to fight or flight.  So let me go back.  What is it that actually is happening when parents come beside a child and who faces a problem?  So they get dysregulated by the stress.  This is too much for me.  I cannot handle it.  They cry.  The parents come and they connect.  They act as co-regulators.  The parents teach them the tools to meet that problem.  The parent meets their needs.  All of those are part of the learning to deal with stress.  And so complex trauma, the child does not get that.  And so they have a low stress tolerance and they are not even aware of it.  They just go to fight or flight.  So many people coming into adult life do not even realize that their stress is building.  They are not even aware of it.  They are not even aware of it.  They are not they do not realize they are under stress or they are feeling stressed out until the needle is in the red.  So on a scale of one to 10, they do not even detect their stress until it's nine or 10 because all of their life has been stressful.  That's been their default setting.  They are normal.  They do not even realize when they are at three, four and five, because that's all just in their subconscious.  They just live with that all the time.  And so the problem is, is that when they are getting to five, six, seven, it's not yet on the radar.  It's not yet in the red.  They are not even consciously aware that they are stressed, but they are already going to fight or flight.  They are already going to the old toolbox to handle the stress.  And so part of recovery is learning to detect my stress levels when they are at a lower level, not wait until they are nine and 10, but to detect them earlier.  So just be aware of things.  Create extra stress on your nervous system.  That's a good place to start.  So anytime you feel that you do not have power in a situation, you feel out of control, you feel dominated, you feel overwhelmed.  Anytime you feel vulnerable, you feel anxiety, you feel depression.  Those are all adding stress to you.  Anytime you feel threatened or attacked, anytime there's conflict in relationships, anytime you feel like you are in a situation where you are in a situation where you are in a situation where you are in a situation where you are feeling alone, anytime you go through separation or loss or you are feeling lonely, that's adding stress to your system.  Anytime you go through change or transitions, anytime there's a disruption in your daily routine, that adds stress to your system.  When you get memories of past events that were painful, that adds stress to your system.  So be aware of that.  Then be aware of the early warning signs that stress is affecting you.  So physical warning signs.  You might start having trouble sleeping or you might just want to sleep all the time.  Or you might feel your blood pressure is going up.  You are getting tight muscles.  You are getting headaches.  You are tightening your jaw.  You are getting pain in your eyes.  Be aware of the physical symptoms that stress is building.  Then be aware of thoughts that start to change.  So you cannot turn your brain off.  You are worrying all the time.  You are obsessing.  You are starting to go back to your internal critic and beat yourself up, put yourself down.  You are jumping to the worst case scenario.  You are becoming more negative and critical of everything.  Or you get brain fog.  You cannot think straight or you just have brain chatter happening all the time.  Then be aware of other emotions that start to happen that are negative.  When you get more stressed, you usually get more angry and irritable.  Everything starts to annoy you.  Anger is very close to the surface.  You are not as patient with people.  You are not as tolerant.  You feel overwhelmed very quickly and that leads you to just feeling hopeless.  So as soon as you get a bit of stress, oh give up.  This is too much.  You cannot tolerate it at all.  You just go to feeling overwhelmed and hopeless and depressed.  Some just quickly go to panic.  Some go to almost a catatonic state.  They cannot think, they are frozen.  Some go to self-pity.  Poor me.  Life sucks.  Everybody's against me and they go there emotionally then look at changes in your actions so now instead of wanting to connect with people you want to isolate now you just want to do distractions all the time be busy busy busy doing stuff you are antsy you cannot sit still you have difficulty being present to other people in conversations to your children you feel powerless to do anything or you just spend all your day organizing organizing organizing it does not matter but you do it or you talk constantly or you do not talk at all or you eat a lot or you do not eat at all so those changes are early warning signs that stress is building now what is important for people from complex trauma to realize is that when stress has been your default setting when you have not got tools for you dealing with situations properly often you become your own worst enemy so stress was initially created by the external world now you create stress for yourself so you set unrealistic expectations for yourself that you can never meet that creates stress you expect everything to be done perfectly the first time you expect everything to be hassle free you create stress for yourself You try to control others.  That creates stress for yourself.  You do not plan.  You just spontaneously bounce around.  That creates stress for yourself.  You procrastinate.  You stick your head in the sand.  You avoid problems.  That creates stress for yourself.  So what you are trying to do, your brain has been trained to just live for instant gratification.  So you avoid stress by doing something that immediately makes it feel less stressful in the moment, but it creates greater stress down the road.  You are afraid to say no.  That creates more stress down the road.  You let yourself get involved in unhealthy relationships and do not set boundaries with unhealthy people.  That creates more stress.  You become preoccupied with what others think.  You live with a guilty conscience that you have not sorted out.  You have a fear of change, a fear of failure, constant anxiety.  That adds stress.  You have all these resentments and unresolved conflicts that just eat away inside of you.  That creates stress.  You get into this negative thinking and awfulizing, catastrophizing everything.  That creates stress.  You go to the victim mentality, the self-pity.  That creates stress.  You do not believe you can be a burden to anybody else because that would make you a pain, so you just try to take everything on yourself and never ask for help.  That creates stress.  You become addicted to chaos.  That creates stress.  So be aware of the internal maladaptive behaviors that actually add to your stress life.  The next one that is so important to understand, I think you have seen it, is what happens with complex trauma is the child becomes stunted in their emotional growth.  So instead of gaining more and more tools to handle painful emotions, you become addicted to chaos.  That creates stress.  To handle emotions, to handle problems, to handle stressful situations, you just go to fight or flight.  So you have a low emotional intelligence.  You become stunted in your emotional growth.  That's why for many people coming out of complex trauma, they might be 50 years old physically, but they feel eight years old emotionally because that's the tools they have in their emotional world is that of an eight-year-old.  So a big part of that is that they have a lot of tools.  So a big part of recovery is emotional growth.  It is getting back to that stunted emotional state and learning tools to handle life, to handle stress, to handle situation so that you are growing emotionally.  Now that takes a lot of work, but it is vital because if you remain stunted emotionally, you will basically, be incapable of healthy adult relationships and you will do a lot of damage to your partner and to your children.  The final emotional issue I want to talk about today that comes out of complex trauma is fear of abandonment.  And next time I am going to look at all of the other fears that come out of complex trauma.  And the key thing to understand is that complex trauma creates fear as the main emotion, as the default emotion.  And it shows up in hundreds of different ways.

But fear of abandonment is one of the most powerful fears.  It is intense.

But for most people, they are not even aware it's there.  It is subconscious.  It is below the surface.  It only shows up when they are in an intimate relationship.  So let me go back.  Complex trauma basically is a child feeling abandoned.  So they are neglected.  They are abused.  They feel all alone in the world.  They feel abandonment.  And I think abandonment is probably the most intensely painful emotion.  Because basically what it says is, I am a zero.  I must be worth nothing that nobody is here for me.  That nobody wants to connect with me.  And so what that does is produces huge shame.  I am a zero.

But also, produces a deep fear of abandonment.  So you have got two dynamics going on here that are so important to understand.  What does deep shame say?  Everybody who gets to know me will abandon me.  What does fear of abandonment say?  I cannot have anybody abandon me.  I cannot go through that pain again.  I have to prevent being abandoned.  So you are split.  I am going to be abandoned, but I cannot be abandoned.  And that is what is working out in the.  Lives of people with complex trauma.  So this fear of being abandoned again with this belief that I will be abandoned again creates huge problems for people as they come into adult life.  So the first problem is a person who's abandoned, basically, everybody's going to abandon me because the two people that brought me into the world abandoned me.  So that means everybody who gets to know me will abandon me.  So now they twist everything that happens.  They will distort the emotions in life to fit that script.  So they will distort what a person says, how they talk to them, what they did not talk to them, their tone of voice, the wording, all of that will be twisted to be they do not like me, they are about to abandon me.  So they get all of these justifications for it in their own mind that they quickly go to.  They do not even acknowledge that I have a fear of abandonment.  They just go, that person does not really love me.  They are just using me.  That's easy to go there.  That sounds good.  That's what I am going to say.  Or, oh, that person's being nice to me.  They are probably talking behind my back.  They are going to abandon me.  They do not seem too excited to be around me today.  Yesterday they were.  Their eyes lit up when I came around.  Today their eyes did not light up.  Oh, they are getting tired of me.  They are going to abandon me.  They are always saying nice, validating things to me.  I bet you they have got like 100 filters in their brain that they filter out all the things they wish they could say to me, and they only say positive, encouraging things.  Oh, they are talking to somebody over there.  They are laughing.  They are having such a good time.  They did not do that when they talked to me.  So that must mean they want to be with them more than me.  They are going to abandon me.  So all of these systems get set up in the brain that drive you to the same conclusion over and over again.  They are going to abandon me.

But then it goes deeper than that.  People with fear of abandonment who conclude that everybody's going to abandon them actually can drive people away.  They create abandonment scenarios.  They push people to abandon them.  So they get super needy, super clingy, super demanding.  They smother people not wanting to be abandoned.  They try to control people so they want abandonment.  Well, what happens?  They create what they fear.  People get sick of it and they just set a boundary and they pull away from them.  They create abandonment.  Or they have healthy people in their life and they do not feel normal with healthy people.  So they just ghost them.  They cut them out of their life because they get too afraid.  They do not know how to relate to healthy people.  Or some go to playing games and testing people once they get in a relationship.  So they kind of give them a cold shoulder.  And basically what they are saying is, I wonder if they are going to come back.  I am going to push them away.  Let's say if they stay away.  Because if they stay away, yes, they were going to abandon me anyways.  Or they go, you do not really love me.  I do not think you really love me.  And they just are pushing.  You got to tell me constantly that you love me or else you are going to abandon me.  Or they keep putting themselves down.  I am such a terrible catch.  I do not know why you want to be with me.  Look at all my flaws.  Anybody else would leave me.  And they do that game with the person.  Or they go, you know what?  I am surprised you are not with that person.  They are just so much better than I am.  And it's almost like they are just testing to see if that person, their partner will start looking at that person and paying attention.  Because that will then fit their script that everybody's going to abandon me.

But then there's another piece to this that happens with those who have been abandoned.  They have not connected with anybody as a child.  Anytime they tried to connect, they got hurt.  So they concluded connection was a bad thing.

But more than that, they never got any healthy tools to connect.  And so now when they come into a relationship, they are afraid to connect.  If I connect, I am going to get hurt.  So I will try to have pseudo intimacy in a relationship.

But the other person goes, no, we need to connect to have a healthy relationship.  And the other person keeps trying to connect.

But the person who's been abandoned just remains emotionally available.  They just remain pseudo intimacy only.  And the other person gets tired of trying to connect and not being able to connect.  And abandonment gets created.

Another thing that happens for people who have been abandoned is they develop unhealthy expectations about what not being abandoned looks like.  So they actually, they come into relationships with all these expectations that you have to do this if you are not going to abandon me.  And they set up abandonment again.  So one of the things is, and this can be very subtle, a very subconscious thing.  They might not even say it, but it's there.  You must only love me.  If you have any other friends, if you are close to your family, that means you do not love me.  That means you are going to abandon me.  You must never have a flaw.  You must never fail me once.  If I can find a flaw in you, if you fail me once, then you are going to abandon me.  So I am going to be looking for flaws.  I am going to be giving you careful scrutiny.  And what happens is for people who have been abandoned, they will create flaws.  Just say, okay, not a safe person.  No, they are going to abandon me.  You must give me constant validation.  If you do not constantly praise me, validate me, delight in me, then that means you do not find me attractive.  That means you are going to abandon me.  You must never set boundaries with me.  If you say no to me, that means you are abandoning me.  You must give me constant attention whenever I want it.  If you do not give me constant attention, if you develop your own hobbies, if you develop time with your friends, that means you are losing interest in me.  And that means you are going to abandon me.  You must never give me constructive criticism.  You must never point out flaws in me.  You must never get annoyed with me.  That proves you find me unlovable and that you are planning to leave me.  I would say that this fear of abandonment is one of the biggest issues for people coming out of more severe complex trauma.  The problem is most are not even aware of it.  It's just a part of their subconscious.

But when it gets triggered, they go to anger, they go to lashing out, they go to behaviors to try to prevent their shame being exposed, try to prevent being abandoned, and they can do a lot of damage.  And so learning to heal this deep abandonment wound is a key element of healing in recovery.  So those are the emotions that get affected by complex trauma.  And I hope you see, wow, it does a ton of damage.

But there is hope.  You can heal that stuff.  And it takes time.

But once it begins to heal, it is such a wonderful thing to see.  Well, that's the end of another Friday night.  Thank you again for being with us.  Have a great weekend.  We will see you next time.
