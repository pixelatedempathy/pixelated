> We don't just process conversations. We understand them. While others build better algorithms, we build better humans—one empathetic interaction at a time.

## 🎭 Project Identity & Mission

**Pixelated Empathy** is an enterprise-grade platform engineered to translate human emotion into actionable intelligence. Our cornerstone, **The Empathy Gym™**, provides mental health professionals with a high-fidelity, risk-free AI environment to master complex therapeutic dialogues.

### Container Orchestration
- **Docker Compose**: Primary deployment method (Development, Staging, Production).
- **Kubernetes**: Future/Secondary infrastructure (Helm charts available in `/helm`).

### Core Goals:
- **Forge Empathy**: Transform difficult conversations into safe practice.
- **Architect Understanding**: Map the "Emotional Cartography" of human interaction.
- **Ethical AI Integration**: Prioritize psychological safety and privacy above all.
- **Validation-First**: Move beyond problem-solving to genuine emotional validation.

## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence Engine

We utilize a sophisticated hybrid model to understand the human psyche:
- **Emotional Taxonomy**: Plutchik's Wheel (Basic & Advanced) + Big Five (OCEAN) traits.
- **Representation**: Normalized scores (0.0 to 1.0) for all intensities.
- **Conversational Dynamics**: Analyzing tone, flow, reciprocity, and the "power of silence."
- **Dual-Persona**: Adaptive intelligence that recognizes shifting roles (Mentor, Peer, Help-seeker).

## 🤖 Agent Ecosystem (MCP)

This repository is built for **Agentic Development** through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).
- **Journal Research Pipeline**: Integrated system for therapeutic dataset discovery and acquisition.

## 🔒 Security & Ethical Rails

1. **Zero-Leak Policy**: Redact all PII/Secrets. Use `pnpm security:check` frequently.
2. **Psychological Safety**: Handle crisis signals defensively. No toxic positivity.
3. **Data Integrity**: Validate all emotional constructs and scores within strict ranges.
4. **Confidentiality**: Respect HIPAA-level standards for sensitive mental health data.
