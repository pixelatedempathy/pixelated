I do not know if I am good at administration.  Total blank.  You know all the roles you played.  You know all the masks that you wore.

But you are not sure who you really are.  Do things that help you find that out.  Take personality type tests.  Read books on that.  Begin to explore what interests mean.  Maybe I will take guitar lessons.  Maybe I will try an art class.  Maybe I will try martial arts.  Whatever.  Try different things to find out what you are good at.  Now here's what you have to understand.  What does shame do when you go to try a new thing?  Oh, what happens if I am not good at it and I look stupid?  I better not risk trying anything.  So in order to get to know yourself, you have got to push through shame and risk failing and looking stupid and moving out of your comfort zone.

But as you do that, you realize nobody killed me and I did not die.  And I actually grew from that.  And you get more courage.  And you get more courage to keep doing it.  Next one.  Grieve your past.  So I talked about accepting your past.

But that does not mean you are happy about your past.  It means there's a lot of crap that you have to grieve.  So a couple things that I want you to think about.  One of the things that you are grieving with shame is you did not get a healthy childhood that you should have got.  So you are grieving something you never had but you should have had.  So you have lost something that you have never had but you have lost something you should have had.  And so part of what happens as people get to know about complex trauma and their shame is they begin to realize how much their childhood affected them and they start to go, I wish I had a different childhood.  I wish I did not go through that.  And then they start grieving what they did not have.  Secondly, you grieve the many losses that you did have.  The loss of connection.  The loss of certain friendships.  The loss of certain things because of choices by family or yourself.  So there's a grieving part that is part of the healing process.  Next one.  You have to have a clean conscience.  So what we talked about in the first talk was this.  Guilt is about what I do.  Shame is about who I am.  The problem with complex trauma is when you do something bad, they say you are bad.  So they blend guilt and shame.  And so what happens now when you fail, you do something morally wrong, you tell a lie, you cheat, whatever, it feeds your shame.  And you walk around saying, not only did I fail, I am a failure.  And it feeds your shame.  So if you do something morally wrong and your conscience bothers you, clean it up right away.  Because if you do not, it's going to keep bugging you and it gradually is going to pull you into deeper shame.  So that becomes an important piece.  Next one.  Service.  And what I want to say about this is for many people, service is important in finding out what I am good at.  What I can offer people and it helps me heal to realize I have something to offer.

But for some people it's very dangerous.  Because if you got your validation as a child from helping everybody and you were the perfect little servant around the house, and that's where your validation came from, to step back into a service world, could really mess you up.  Because it could pull you back into looking for validation which comes like a drug.  So if that was part of your validation growing up, be very careful as you get into service.  Do not go there unless people in your life think you are ready for it.  Because it's very easy to get there and then once you are there, you start to get into service.  You stop working on yourself, you get wrapped up in all that you are doing, and then if you are struggling, you are afraid to say anything because now everybody's looking up to you and it becomes a disaster.  Next one, many people find there's a value in healing shame in the spiritual thing, in a higher power, in a new belief system that is a better definition of happiness, of value, of what makes life work.  All of that can be important.  If you do have God or a higher power, that becomes for you a mirror that you believe is the most accurate mirror in the world.  And that tells you the truth about yourself better than anybody else.  So that one is important.  Next one, humility versus humiliation.  Now here's what I want you to understand.  A lot of people, cultures, religious people, have defined humility as shame.  Now I want you to understand that.  If you go to many places and ask them to define humility, guess what they will say?  You are worse than everybody.  You never walk around and say, I accomplished something.  You see yourself as less than.  And so if you ever feel good about yourself, shame on you, you are proud.  You should be walking around saying, I am a nobody, I am no good.  And that's how they define humility.  You realize that is the wrong definition.  And if you are going to heal from shame, you need the right definition of humility.  And the right definition of humility is this.  You see yourself accurately.  And what does it mean to see yourself accurately?  I am not better than or worse than anybody.  Humans, we are a level playing field.  We all have equal value.  Secondly, humility says, I want to learn.

I want to keep growing.  I do not want to get locked into this place where I cannot risk trying anything for fear of failure, or I can never be wrong because I might be humiliated.  So the fear of people from complex trauma is if I humble myself, I will get humiliated.  And humiliated was terrible.  Humility is totally different.  It is seeing myself accurately.  It is being open to change, to growth, to learning.  And that is absolutely essential if you are going to heal shame.  Now the next one is inner child.  Now we spend a lot of time at React.

Let me just say a few things.  Inner child for a lot of people, they go, oh, that's hokey.  That's just weird.  What are you going to ask me to do?  So here's how I talk about it.  I think everybody that I deal with from complex trauma, if I say, do you still sense there's a little child in you somewhere?  They all agree.  And then I go, okay, let's just focus on that little child inside of you, which is a younger you.  What emotions is in you that that child is feeling?  And they will go, wow, they are hurt.  They are sad.  They are angry.  They are full of fear.  They got tons of shame.  And they hate themselves.  I say, okay, so that child, that inner you, that little you, has nothing but negative emotions.  How does that child look physically?  They got their head down.  They are curled up in a fetal position.  They cannot look at people in the eye.  They can define and describe that child.  Okay, how does that child feel about you, the adult?  Ooh, he does not trust me.  Why?  Because I abandoned that child.  I hated that part of me.  I did not want anything to do with that part of me.  I was impatient with that part of me.  I was embarrassed by that part of me.  Okay, so that child feels abandoned by you and does not trust you.

But that child is you.  It's a part of you.  So healing from shame is taking that part of you that you have rejected and been embarrassed by and accepting it and nurturing it so that it feels loved and it can heal and become part of the adult you.  So that's what this is about.  So then I say, okay, let's just say one of your biological children spilled their milk or fell off their bike and tore a hole in their brand new pair of pants.  What would you do to that child as they are crying and angry at themselves?  You would hug them.  You would say, it's okay.  It's just things, et cetera.  You would nurture them and comfort them.  I go, what happens if your little child fell off their bike and messed stuff up?  I would say, I would be in that child's face, criticizing them, calling them down.  So here's what I want you to understand.  You parent your biological child differently than you parent yourself.  You are loving and nurturing and comforting and understanding to your biological children because you know what shame-based parenting did to you.

But yet, when you parent yourself, you still use shame-based parenting.  People do not grow from shame or heal from shame until they parent themselves in a loving, nurturing way.  And that starts with that little part of you that you have always been embarrassed by.  So let me just read this.  It came out recently.  I found it.  It says, Toxic shame has its root in childhood, abandonment, abuse, and trauma.  And you are familiar with all that.  As such, feeling better will almost always go back to accessing your childhood self, the very part of you that was confronted with the trauma in the first place.  Learning how to interact with and care for your younger self is called inner child work.  And there are a number of reasons why this practice is powerful.  Firstly, inner child work helps you access feelings that you have repressed and disassociated from in an attempt to protect yourself as a child.  By re-experiencing these emotions, you will be able to release them from your body and mind and generate deep healing.  So you connect emotionally.  Secondly, inner child work is tremendously insightful and revealing.  Often some of the most important questions you have carried consciously or subconsciously are answered while doing inner child work.  And thirdly, inner child work is learning self-compassion in action.  When you learn how to re-parent your inner child, you develop a deep, strong connection with yourself which has a ripple effect on the rest of your life.  So what's inner child work?  Re-parenting yourself.  Learning to parent yourself with compassion.  Learning to stop beating up and rejecting and abandoning yourself.  Final point, number 19.  Be patient.  It takes time.  Part, I want to do something a little bit different.  So what we have been doing with the shame piece is we looked at the people God loved and we saw some pretty messed up people that He loved and we looked at a couple of stories.  Then we looked at what God says about us and we went through all the different Bible verses where God describes who we are.  Tonight I want to come at it from a different way that the Bible comes at it.  So it is about this.  Psalm chapter 8 says, when I look at the night sky, so just picture yourself, let's say outside of the city limits in a winter night looking up and you see the stars, you see the northern lights dancing in the north.  So when I look at the night sky and I see the works of your fingers, the moon and the stars you set in place, what you end up going is, wow, God is so big.  God is so amazing.  Why would God be concerned about little old me?  He's got stars and galaxies to take care of.  He's got all of this stuff to keep on course.  He's probably too busy for me.  And so what He says is, when I look at this greatness of God and the creation that He made, what are mere mortals that you should think about them, human beings that you should care for them?  And the point is, I am overwhelmed by the fact that such a big God cares about somebody so little.  And so what happens in the Bible on Sunday, on a number of occasions, and I put this couple in the book of Job and Isaiah 40, is it purposely tries to help us think about how big God is.  And so in Isaiah 40 it says, think of the things in creation that cause you to stand in awe.  So looking up at the stars, and it says, oh, those are just a small little thing to God.  Standing and seeing mountains for the first time, you feel so small, you are just overwhelmed with awe.  It says, oh God, God can just put all of that on a scale, it's just like dust.  And then seeing the ocean and the broadness and the expanse of it, you just feel the sense of awe.  And He says, oh, that's just a drop in a bucket, that's how big God is.  So it's in, if you look at the things in creation that cause you to stand in awe of God, and then you go, but those are just tiny to God, they are almost insignificant to God, then how big is God?  And when you say, how big is God, how amazing that He cares about me, and that He spends time with me and He sees value in me.  So what I want to do tonight is have you to think about the ocean.  I love doing this.  I have this love-fear of the ocean.  I got caught in a riptide once that scared me to death and I thought I was going to drown.  So I have learned a healthy fear of the ocean, but I love walking by the ocean.  I love being on a cruise ship on the ocean, the bigness, the peacefulness, all of those things.  So I want you to think about the amazing design that the ocean has in the big picture of our world.  And I hope what you will see is this amazing designer who is designed with great intricacy, an ocean that fulfills all kinds of different functions and that just leaves you with a sense of awe.  So just to give you one thought, you are going to have to put your thinking caps on with this.  Stop and think of every river that goes into the ocean.  So you have got the Mississippi River, you have got the Amazon River, you keep on going.  How many gallons an hour would be going into the ocean?  Do you realize that there's no rivers going out of the ocean?  So God had to design an evaporation rate that would match the water coming in.  Because if he evaporated too fast, then the ocean would get smaller and smaller.  If he did not evaporate fast enough, the ocean would begin to take over the world.  You see?  So the balance between water coming in and water being evaporated is just amazing when you start to think about who designed that.  That is quite something.  And then the ocean's going to be like, and then the ocean's got to be big enough to allow for the odd glacier to melt or the odd flood to add extra water that year, and the ocean can absorb it because it's big enough.  So that's kind of where we are going to go.  So let me just give you some very basic information about the oceans.  They cover 75% of our Earth's surface.  They are the least explored part of our world.  They figure they have probably explored less than 5% of the ocean.  That's how big it is on unexplored territory.  It holds 97% of the world's water.  So if you look at all the lakes, the Great Lakes, Lake Winnipeg, Lake Manitoba, all of those added up with all of the rivers, that's only 3% of the water in the world.  The other 97% is in the oceans.  I found the next one interesting.  Half of our world's population lives within 50 miles of the coastline.  That's how close we are to the ocean.  That's how much important it is to life.  $500 billion a year of business comes from the fish of the ocean, the other parts of the ocean, the chemicals, etc.  So it is an essential piece of our creation on all kinds of different levels.  So the amount of food it provides, understand one billion of the people of the world rely on the fish of the ocean as their major food source.  That's how dependent they are.  10% of the protein intake in our world comes from the fish of the oceans.  More fish are harvested than cattle, pigs, sheep, poultry, and eggs combined.  That's the amount.  That's the ocean.  So it is a massive food source.  Next, how important is it?  The ocean is the thing that moderates the temperature of our world.  So why do not we boil?  Why do not we freeze?  Thank the ocean for that.  It plays a key role.  It absorbs heat and cold.  It absorbs the sun's rays and the heat from them.  And if you did not know, there are rivers at the bottom of the ocean that move the water around.  So when we go to Florida, there's the Gulf Stream that goes up the east coast of the United States and Canada.  That is a deep underwater river that rushes north and carries the warm southern water up into the North Atlantic and it regulates the temperatures of the ocean.  And then of the climates of the land.  So it becomes a big part of that.  Do you realize that if we did not have oceans, we would not have mountains?  I did not really know that until a while ago.  So how did mountains happen?  You got two continental plates that collide and get pushed up.  Why do not they slide back down?  Because when they got pushed up, oceans landed on what was there and the oceans hold the mountains up.  So that is another thing that you maybe did not know.  It is the source of all fresh water.  So over a thousand cubic kilometers of water evaporate from the ocean every day.  A thousand kilometers up, down, and deep of water evaporate from the ocean every day.  That is a lot of water.  And then that gets distributed as fresh water and then it gets distributed as fresh water in rain and snow.  So the way we get fresh water is not it's magically produced.  It comes from salt water in the ocean that evaporates and then creates.  So there's that beautiful system in place.  All of our fresh water ultimately is dependent on the ocean.  Sixty chemicals come from the ocean.  Many that cannot be found anywhere else on land.  So we are dependent on a lot of that.  Fifty percent of the oxygen of the world does not come from the Amazon rainforest.  It comes from the ocean.  It is the biggest supplier of oxygen but it is also the greatest user of carbon dioxide.  And do you want to know what's greater than the Amazon forest?  It's the underwater kelp forests, seaweed forests of the oceans that take in all the carbon dioxide and release oxygen.  So the ocean plays a huge role in absorbing our carbon dioxide and providing oxygen for us.  Every time a wave crests it releases oxygen from the water into the air.  So waves become a part of that and then the algae, the plankton, all of those things in the water absorb the carbon dioxide.  So it keeps us alive.  Okay, now this is the fun part.  We have talked about all of the water going into the ocean so there has to be an evaporation.

But I want you to think of something else.  If all the water goes into the ocean and nothing goes out of the ocean, what happens when you get water that does not have an exit?  It gets stagnant.  Water that just sits without any movement gets stagnant.  What happens with stagnant water?  It loses its oxygen and it gets full of diseases.  So God's got a problem.  How in the world is he going to keep this body of water that has no exits from becoming stagnant?  Absolutely fascinating.  So what is one of the things that we use today to filter water?  Sand and charcoal.  So you want to know what God did?  He says, I am going to put sandy shores around all the oceans.  Then I am going to put this moon in the sky and guess what it's going to do?  It's going to pull the whole ocean one way and then the other way called tides twice a day.  And guess what's going to happen when the tide comes in and the tide goes out?  They are going to wash up on the sand and get filtered.  And then the tide goes the other way, they are going to get washed up on the sand and get filtered.  What a great filter system.  Who would have thought of that?

But God pulled that off.  And then he put these plants in the water and I talked about the underwater rivers.

But what happens is as these underwater rivers hit the mountains, so there's mountains bigger than our tallest land mountains, there's mountains bigger than that under the water that are totally buried by water.  So the rivers hit these and it dries everything up and stirs up.  And then every time storms come, they further the filtering process.  They stir up stuff so that it can get cleaned.  All of those things keep the oceans from becoming stagnant, keep them clean, and keep oxygen happening in them.  The next piece that has to happen if this is going to work, you got to have plants that can absorb the carbon dioxide and release oxygen.  So they have to be able to get the sun's rays.  So water has to be transparent.  It can look blue, but the sun has to be able to penetrate it to a depth so that the plants can get the benefit of the sun's rays so they can grow and do all the important things that they do.  Okay, next thing, if you are going to get plants to grow, they need fertilizer.  Do you realize that when an orca whale takes a poop, it's 150 pounds at a time of poop.  That's a lot of fertilizer bags in that one little poop.  So guess what God built into this ocean?  Fish who need to poop.  And now you are fertilizing all of the plants of the ocean in a beautiful way.  Sonny, you are just going to let that sink in a little bit.  You are going to enjoy that one.  Tell your kids.  You know how big an orca's poop is, all of that.  Okay, I digress.  Next one.  Now you have got the problem, everything sinks to the bottom, and the ocean is over five miles deep in places.  All of those nutrients are going to settle into the bottom.  Plants are up close to the top.  How do you get that up to the plants?  So again, those underwater rivers hit the bottom, and they hit the mountains, and they drive all the water to the top.  So there's this constant cycling of water that takes place thanks to these deep underwater rivers, and then the storm stirs everything up.  Okay, now you have got one other problem.  Think of science in high school.  What are the three different forms of a substance?  You have a solid, a liquid, and a gas.  Remember that?  So if you take any substance, solid is the heaviest and the smallest.  Once it expands to a liquid, it gets bigger, and once it expands to a gas, it gets bigger.  Follow?  Okay, now let's take water.  If water turned to ice as a solid, and it followed the path of all other solids, it would get heavier and smaller and would sink.  What would happen to all the fish in the world if in the winter all the ice sank?  We would have no fish.  So if we are going to have fish stay alive in the winter, God's going to have to do solids, liquids, and gases different with water than with other types of substances.  So guess what happens when water melts or water freezes?  It expands, and it floats.  The exact thing necessary to keep fish alive.  Now does not it take a genius to design a system like that?  So if you want to read Job 26, it goes through creating the universe, the water, the oceans, all of that.  And then it says this, these are but a whisper of God's power.

Now, I am not saying that you have to be a genius to do that.

But you have to know that God's power is the greatest power.  In other words, this is just the smallest little piece of God's power.

But then it goes on to say, but the thunder of His power, who can begin to know that?  If we can hardly get our minds around a whisper of God's power, just think if we understood perfectly the greatness of God's power, we just would not have a brain that could fathom it.  And so that takes us back to Psalm 8.  And I think of this kind of great God with this genius, brilliant mind that can design a system that keeps life happening on planet Earth and factors in a hundred different things.  That is a great big God.  The fact that He even cares about me and notices me and wants a relationship with me, that is mind-boggling.  And that becomes one of the greatest healers of shame.
