I want to look tonight at another one of the characteristics of complex trauma and its burnout.  It seems that most people with complex trauma, especially more severe complex trauma, often end up burning out.  And what's really interesting to me as I talk to clients who are taking our online program who come from all over the world is that burnout is an issue all around the world.  Even in countries that will not admit that they might have addiction issues in their country are admitting that they have burnout issues.

Let me just give you some statistics that I have come across.

So, 2024 survey by the Boston Consulting Group revealed that nearly half or so 48% of workers across eight countries reported experiencing burnout.  That's almost half of the workforce.  That's a serious issue.  Australia has been identified as the most burnt out nation globally with 50% one and two individuals affected by excessive and prolonged stress leading to mental exhaustion and lack of motivation.  Amongst physicians, the American Medical Association reports that almost half of doctors are reporting being burnt out.  Managerial stress in me equilibrium indicated that 36% of managers reported feeling burnt out in 2024 with 24% considering quitting their jobs, underscoring the pressures faced by those in leadership positions.  This has led to major impact on productivity as you can imagine.

So, approximately 85% of businesses reported decreased employee productivity over the past year and cited burnout as the major factor.  Even among businesses with higher productivity, 64% acknowledged burnout's negative impact.

So, causing huge problems in the workforce for companies to be productive to be profitable.

So, we are seeing it's a huge, huge problem in our world today.  Just to break this down and some of you will find this interesting.  Millennials so people 27 to 42 are reported to be the highest level of burnout at 55% of Millennials claiming to be burned out.  Amongst generation Z or Z, age is 18 to 26, about 51% generation X, 43 to 58, about 32% and baby booners, age 59 and older, about 24%.

So, the younger generations are the ones struggling with burnout the most.  And then amongst genders, the rate of women-expering burnout increased to 42% in 2024 up from 38% the previous year.  Well, the rate for men decreased to 30% from 33%.

So, what we are seeing is a growing gender gap.  More women experiencing burnout than men.

So, again, what's always interesting to me when we get into discussions of burnout and we are going to really explore this today, because I think so much of burnout, the root issue is really a complex trauma issue, but when you talk to people as to what is the cause of the burnout, what are the contributing factors?  Here's what they say.

So, the primary contributors to burnout among Canadian professionals included heavy workloads due to under-staff teams.

So, 52% claim that.  Lack of communication and managerial support, 42% claim that.  Missing tools or resources required to perform their jobs effectively, 39% claim that.

Now, why this is such an important topic for me is because I have gone through a major burnout.  It was really the lowest part of my life.  It was a turning point in my life.  It's actually what eventually led me into this field.

So, I have first-hand experience, but what I want you to understand is that when I was going through burnout, so this is 30 years ago, I did not even know it was burnout.  I did not even have the knowledge, the doctors did not have the knowledge to diagnose it correctly.  And I did not even begin to realize that it was connected to my own complex trauma.  It took me years to be able to figure that out.  And once I began to see it, it was like, wow, it all makes sense.

But I spent many years chasing all kinds of things to explain why I was so tired, why I was just really struggling, had depression issues, et cetera.

And so, what I have begun to realize, as I have worked in this field, is our culture still often misdiagnoses burnout.

So, they will call it something else, or they just look for an explanation that's based on your external circumstances.  You have got too much stress, your job's not good, your marriage has got too much conflict, got too much financial worry.  All of those externals are said to be the contributing main causes of your burnout.

But what I want to show us today, and hopefully you can see it, is that it's underlying issues that cause those surface external things to carry so much weight and wears down, and that underlying issue is complex trauma related.  There's another observation I have had over the years, and that is that many people are not even aware that they are close to burnout.  They are starting to burnout, but they are not even aware of what's happening.  It's so sad to watch.  And as a part of that can be kind of being burnt out, it's been they are normal for so long, they just think they are normal, or they just think they are tired and they are just lazy.  That's what they have always been told.  If you were not so lazy, you would not be feeling this way or acting this way.  And so they feel guilty now, or there's a fear to even be honest about how they are really feeling, but I am not doing well.  I am falling apart.  I am about to lose it.  There's a fear of going there and being honest about it, because there's still a fear that there's a stigma attached, that they are lazy, they are not productive, they are just not carrying their weight, or they are a single parent.  And it's like, if I burn out, what's going to happen to my kids?  So I cannot be honest about it.  How will I pay the bills?  Will my kids be taken from me?  I have to fight this fight, this fight this, which ends up making it worse.  So let's begin with the definition of burnout.  So burnout is a state of chronic, so ongoing physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion, caused by prolonged and excessive stress.  It often arises when individuals feel overwhelmed, emotionally drained, and unable to meet constant demands.  It might be helpful for you to make a distinction into kind of two types of burnout.  They are connected, but sometimes we see the one before we see the other.  And that is emotional burnout and physical burnout.  So just because so many people do not even know that they are burning out and do not know how to detect the warning signs that they are burning out, or the indicators that they have burned out, let me just walk through a bunch of symptoms that you might have that are indicating you are on your way to burnout, or you have burned out.  And you can just go through these.  And if you have a lot of these true of you, then you need to be looking at the possibility that you are on your way to burnout, or you have burned out.  So physical symptoms, persistent tiredness, even after a good night's sleep, you wake up tired.  Sleep issues.  You have difficulty falling asleep, staying asleep.  You sleep for a couple hours and then you are awake the rest of the night.  You do not feel refreshed after you sleep.  And then headaches, muscle tension.  So frequent aches in your neck, shoulders, back, that can be a key indicator.  Frequent illness.  So your whole immune system is just run down.  And so you have more colds and infections, other ailments, or appetite changes.  So you just do not, you are not hungry.  You just do not have an appetite, or you just want to eat all the time.  Then some emotional signs.  So increased irritability, frustration.  You just do not have patience with people.  You get anger, angry over the smallest little things.  Before you have this growing anxiety inside of you, you are just constantly on edge, constantly wanting to avoid or run.  Or you have a low mood, kind of early signs of depression.  You just, there's a bit more hopelessness, a bit of apathy, just not feeling very positive.  Or a detachment, a sense of emotional numbness.  You just do not feel or you just want to withdraw from people.  You just do not want to be around anything.  Or feelings of inadequacy, just growing self-doubt, growing feelings of failure, even in successful moments.  Or you dry it, cry at the drop of a hat.  All of a sudden you just watch it commercial on TV and you are bawling.  Like that's not your normal.  There's something going on emotionally that you just do not have the normal emotional responses.  And then for many, there's some cognitive changes that are happening as well.  So you get a brain fog.  You have trouble processing stuff, thinking of words.  It's like you are walking in wet cement.  Your brain is fuzzy and you have trouble concentrating, difficulty focusing on tasks, frequently losing your train of thought, memory problems.  You forget or struggle with stuff that happened just yesterday.  Just your memory is not as sharp as it normally is.  Or now you are more indecisive.  You just have trouble with choices and you often feel very paralyzed in knowing how to make a choice and what's the right choice.  Or you become more negative in your thinking.  You dwell on worst case scenarios.  You find fault with everything.  You can testify.  You are just very critical of everything.  You just get in that very negative mindset.  And then there's some indicators in your behavior.  So you tend to start procrastinating.  You avoid tasks, even very simple ones.  You are just not motivated to do anything.  Or you start with drawing from friends and family and colleagues.  You just isolate more.  You do not want to be with people.  Or you avoid going to work.  How can I get out of work?  So you call in sick more frequently.  Or you show up late or leave early if possible.  Or some go to the other extreme and they just push themselves, drive themselves.  And they overwork.  So now it's almost like I feel guilty.  I am so tired and I have not been doing my job as well as I should.  So I now need to drive myself.  And they just work long hours in a robotic way.  Or they start neglecting self care.  They just I am going to stay up on night and work and then they do not sleep.  They do not eat.  They do not exercise.  They do not relax.  They are unable to relax.  Something just will not release inside of them and let go so they can relax.  Then some relational indicators.  So increase conflict in your relationships.  More arguments, more tension is happening in relationships.  We have talked about more irritability, but now there's some more anger outbursts happening.  Then many just do not want physical intimacy anymore.  Or they want it all the time.  Or you avoid problems.  You just do not want to deal with anything.  You just do not have the energy to deal with anything.  So you really go into this avoid approach to life.  Before you just now you isolate.  You just start pulling inward with drawing from others not wanting to connect what not wanting to be present.  And you become just very isolated internally.  And then you isolate yourself in relationships and social settings.  Some develop a real resentment within relationships.  You feel unappreciated.  You feel overbought burdened by that your friends do not have your back.  Your friends are not supporting you properly.  And you develop a real resentment.  Then there's decreased performance and engagement.  And so there's just this lack of motivation starts settling in.  You just do not have the energy.  So you lose enthusiasm for tasks often that once inspired you.  And that results in reduced productivity.  You just struggle to complete tasks.  You can start stuff but just cannot get around to finishing it.  Or you just develop this total disinterest in work and all the hobbies that you used to enjoy.  And then again you procrastinate.  And then just greater and greater cynicism.  So you are just growing in this negativity pessimism.  You just see the worst in situations, the worst in life, the worst in people.  You disengage, you become very sarcastic and even hostile about life and about people and about relationships.  So there's just this growing negative cynicism.  So I want to talk about what causes burnout.  So I am going to look at it at three levels.  So I am going to start with what people talk about.  And it's the external circumstances.  Then I am going to go below that and then down to the complex trauma stuff that really in my mind sets up people to burnout.

But let's look at what people would say are external circumstances.  And these definitely contribute.  These definitely feed into leading to burnout.  So they do need to be talked about.  So work related.  So if you are in a toxic work environment, where office politics, there's bullying, there's poor management, that's going to take its toll and where you down and could lead to burnout.  Or if you are in a work environment where there's an excessive workload where you are expected to work 60, 80 hours a week, you have unrealistic deadlines placed on you.  And then inadequate resources to do the work asked of you, that's going to wear you out.  Or if you are in an environment where you lack control in making decisions.  So everybody else is making decisions for you.  And you cannot say no to that, that's going to wear you out.  Or if you are in an environment where there's unclear expectation.  So just here's a very general job.  Do it.  And nobody gives you clear guidance.  And you are afraid to ask that, it's just going to take its toll on you.  Or if you are in an environment where you are really working hard, but nobody's appreciating it, nobody's recognizing it, you feel undervalued, underappreciated, unnoticed.

But yet there's this high expectation.  And if you ever make a mistake of something you are noticed, that's going to take its toll on you.  Or if you are in an environment with poor working conditions, that's going to take its toll on you.  Or if you are in an environment where there's just no resources to do your job, that's going to take its toll.  Or if you are in a job where that's very monotonous, you just repeat, repeat, repeat the same task over and over and over again.  And it's not meaningful work.  You feel like a robot, that's going to take its toll.  Or if you are in a job where you are trying to do your job, but you are constantly being interrupted so that you are pulled in all these different directions and you cannot do your job, that's going to take its toll.  So work definitely plays a part.  Then relationship stuff.  So conflict not being resolved and more conflict than there is fun, that wears you down.  Or caregiving responsibilities, your single mom, or your stay at home mom, and your partners away a lot.  And you have got four children, and there's a lot of responsibility.  Or you have got elderly parents to take care of, or loved ones with special needs.  That gradually takes its toll.  Or you are isolated.  So you move to a different country or a different part of the country, you have no friends, no family, you just feel very much alone, no meaningful connections to help you, that takes its toll.  Then there's an element of societal cultural pressures that can feed into burnout.  So economic pressure, you have to have a certain salary in order to pay rent, to buy food, but the cost of living keeps going up, and you are struggling to meet your own basic needs, that takes its toll.  Then there's societal expectations.  So you go to certain neighborhoods, and all the kids are involved in all the sports, all the extra curricular activities, and you feel that to fit in and be a part of that community, you need to get your kids involved in all of that stuff.  Or you move into an area where everybody's got a boat and a cottage and a pool and all kinds of really nice things, and you feel, again, a pressure that you have to fit in by meeting these expectations that are very subtle, but they are there.  Or for some people, we would call it a digital overload.  You are constantly working on technology.  You are constantly, that's part of your job, but then you do it to communicate to people, to connect with people, then you do it for some entertainment, but the digital overload can take its toll on you.  Then for others, you live in an environment where there is discrimination and inequity.  There's racism.  There's bias.  There's unfair treatment.  You are not included in stuff.  You are looked down on, you are not given fair treatment.  That takes its toll.  And then for others, they are in a war zone, and life is just bombs and bullets, and it's a scary, scary world, and that takes its toll.  So that's kind of the external environment, and it does contribute to it.  Because all of those things, if you look at them, they add distress, and they make your brain eventually start to feel overwhelmed and unsafe, and that's what leads to burnout.  So let me take it a lower level to the next level, and that is what's going on below the surface.  That's causing a person to not respond as well as they should to some of these external causes.  Because many people will go through these external causes and never get burned out, because they have tools, and they have the underlying internal health to not be overwhelmed by it.  So somebody has said there's kind of eight types of people set up for burnout.  So number one is the overgiver.  You just give, give, give, give.  Your needs do not matter.  You just have to love, love, love people.  They burn out.  There's the overdoer.  You accomplish, you accomplish your whole value comes from accomplishing stuff.  That gets you validation.  Then there's the overachiever, where you have to be better than everybody.  You have to be top of your class, the best in your office.  That can lead to burnout.  Then there's the overthinker.  You got to figure out every problem.  You got to anticipate every problem.  Your brain is constantly, constantly obsessing and working on stuff.  Then there's the micromanager.  You got to make sure every detail is under control, is the way it should be, so that there's no failures, so that you do not get hurt, so that there's nothing unexpected.  That happens.  The micromanager.  Then the perfectionist.  You got to do everything perfectly to think you are good enough to get respect.  Then the workaholic.  You are all your value comes from your job, and so you must work, work, work to prove how valuable you are and get validation.  Then the people please are.  Your value comes from other people liking you, other people being pleased with you, with you doing what they want.  As you can see, all of those, if those are true of you, then you get an external environment and you got problems because you cannot say no.  You cannot turn your brain off.  You cannot just say, hey, I am only going to work these amount of hours.  No, I got to prove my worth.  There's something going on below the surface that's causing people to be overgivers, to be overdoers, to be overachievers, to be overthinkers, to be micromanagers.  That's the complex trauma stuff.  Before I go on to that, let me just put it kind of this way.  If you take the underlying issues, what you see is a person who has chronic stress issues, a person who possibly has codependency issues, which leads to compassion, fatigue, so they are so exposed to other people's sufferings, and they do not know how to detach from that, and it burns them out, or they have boundary issues, so they do not know how to say no, they do not know how to set good boundaries or enforce boundaries, or they do not know how to take care of themself.  They can meet everybody else's needs, but they do not know how to meet their own needs, or they feel guilty for meeting their own needs.  So now we are getting to some of those core issues that come out of complex trauma.  So let's go to this, because to me it's complex trauma that creates those issues, that then when you get in the external environment you do not know how to handle properly, and then you burn out.  So we have used this diagram before, so on the right is healthy nervous system, healthy engagement with life.  So the performance zone, you go into your sympathetic nervous system, it gives you energy to work hard to do your job, but then you go to the blue, which is the recovery zone, where you go into your parasympathetic nervous system, and that brings rest, healing, rejuvenation, and now you have a very balanced healthy life.  Sympathetic nervous system, parasympathetic nervous system, working in balance, creating a very healthy life, you do not burn out, but then you come to the complex trauma side on the left.  You are in constant stress, constant danger, constant overwhelm, so you are constantly in your sympathetic nervous system.  You are not able to go to your parasympathetic nervous system, because you are constantly in danger, you are constantly stressed, you got to stay in your sympathetic nervous system.  So eventually you are only way your brain can find a way to not to survive, is to burn out, to shut down.  That's what's happening.  It's the brain's last recourse to prevent you from killing yourself, to prevent you from just burning everything up.  So let's just start refusing to cooperate, let's go on strike, let's shut her down.  So let me just break that down a little bit more.  So as a person is in danger, stress overwhelmed, they are in their sympathetic nervous system, but the brain is also releasing a chemicals at that time to help give you extra energy.  So it releases cortisol, adrenaline, and that gives you extra energy to fight flight, to survive in that danger stress zone.  Some people actually then add other chemicals when they feel themselves getting tired, when they feel themselves wearing out, I just need more coffee, I just need more sugar.  Their body begins digging into all of its energy reserves, trying to keep you going.  So what you can see is you are trying to fuel this energy, you are trying to put stuff in the gas tank, but it's not healthy stuff.  Your body is drawing on reserves that it has.  You keep just pushing yourself, pushing yourself, but never letting yourself rest.  Never letting yourself go to your parasympathetic nervous system.  Now what's important to understand is that a lot of people actually, there's something in them that likes this digging deeper.  They get a rush out of it.  They feel in the zone when they dig deeper and so they go along with this.  Some people even get to the point where they are so tired, they are so exhausted that they now resort to drugs.  So this is where people turn to crystal meth.  They turn to cocaine.  It gives them energy.  It's a stimulant drug that helps them keep going.  So that's happening.  The body's burning out.  You are doing everything you can to keep it going, but all of those are only hurting the body even more.  The brain is basically saying this person is refusing to go into their parasympathetic nervous system or they cannot because life is too dangerous and stressful.  I need to help.  So the first thing the brain often does is it brings about depression.  So depression is actually the brain trying to help a person get to their parasympathetic nervous system.  I am going to start kind of shutting down.  I am going to start numbing out.  I am going to take the motivation away from life to help you get to your parasympathetic nervous system.  Sadly for many people, they are depressed now, but they keep pushing themselves.  No.  I got to do this.  I got to keep going.  I got to keep going.  So they ignore that.  The brains attempt to help them and keep pushing.  And so eventually the body then just goes on strike.  We cannot go anymore or exhausted.  We are just falling apart.  We are saying no.  We quit.  And that's burnout.  The body is no longer cooperating with what the brain wants to do.  So if you have gone through that and you have pushed yourself for a long time as you were getting warning signs that you were in trouble, but you kept pushing yourself, what then happened?  So that basically you have gone into not just burnout, but you have been living in trauma in complex trauma for a long period of time.  So there's a whole bunch of negative ramifications that come out of this.  So number one is you created a default setting through all those years of being in a unsafe environment, a stress environment, an overwhelming environment where you were in your sympathetic nervous system all the time.  That became your default setting.  That became what feels normal.  So now if you were to go to your parasympathetic nervous system, that just feels boring.  That just feels dead.  There's something in you that wants to go back to being in your sympathetic nervous system all the time because that feels alive.  And so that's where people become addicted to chaos because that gets them back into their sympathetic nervous system and makes them feel alive.  So that default setting is no longer a healthy balance between sympathetic and nervous system.  Your default setting is now an out-of-balance nervous system and that's dangerous.  The second thing is because of being in danger for so long in complex trauma, your stress system is now easily activated.  So now in recovery, you can go through a situation and the slightest bit of increase in stress can send you right back into your sympathetic nervous system and start all of those other dynamics in motion.  There's another thing that's happened through all of those years of doing that and that have led to burnout is that complex trauma has constantly created an internal message that I am not good enough.  I must be an imposter.  I am a failure.  I am a loser.  I do not have value.  Others are going to reject me if they see the real me.  A shame belief develops.  And that then actually causes people to have that next layer.  So if you look those eight types of people, the people please are the perfectionist.  All of them are trying to solve shame.  If I just work harder, I will have value.  If I am overachiever, I will have value.  If I please everybody, I will have value.  If I am perfect, I will have value.  If I overthink everything and figure everything out, then I will have value.  All of those are trying to solve shame.  There's another default setting that I want you to understand.  So you got a default setting of a sympathetic nervous system that's always activated.

But with that, you got a default setting now of shame and a default setting of fear because of living in danger so long, I know I am pretty sure something bad is going to happen.  I know I am pretty sure that the other shoe is going to drop.  I am going to fail.  I am going to get rejected.  I am going to get hurt.  I am going to get abandoned.  I am going to be disrespected.  And so I am constant anxiety about all the bad things that could happen because they happened in the past.  They happened and caused my complex trauma.  That anxiety takes a ton of emotional energy.  Then there's another piece that comes out of complex trauma for a lot of people.  And this was part of my burnout.  And that was some bad teaching.  So I was basically told that to be loving meant I never had any needs.  I could not stand up for myself.  I should not take care of myself and do self care because I was being selfish and self-centered.  I needed to give, give, give or I was not being a loving person.  That was bad teaching.  That was not actually teaching love.  It was teaching codependency and calling it love.  Also, I got teaching that if I relax, then I was being lazy.  If I relax, I was being selfish.  I needed to work work work because that's what productive healthy people do is that solid work ethic.  And so that teaching caused me to have false guilt whenever I took care of myself.  It caused me to have false guilt whenever I did said no to anybody.  And so bad teaching can cause people to have false guilt which then sets them up to be people pleasers to do all of those eight things.

Another thing is for some people, there's unresolved healthy guilt.  So they have stolen and lied and cheated for years but never owned it.  Never truly changed.  And they are still that's annoying at them.  That's eating away at them.  That takes a lot of emotional energy and can contribute to burnout stuff.  So what I hope you see it's complex trauma created some core issues that became default settings.  Shame, fear, false guilt, true guilt.  That if it's not dealt with will lead to people pleasing, workaholism, those eight characteristics.  And then when you are in external environments in your adult life that are stressful, you will not be able to handle them properly and you are burnout.  So that three levels that all feed into burnout is so important to see.  Some of you might go wow, I think maybe I am heading to burnout.  I just had not seen the warning signs.  I need to take action.  Others of you are going wow, I think I am burnout.  That's why I have been feeling the way I have for so long.  What do I do?  How do I heal?  How do I change this?  So let me give you a series of pieces to this healing journey that I hope will be helpful and just understand this takes time.  You do not recover from burnout in a week or a month.  This is a long journey.  It took me years to recover.  So begin with pausing and reflecting.  So acknowledge the signs, the symptoms, the warning signs that you are burning out, but do not go to judgment.  Do not go on a terrible personal.  I cannot do not get down on yourself.  Burnout is not a personal failure.  Burnout is I did not get the tools and internal stuff I needed to handle life.  Do not punish the child for what you are experiencing today.  Secondly, identify stressors.  So what is on the external causing me the most stress right now that's using the most emotional energy that's causing me to feel overwhelmed?  Is it my job?  Is it my relationship?  Identify that.

But then go to the underlying issues.  What is this showing about my wounds, my trauma?  What patterns am I seeing?  What core issues are feeding into the way I am responding to these external stressors?  That's where I need to heal.  That's where I need to learn healthy tools because if I just deal with external stressors, but I do not change that deep core stuff, I will just be back in the exact same spot a month from now.  I got to get to understand what are the core issues here.

Let me emphasize again, the key attitude in healing from burnout is self-compassion.  The old approach of I just need to push myself harder.  I just need to be hard on myself.  That's not going to work here.  You have to flip that and become compassionate to yourself.  I hope you see one of the biggest things to heal if you are going to ever deal with this whole burnout problem properly is your shame because so much of which drives burnout is shame issues.  Heal your shame and again, our course lift spends so much time in helping people understand their shame and heal their shame.  It's just such a core central issue.  What you are then going to need to do is some very practical stuff and you are not going to be able to do it unless you heal your shame.  First is you are going to have to become really good at boundaries.  So when I was coming out of burnout, what I began to realize is why was not I setting boundaries as well as I should?  Well, there was some bad teaching and there was some shame issues.  So if I did not learn to set boundaries, I would just burn out again.  That meant I needed to heal some shame issues and correct some bad teaching, but then I had to get really good at saying no.  I had to get really good at figuring out what I could handle, what I could not handle and setting boundaries to protect myself and keep myself safe.  And that was not just activities.  That was allowing people into my life.  Certain people, no, sorry, cannot come in.  Certain people wanted deeper friendships.  No, cannot do that.  Going to stay superficial friendship.  All of that became so important.  And so that, again, the false guild is that bad teaching.  I had to go back to confronting some of the lies that I was taught as truth that I had believed that set me up and that took a lot of work.  Next that I had to do was become an expert at mindfulness.  So part of what happens when you are pushing yourself, when you are digging deeper, is you actually become unaware of your body sensations, a lot of your emotions.  You disconnect in order to survive.  Now you have to get good at connecting again.  And I had to learn to spend time every day, just one of my feelings, what emotions that are going on, what is the severity of those emotions?  Is that a one out of ten or a ten out of ten?  I had to begin to listen to my emotions, but listen to my body as well.  And listen to the sensations that my body was experiencing, pain in my body.  Then the next thing I had to do was I had to re-evaluate my priorities.  So I cannot please everybody.  Who then is the most important people that I please?  What need to be the priorities of my life?  Because I have limitations.  I cannot do everything.  I am not super man with a cape.  I need X amount of sleep.  I need to be in decent physical shape.  Because if I am not, then a lot of my symptoms come back.  I need a certain amount of downtime every day.  Those are the priorities.  I need to do things every day that feed my soul.  I need to develop a routine and habits that meet my 12 needs.  That has to be my priority.  Because what I realized is you cannot pour water from an empty cup.  If I do not take care of myself, I am no good to anybody.  I cannot give to anybody.  So a priority is I have to meet my own 12 needs, healthy self-care, healthy self-love before I can love anybody else before I can perform.  So how do I have the balance to love self and love others?

But how do I make that a priority?  What does that look like?  And that required a ton of thinking.  What I also did in a very practical way is every time I got a request from somebody, would you do this for me?  Would you come and speak at this?  Often I would, my initial response would want to be just say yes.  Then everybody's happy, excited.

But what I realized is if I did that, then often I get too busy again.  Too much on my plate, get stressed out.  So I just started saying, would you give me a couple days to think about it?  And I will get back to you.  That helped me so much.  And then I would talk to somebody about it, like my wife or somebody that knew me well and just said, I got asked to do this.  I am undecided what are your thoughts and get their feedback.  So if I can just restate this, but I am going to do it because it's so important.  What I realized was my life is built on a foundation.  And that is if I do not get good sleep, everything falls apart.  If I do not meet my 12 needs, everything falls apart.  So I had to prioritize my physical, emotional needs that were so essential for everything else.  It all was built on that.  And so just realized that your self-care is this important foundation.  Then it was very important for me to reach out for some help.  I could not just solve this on my own.  I needed friends.  I need family.  I needed a therapist.  I needed resources and books and videos to watch that just helped me to understand all that led to my burnout tools for getting healthy again.  Just take advantage of resources and get yourself plugged into key resources.  Then it's really important to understand that there's been so much research that's developed in the last few years in this area.  And so it's realizing that what a person has burnt out often top-down approaches where you just learn new information.  They have value, but they are not sufficient.  You have to have some bottom-up approaches.  You have to do activity type therapy, so somatic therapy, polyvagal therapies, things that help calm your nervous system, rebalance your nervous system, get you into your parasympathetic nervous system, bring healing to your body that helps then heal your emotions.  And we have done talks on all of these different types of therapies, but just begin to look into those type of somatic therapies that are very helpful for you.  So it leads to one final question.  And I get asked this all the time.  Does a person who's burnt out ever fully recover?  And I go, yes and no.  So from my own experience, I recovered in the sense that I got stable again.  I was able to be productive again.  I was able to be what I wanted to be in many senses.

But it's not that I am 100% recovered.  I think some permanent damage that has come out of that burnout experience.  And part of what that is is, if I am now in a stressful situation for too long, it's, I just go downhill, like really quick, all my old symptoms come back in a heartbeat.  So there's, I am fragile.  There's a fragility there.  I am vulnerable.  I have limitations that I never had before.  So I can still be stable and do really, really well.  And so in a sense, I have recovered, but in a sense, there's been some permanent damage that I need to be aware of that now restricts me like I was not before.  That is to me so important.  So if a person does not pay attention to those limitations to their fragility, to those restrictions, to how vulnerable they are, and they do not set healthy boundaries, they do not do healthy self-care.  They start to push themselves again in too much stress.  You are going to burn out again.  And what concerns me is if you burn out a second time or a third time, you may not bounce back this time.  You may too much damage may be done.  So this is not some light little thing we are playing with.  This is not like I broke a bone.  Okay, everything's going to be back to normal.  And if I break it again, yes, I will put a cast on and be back to normal again.  No, each time greater and greater damage is done.  So that's our look at burnout.  I hope that helps you.  I hope for those of you who are on the way to burnout, who are burned out, you do get some hope from this.  You do get some insight into what caused it where you need to focus your healing attention.  It is possible to come out of it.  And I would say that in coming out of the burnout in my own life, it has led to some good stuff that I never probably would have had unless I would gone through the burnout.  So it can be if you do it properly, it can turn into a positive, but it takes a lot of work and a lot of time.  So that's the end of another Friday night.  I again, thank you for being here.  Hope that was helpful.
