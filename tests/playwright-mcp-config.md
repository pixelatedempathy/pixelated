# Playwright MCP Server Configuration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the configuration plan for integrating the Playwright MCP (Model Context Protocol) server with our existing testing infrastructure. The MCP server will enable AI-powered testing of our application, with a focus on critical user flows and integration with our AI features.

## Background

The Playwright MCP server allows Large Language Models (LLMs) to interact with web browsers programmatically, enabling capabilities such as:
- Automated navigation through our application
- Form filling and interaction with UI elements
- Screenshot capture for visual verification
- DOM inspection and accessibility testing
- Testing of AI features in our application

## Integration Requirements

The integration of the Playwright MCP server with our existing systems requires:

1. **Server Configuration**
   - Configure the MCP server to work with our Astro application
   - Ensure proper authentication for protected routes
   - Set up proper environment handling (dev, test, prod)

2. **Test Coverage**
   - Create example tests for critical user flows
   - Develop tests specific to AI feature integration
   - Ensure security testing for sensitive operations

3. **CI/CD Integration**
   - Configure GitHub Actions for automated testing
   - Set up result reporting and artifact storage
   - Implement failure notifications

## Configuration Details

### Server Configuration

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 8033,
    "host": "localhost"
  },
  "playwright": {
    "headless": true,
    "timeout": 30000,
    "retries": 2,
    "baseURL": "http://localhost:3000"
  },
  "logging": {
    "level": "info",
    "console": true,
    "file": "logs/mcp-playwright.log"
  },
  "screenshots": {
    "dir": "test-results/screenshots",
    "fullPage": true
  },
  "auth": {
    "username": "${MCP_AUTH_USERNAME}",
    "password": "${MCP_AUTH_PASSWORD}"
  },
  "security": {
    "allowedOrigins": ["http://localhost:3000"],
    "maxSessions": 5
  }
}
```

### Test Example Structure

For each critical user flow, we will implement a test following this structure:

```typescript
// Example test for authentication flow
test('Authentication keeps user logged in', async ({ page }) => {
  // Setup
  await page.goto('/auth/login');

  // Test actions
  await page.fill('input[name="email"]', 'test@example.com');
  await page.fill('input[name="password"]', 'password123');
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]');

  // Wait for navigation
  await page.waitForURL('/dashboard');

  // Verify persistence
  await page.reload();

  // Assertions
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/dashboard');
  await expect(page.locator('h1')).toContainText('Dashboard');
});
```

### GitHub Actions Configuration

```yaml
name: Playwright MCP Tests

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, dev ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    timeout-minutes: 30

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
          cache: 'pnpm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: pnpm install

      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps

      - name: Build app
        run: pnpm build

      - name: Start MCP server
        run: pnpm run mcp:start

      - name: Run Playwright tests
        run: pnpm run test:e2e:mcp

      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
          retention-days: 30
```

## Implementation Steps

1. **Initial Setup** âœ…
   - Research Playwright MCP server requirements
   - Evaluate integration options with existing systems
   - Review configuration examples and best practices
   - Identify key user flows for testing

2. **Configuration Implementation** (In Progress)
   - Create configuration file with environment-specific settings
   - Set up authentication for protected routes
   - Configure screenshot and logging directories
   - Establish security boundaries

3. **Test Implementations** (Planned)
   - Create example tests for authentication flows
   - Implement tests for core dashboard functionality
   - Develop tests for AI feature interactions
   - Set up tests for security checks

4. **CI/CD Integration** (Planned)
   - Configure GitHub Actions workflow for automated testing
   - Set up artifacts for test results and screenshots
   - Implement notification system for test failures
   - Add scheduling for periodic test runs

## Test Scope

The following user flows will be covered by the MCP server tests:

1. **Authentication Flows**
   - User registration
   - Login with email/password
   - Password reset process
   - "Remember me" functionality
   - Session persistence

2. **Dashboard Functionality**
   - Loading and rendering of dashboard components
   - Navigation between dashboard sections
   - Interactive data visualization
   - Profile management

3. **AI Feature Testing**
   - Emotion analysis processing
   - Pattern recognition
   - AI-assisted documentation
   - Risk level assessment
   - Alert system functionality

4. **Security Testing**
   - CSRF protection
   - Authentication token handling
   - Access control for protected routes
   - Input validation

## Next Steps

1. Complete the configuration implementation for the MCP server
2. Create example tests for critical user flows
3. Integrate with GitHub Actions for automated testing
4. Expand test coverage to include all AI features
