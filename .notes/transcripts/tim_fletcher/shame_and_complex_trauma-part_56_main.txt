Okay, we're almost done this series on shame.

And like I said in the previous talks, when I teach shame at React, we do a whole week on it.

It is one of the heaviest weeks for clients as they begin to realize how much shame they have.

Because for them, it's something that's always operated at a subconscious level.

And it's impacted them.

They just haven't been aware of it.

And as they become aware of it, it just really gets heavy for them.

And what I hear starting on Tuesday is, when are you going to tell us how to heal from shame?

When are you going to tell us how to heal from shame?

And I said, not until you sit in it for a while and let me diagnose it and really convince you as to how screwed up you are.

And that you understand just how big this issue is.

So tonight I want to come to the healing from shame.

And we're only going to do one part tonight.

And then next Friday we're going to do the rest of the healing from shame.

And I hope it is a very helpful thing for you.

And what, again, we've said in all of the talks, in my mind it is the greatest negative consequence of complex trauma.

And it has the greatest...

greatest negative impact on a person's life.

Because what shame is, is a core belief about yourself.

And it's a core belief that is negative.

It is a core belief that says, I don't think I'm good enough.

I think the reason I was rejected, abandoned, abused, neglected, is because I must have something wrong with me that makes me unlovable and I don't have any value.

And that core belief begins to morph in all kinds of different...

directions and affects all your adult relationships, your coping, the messages that go on in your head.

And it's all negative.

And so what do we do to begin to heal?

So what I want to do is, what I do with the clients, is the first step of healing is to begin to understand what happens or has been happening at a subconscious level in your...

life.

So what I do is I put a diagram on the board and I say, your shame can be triggered in hundreds of different ways.

And I'm going to go through some of that.

And once it's triggered, your shame is triggered, that triggers a whole bunch of systems inside of you.

And once that trigger happens, what follows from that is something that can happen in a nanosecond.

But for most...

people, it will follow a pattern.

So when your shame is triggered, it will trigger certain types of thoughts.

It'll affect how you think.

And so you could be thinking in a very healthy way.

Once your shame is triggered, your thoughts go in a very negative direction.

But it doesn't just affect your thinking.

It brings up other emotions, none of them positive, all of them negative, and they feed your thinking and make it even more...

negative.

Which...

creates even more negative emotions and it starts feeding off of itself.

And then that leads to actions, things that you do when you feel that shame trigger.

And all of them are negative as well.

And they feed the thoughts and emotions in a more negative way.

And so you set up a system that only gets worse and worse inside of you.

And it doesn't resolve the shame problem.

And so you have to start by understanding that system.

And here's the main reason why.

Everybody has a pattern.

And so it might start with thoughts and emotions and then it goes to behaviors.

And the longer you're in shame, those behaviors become like dominoes.

They start falling.

And if you stay in shame and don't resolve it, the dominoes usually will lead to a relapse.

And so for most people...

without even realizing it, shame is one of their initial dominoes on the road to a relapse.

Or it could lead to acting out in self-destructive ways, harmful ways to yourself and to your relationships.

So the earlier you can catch your pattern and stop the dominoes, the easier it will be to turn it around.

But if you don't stop the dominoes, there comes a line.

And once you cross that line, it's a line of no return.

You are going to do something destructive to yourself.

Either a relapse or something else.

So the whole point of self-awareness is to understand your triggers.

Understand how they affect you so that you can begin to change them.

And begin to stop them because they are nothing but a series of triggers.

And that's what we're going to do.

And that's what we're going to do.

We're going to do a series of negative things.

So let's go through the things tonight.

And you can again do a self-evaluation.

You can put check marks by the ones that would be your shame triggers.

So by a shame trigger, I am referring to anything that makes you feel less than, not good enough, inferior, bad, not lovable.

Rejected.

All of those things.

So they can come in two ways.

They can come from people or they can come from events.

So let's begin with the triggers that people can produce in you.

So let's say somebody asks you to do a job.

And you do it for them.

And when they look at the job you do, you can see disappointment in their eye.

What just happened inside of you?

Your shame got triggered.

And all of a sudden you put your head down.

You feel insecure.

You can't look the person in the eye.

You can't wait to get out of there.

And you beat yourself up all day long.

That's what I mean by a shame trigger.

So anytime you see disappointment in somebody's eyes, that can be a powerful trigger.

Another one is you feel that something is wrong.

You feel that somebody is getting impatient with you because you're not catching on fast enough.

So they ask you to do something or they're trying to teach you a new skill.

And you realize you're not catching on and you think they're getting impatient and you start feeling shame.

Now some of that, they might not be impatient with you at all.

But you grew up where mom got impatient with you.

You didn't learn perfectly the first time.

And you think everybody is going to be impatient with you unless you learn perfectly or do it perfectly the first time.

So you then read shame in where there is really no shame.

It's just your past affecting you.

The next one, I don't know if this is true of you, but some people when you look at somebody and you're in pain or you're struggling, and you look at them and talk to them and you see pity in their eyes, you go to shame.

You don't feel that they love me or they care about you.

You feel I'm not good enough because I'm struggling so much and they pity me.

That can be a trigger.

If somebody sets a boundary with you, and we've talked about this, they say no, you can't come over, or no, I'm not going to go out for coffee with you.

You feel shame and conclude, it must be because I'm not good enough.

And you go to that shame place.

If you say something, so you're in a conversation with somebody, and you state something that you believe is a fact, and they say no, that's not right, and they correct you, some of you go to shame.

Or if you do a job and somebody says, can I give you some feedback?

You go, uh-oh, what did I do wrong?

And you go to shame.

If you've been working on something or doing something and somebody comes up to you and says, can I give you a suggestion?

You go to shame because all of that in your mind says, I'm not good enough.

I must be doing something wrong.

I must be doing a terrible job.

That's why they're making suggestions or giving me feedback.

If you're in a conversation with somebody and you're talking away and all of a sudden they talk over top of you, some of you might go to shame.

Or, you're talking to somebody and you're pretty sure they just rolled their eyes, or they actually rolled their eyes, some of you go to shame.

Now here's what some of you will do.

You don't like to feel shame, so you switch to a second emotion.

So that rolling your eyes is a good example.

What emotion do you go to immediately after you feel shame?

Anger.

Because you think if I'm feeling anger, then I won't feel the shame.

And I'll feel empowered.

So anger becomes a secondary emotion for a lot of people to cover the shame emotion when they feel it.

If somebody does something that in any way makes you feel stupid, you can go to shame.

So you're seeing there's all these different triggers.

So one of the things I ask clients is, how many times a day does your shame get triggered?

And some go, once a minute.

And I go, wow.

And if you start to think about that, you go, wow, when my shame gets triggered, we haven't even got to what that then triggers inside of you, but that's a lot of triggering happening.

Okay, next one, if you're talking with somebody, and they keep looking down at their phone, or you can tell their eyes are glazing over, they're not giving you their full attention, you can go to shame.

And you think it's all your fault.

Or if you hear anybody whispering, you're pretty sure they're talking about you.

And you go to shame.

Or if you hear two people laughing, you're pretty sure they're laughing at you.

And you can go to shame.

So again, it might not be true at all, but that's where your brain goes because of your history.

And what whispering meant and laughing meant when you were a child.

Next one, when others do a task better than you.

So you get asked to do something, and then somebody else gets asked to do something.

And what are you doing the whole time you're doing something?

It's comparing yourself to that person.

And you get to the end of it, and you realize they did a better job than I did, you can go to shame.

Or you come up with the greatest idea in the world, and you come to me and say, I have a great idea for finding freedom, and then I don't follow your advice.

Some of you can go to shame.

Disrespect is one of the biggest shame triggers for people, but they don't realize it because they go to anger so quickly once they're disrespected.

But shame is a part of that.

Any conflict with another person can create shame because you're thinking the reason we're having conflict is because I'm not doing anything.

I must be doing something wrong.

They're mad at me, so anger or anybody that's angry at you can trigger shame.

You might have somebody who you're in a serious debate with, and you're 100% sure you're right, and they're 100% sure they're right.

So let me give you an example from Kim and I.

So we're both pushing 60.

Our memories aren't what they used to be.

So I'm pretty sure I told her something she's pretty sure I didn't.

And we can argue for hours if we want to about it.

Yes, I told you.

No, you didn't.

So let's say she goes out and gets a whole bunch of proof somehow that I never told her.

And that proof now proves me wrong.

After I've argued so strongly that I've been right all along, now there's no doubt that I am wrong.

That can be a huge shame thing.

Another thing that people can do is body language.

So I ask clients all the time, what are body language things that produce shame?

So wagging the finger can be one.

Raising, mom raising her eyebrow.

Somebody sitting there with their arms crossed looking at you with their brow furrowed.

All of those things can produce or trigger shame.

How many of you have been trying to do something and all of a sudden you heard mom say, the sigh of exasperation.

That can produce shame in you today.

Or you have a friend and they're depressed or struggling and they're just not interested in talking to you, spending time with you.

They avoid you and you can go to shame.

You can take that personally.

Or something else.

Or somebody can, you get to a family reunion and some uncle will say, do you remember what you did when you were five years old?

And they drag out of the memory bank this very embarrassing thing you did when you were little and you can go right to shame.

This can be a long list, eh?

Realizing how many triggers, you realize I could have doubled this list if I wanted to?

I just knew you were going to get tired of it.

Okay, we're almost done it.

Twenty-eight in total.

Partner throws your past in your face.

Some of you will go to shame with that.

Partner gives you the silent treatment for a day or two.

Or withholds love from you.

You try to hug them and you hug an iceberg.

And there's nothing given back.

Some of you will go to shame.

Your parents, you're there visiting them and they take shots at you and keep putting you down.

That can be a big trigger.

Sometimes you hang around people who are very good living, but their nose is in the air that they're better than you.

Part of you is angry.

But there are some of you that can trigger your shame as well.

And you take that on.

Or you have people, your dad or your mom that say, how come you're still on EIA?

Don't you have a job yet?

Don't you know men should be providing for their families?

And they're judging you by a standard that they've made.

You can't get them to prove where that standard is anywhere.

They just say, well everybody knows this is the way it is.

And you feel judged.

Less than and it's a big trigger to your shame.

Anything that makes you feel rejected or threatens abandonment or makes you feel like you're being abandoned or you're around friends but you don't feel part of all of a sudden.

Or you're around friends and they're giving all the attention to one of the friends but they're kind of ignoring you.

And you feel outside for that encounter with your friends.

Or you make a promise to go out for coffee with a friend and they keep at the last minute saying, oh I gotta reschedule, sorry I can't make it.

And they back out and back out.

So that's just 28 triggers.

Don't know how many that you checked off.

But my point was to help you realize wow I've got all kinds of things that trigger my shame.

So couple notes around that.

You can see easily that some of those triggers are gonna be a lot more intense than others.

Some are gonna take you from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond.

Some are just gonna mildly annoy you.

But there's a greater degree of intensity depending on the trigger and depending on who it is that triggers you.

So you need to factor that in.

The next thing that is important is the intense triggers, they send you in a negative direction in a nanosecond.

So we often talk about when anger is triggered, you go to 0 to 100 in a nanosecond.

Shame can be the same way.

And so you, can almost find it impossible to catch yourself from going to certain places in your thinking and certain behaviors.

And we're gonna get to those in a minute.

But I want you to understand the pull, the powerful pull that shame can have when it is triggered in an intense way.

So I talked about how often it is triggered.

The next thing I say to clients is this.

Once your shame is triggered, how long can you sit in it before you get into a really dark place?

And for many people, it's not very long.

Some, if they don't get out of that shame within a day or two, it is lights out.

That's how powerful and that's how serious it can be.

So remember this.

Part of why we're doing this is so you become aware that the longer you stay stuck in shame, the darker it takes you in your head.

The darker the place you go in your actions.

And that is a very dangerous thing.

So now let me just run through a couple circumstances that trigger your shame.

So failure, where you know you've failed something, or you're in a situation and for the first time, you look back, you start to understand something, and you look back and you go, I can't believe how selfish I've been in this area all my life.

I can't believe how hurtful I've been in my, in this area for years and years of my life.

I can't believe the number of people I've hurt.

And all of a sudden you just go like, wow, I am a really big screw up.

And you can go to shame.

Forgetting to do something that you promised to do.

Or not being the best at something.

Do you realize that some shame-based people become hyper-competitive?

They hate to lose.

Not just because they're competitive, but because they don't want to lose because that triggers their shame.

And it makes them feel less than.

So losing a contest can actually trigger your shame even if it's a fun contest.

Or a game of cards that's just fun.

Or a game of Monopoly.

Where you want to kill everybody if you're not winning.

So that can be a big thing.

Any public embarrassment.

You slip and fall.

Your zipper's done.

You realize you got half your supper slopped down the front of you.

Your collar's sticking up.

And somebody points it out and you realize, I've been walking around all day like this.

And you just go to shame.

We talked about when it takes longer than a minute to get others to learn a new skill.

Some very practical ones.

You'll get on the scale and you gained a couple pounds.

Some of you go right to shame.

You look in the mirror and you got a new gray hair.

And you go to shame.

You look in the mirror and you got hairs growing out of your ears and nose.

And you go, I hated that about my dad and grandpa and now I'm the same.

And you can go to shame.

Everybody's got the latest technology and you can't afford it.

That can cause shame in some people.

Not being able to do what others can do.

Anytime that you're in stressful situations and you're starting to panic a little bit, you can go to shame because you go, I should know this by now.

I should know how to do this.

And you get down on yourself.

Being with friends who have very well behaved kids and your kid's running around like he's crazy.

You can go to shame and you go home hating yourself that you're a terrible person.

Having to ask anybody for help can trigger your shame.

Because then you're admitting you don't have it all together.

And you're a burden you feel to other people.

Revealing to somebody that you respect that you're struggling or revealing a secret.

Do you want to know what happens when people start to get authentic and open up?

They let out a great big juicy secret for the first time.

And it feels so good.

Nobody judges them.

And then they go home and they start thinking about it.

And they go, I can never go back and face those people again.

I bet you they all went home and it's broadcast all over Facebook now and they're talking about it.

And they've all judged me.

They were nice in the group but I'm sure the next time they see them they'll just avoid me and won't even talk to me.

So that can feel good but it can trigger shame.

So what I want you to understand with that is this.

Growing and changing in healthy ways can actually trigger shame.

And that's important to understand because what's going to happen when you take the steps to begin to heal and grow is you're actually going to trigger shame and that's going to make you want to pull back.

And so you've got to push yourself through that to keep on growing.

Another one, somebody comes over for a visit and they didn't announce that they were coming and your house is a mess, your sink is overflowing with dishes and that triggers your shame.

Or you get a family get together and brother one is a doctor, brother two is an engineer, brother three is a lawyer and what are you, a drug addict?

Wow, this is a great family gathering.

That just triggered your shame.

Or you get with your friends and they're talking about all their kids are going to university and getting these really good jobs and they ask you what your kid's doing.

They're in detox.

And you go, oh my goodness.

So those are triggers.

First time your kid gets in trouble.

You've been working so hard on yourself.

You're trying to help your kids deal with their own trauma and you see growth in them and you think, you know, this is going to work out okay.

And then one night they come, one night, they have police call you and they say you got your son and they were smashed and they were doing all kinds of damage and that triggers your shame.

Or your kids get really angry at you one day and they say I hate you and that triggers your shame.

Or you see how your addiction affected your children.

You start to understand their trauma and how you've messed them up and that can trigger your shame.

So that's quite a few things, eh?

So what happens when your shame gets triggered?

Well, it triggers a whole bunch of other things.

So let me run through them and you can check off the things that happen with you.

So the first thing shame triggers is how we think.

So we can go from thinking in a healthy, very clear, good way.

But once shame gets triggered, our thoughts become obsessive.

So we can go from thinking in a healthy, very clear, good way.

But once shame gets triggered, our thoughts become obsessive.

We spin and spin and we relive that event over and over and over again.

We can't stop thinking about it.

Or when we feel shame, we go back, I gotta hide.

I gotta hide, so let's lie.

Or our thinking goes to telling ourselves lies and that is you're useless, you can't do anything right, nobody's ever gonna want you and it's all distorted.

But our thinking becomes telling ourselves all the lies about ourself.

And then we can use our thoughts to beat ourself up.

We can say you're useless over and over again, you're such a failure, you're never gonna amount to anything and we can play that tape day after day once our shame gets triggered.

Other people, they just shut their brain down.

And they go into offense.

They go into fantasy world.

And it's la la la la la, nothing's happened.

I feel great, total denial.

But they can go there or they can just refuse to think about it and distract themselves with activities.

But what they don't realize is it's still operating below the surface at a subconscious level.

Some in their thinking go to messages of hopelessness.

What's the point of all this work?

They get it.

I might as well just give up.

This is useless.

I'm too stupid.

Let's throw in the towel now and quit.

And you can go there when shame gets triggered and in severe cases you can go to, I am so useless, why don't I kill myself?

So that can all happen.

And you see there, there is not one positive thought.
