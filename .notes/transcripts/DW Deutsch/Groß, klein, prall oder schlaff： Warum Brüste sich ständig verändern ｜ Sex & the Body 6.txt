In the 1960s, two guys thought that it would be a great idea to create silicone implants for female breasts. The two were called Frank Gero and Thomas Cronin, two beauty surgeons from the USA. They wanted to make breasts bigger, rounder, fuller, perfectly symmetrical. In short, they wanted to optimize them. And of course they wanted to sell their implants. So plastic surgeons decided that small breasts were a medical problem. They called it mikromastie, a Greek word, translated as much as small breasts. They were underdeveloped, they said, yes, even unhealthy. And that's why affected women would suffer from a low self-esteem or even depression. The implants were booming in the USA. Thanks to Barbie, idols like Marilyn Monroe and the Playboy. In the first years, the new implants didn't even have to go through medical or safety tests. Thousands of women sued the two surgeons for serious complications. But the thing about this story is much bigger. Because small breasts are not a disease. And we'll show you why. Let's get this right. Breasts are available in all kinds of shapes, sizes and alignments. This is Laia Valls Perez. She's a gynecologist. And all of them are normal. Most of them can produce milk just as well when a baby is born. And they can also feel the urge. Most breasts are not symmetrical. One is often bigger than the other. And that's completely normal. Breasts are more sisters than twins. But back to the start. How do breasts develop? In girls, breasts usually start growing shortly before or together with the first hair. And usually before the first menstruation. At that time, more estrogen is released in the body. So breasts often show the first signs of puberty. Then they develop further, over the years. Actually until the first pregnancy, when the milk droppings and milk gills are fully formed. But one after the other. Breasts usually grow in steps. First, only the tip of the nipple stands a little. Then small hills appear, like nipples. The nipples and the area around it, the larynx, rise, become darker and larger. Now a second hill is growing. The area under the nipple and the larynx. The base of the breast. And it's getting bigger too. After some time, the larynx sinks. The breast becomes rounder and only the nipple is still often out. When we look from above, it looks like this. The nipple or the breast-part in the center. Around it, the larynx. And the normal skin over the rest of the breast. Okay, and what's in there? First of all, fat tissue. The fat tissue determines how big the breasts will be. It is the energy storage of the breast and produces proteins. These are important, for example, for the development of milk gills. So fat is nothing to be fought against here, but it is quite important. Between the fat tissue, the breast is a little built up like the crown blades of a flower. There are about 15 to 20 of these units. And they consist of breast-parts and their milk gills. All centered on the breast. The nipples consist of the breast-parts. They produce milk when a woman breastfeeds. The milk runs through small tubes, the milk gills, which unite into larger channels and end in the breast-part. There are other glands in the breast, the Montgomery glands. They produce an oily liquid, like cream. It keeps your nipples and the skin around it smooth. This is especially important when a woman is breastfeeding. Otherwise, the nipples would dry out quickly and itch. Itchy. So these little balls around the nipples are the exit for the body's own moisture cream. But there are also other balls that are looking for breasts from time to time. Peckle. Yes, these little beasts are everywhere. Peckle appears when one of the breasts is dry. The nipples are also the source of moisture. Peckle appears when one of the breasts is dry. The nipples are also the source of moisture. Peckle appears when one of the breasts is dry. Especially before the period begins. But don't worry, like everywhere else, they disappear after a while, even here. A little warm water can help. And of course, the nipples and the nipple are stuffed with nerve ends and thus extremely sensitive. That's how our breasts let milk flow. Because they feel when a baby sucks. But the nerve ends also make breasts very erogenous. Interestingly, the same hormone, oxytocin, is released during breastfeeding and during sex. So playing with the nipples can increase sexual irritation. And actually, stimulating the nipples activates the same areas in the brain as stimulating the clitoris. Some can even come to orgasms only through nipple stimulation. But the nipple is also a source of energy. And that's why it's so important to have a good breast. Every girl and woman has their own breast style. There's nothing that's wrong, too big, too small, too left, too right. As a gynecologist, I see many breasts every day. And I can tell you, there are no two that look the same. Your nipples can, for example, always be upright. Or flat. And only get up when it's cold. Or when they're irritated. Nipples can also be inverted. So look inwards. Or only one of them points inwards. And the other one stands up. Your nipples and the nipple can be filled. A second hill on the chest. The nipple can also look wiggly when the Montgomery breasts, the cream producers, are more pronounced. Hair can grow on the chest. And the whole body is over-salted with hair follicles. Of course, a few also land on the breasts. What's also interesting is that there can be more than two nipples. They are called accessory mammals or polytellae. And they occur in 1 to 5 percent of people. So it's not even very rare. Sometimes only one additional nipple pops up. Sometimes accompanied by a uterus or other breast tissue. Some seem to be right next to the two main nipples. Others can reach up to the shoulder. In most cases, additional nipples are completely harmless. Just a splint of nature. In one case, an additional nipple had even made a half-world trip. Together with a small wheat field. They were found on the sole of the foot. Why not? The nipple is also a very good way to get rid of the nipples. The nipple is also a good way to get rid of the nipples. The nipple is also a good way to get rid of the nipples. The nipple is also a good way to get rid of the nipples. The nipple is also a good way to get rid of the nipples. The only point when you should pay attention is if you suddenly and unexpected changes are observed on your breasts. If a nipple standing actually outward suddenly pulls in, or if your nipples separate liquid or feel sore without a specific reason. Then you should go to the doctor. Then you should go to the doctor. Then you should go to the doctor. But one step back. Isn't it strange that there is a stain of skin on the chest that is clearly visible? that is clearly visible? that is clearly visible? One reason could be that it is like the center of a flower that attracts bees. It shows the baby the way to food. Because with newborns the vision is not yet fully developed. So they seem to need a kind of guide. So they seem to need a kind of guide. That could also be the reason why the nipple and nipple get darker in pregnancy. And there's more to change. And there's more to change. And there's more to change. During pregnancy the breasts prepare to feed a baby. During pregnancy the breasts prepare to feed a baby. Various hormones play a role. The milk flows are longer and become a network. The number of milk droplets increases and the cells producing milk develop. The number of milk droplets increases and the cells producing milk develop. In short, everything expands in number and size. In short, everything expands in number and size. To be prepared for this, there is hard training for the breasts. Because every month the body prepares itself for a baby. Because every month the body prepares itself for a baby. At the beginning of the cycle the estrogen hormone prevails and the milk flows grow. Progesterone takes over in the second half of the cycle and forms the milk droplets. and forms the milk droplets. That's part of the reason why many women have more sensitive breasts or pain at this time. Some women also feel lumpy because of the growing milk droplets. because of the growing milk droplets. The size and shape of your breasts can also change. At the end of the period, you can start to feel more comfortable. At the end of the period, you can start to feel more comfortable. After menstruation, everything starts again. At some point, when the body no longer has egg cells, it changes again, and so does the breasts. The body enters menopause. Some time before women stop menstruating, the hormone levels already change. The hormone levels already change. Clumps can arise in the breasts. They can be painful or sore. When menopause starts, the estrogen levels drop. When menopause starts, the estrogen levels drop. The milk droplets and gills then are no longer needed and shrink. The fat tissue, on the other hand, often shrinks. This is how breasts change their size and shape again. This is how breasts change their size and shape again. So breasts really change all their life. But besides this very individual, how breasts develop has changed in recent times, also globally. From Denmark to South Korea to Zambia. Studies from all over the world show that in girls and boys puberty begins much earlier than a few years ago. That means breasts start growing on average earlier, three months earlier every decade since the 1970s. The causes for this are not yet quite clear, but it seems that substances from our environment have an influence on the whole. Substances that act like hormones and influence our own hormonal processes. Chemicals like Bisphenol A or BPA? Yes. Organic chlorinated compounds? Yes. And parabens? Yes. They are said to disturb hormones and trigger an earlier puberty. They are found in cosmetics, household plastics or pesticides. Even some fragrances can influence our hormones. For example, lavender oil and tea tree oil are contaminated with a lot of harmful substances. For example, they are suspected of having an estrogen-like effect. And for girls and boys, they are suspected of having their breasts grow earlier. These chemicals and premature puberty seem to be also associated with a higher risk of breast cancer. And breast cancer is one of the most common types of cancer. It is not yet fully clear what exactly causes breast cancer. But one reason could be that estrogen and chemicals are not as effective as they seem to be. They are lipophilic. They love a fatty environment. That is why they gather in breasts. So the breasts are the place they like to gather. So what can we do to protect ourselves from breast cancer? Sure, eat healthy things, drink little alcohol, do sports, don't smoke. These are all signs of constipation. They probably help with any disease. But they also seem to lower the risk of breast cancer. The longer a woman is breastfeeding, the better. Getting the first child early is also supposed to help. These are just a few of the many factors that play a role. And there is no reason to change your life for it. Whether you want to have children early or not, it doesn't matter. It is just a matter of time before you can change your life. And if you want to have children early, you have to have a baby. And if you want to have children early, you have to have a baby. And if you want to have children early, you have to have a baby. And if you want to have children early, you have to have a baby. But you can do this. Conduct a breast cycle of them. As the breasts are constantly changing, I can do this every month. I can do this every month. I can do this every month. I can do this every month. I can do this every month. And check it out. And something else. As far as we know, people are the only species that also play a role in sexual intercourse and mating. Some other private individuals, some other primates were observed how they stimulated their nipples themselves, but apparently only for their own pleasure. One theory is that people are the only animals who can look at each other during sex. Face to face and nipple to nipple. So it could be a purely practical matter. But hey, in the end we can be grateful that mother nature has given us another organ that not only does its work, but also gives us pleasure. Subtitles by the Amara.org community
