Life is kind of a lot of work and if I am being completely honest with you guys some days I just do not really feel up to it.  Getting up, taking a shower, eating, doing all the things, getting dressed, driving to work.  There are days when that just feels like so much and that's really frustrating because then there's other days where I wake up and I am like yes I got this today no problem but some days it just feels like such a burden to do the basic stuff that I have to do to stay operational for lack of a better term.  And that's just the body too.  I mean if you get into what our brains need to stay healthy and functional that's a hundred times more complicated and I probably just triggered every physician who watches this channel and they are now going to unsubscribe.

But as a psychologist brains are a giant fiend in the butt to deal with.  They are just inconsistent, they are unpredictable, they are illogical.  That's the worst part.  The The is logic literally comes from our brains yet our brains are illogical.  Make that make sense to me.  In all seriousness sometimes being alive feels more like burden than a gift and I hate that I feel that way.  Like I say those words out loud and I hate that I say them because I do not want that to be true because I do not actually believe that that is true but I feel that way sometimes and having your thoughts and your feelings on a completely different page of life is a really difficult thing to figure out what to do with.  I thankfully do not feel that way nearly as often as I used to and I think for the most part that is because I have discovered and continue to use a series of strategies that makes existence a lot more tolerable for me.  Now these strategies are specifically designed for people who experience things like depression, anxiety, or other mood or anxiety disorders because those add some layers of complexity to what it takes to take care of ourselves and that's you know so much of what we talked about on this channel on this podcast is essentially how to take care of yourself as a person living with one or more mental illnesses because it is more important but also more difficult to take excellent care of yourself if you have a chronic mental health condition or multiple chronic mental health conditions.  So more important being at heart which means we are probably going to need a special set of strategies a different rule book than what most of humanity has to play by in order to you know kind of make it to the end of the day and make ends meet in order to be single in order to live in a way that we can get up and do it tomorrow the day after and the day after.  Before we get into the three strategies I want to define for you today I want to make sure we are clear what it is I am talking about because this is a little bit different than just like oh I am tired oh I am unmotivated this is like I do not completely care to be alive today like I am indifferent to existence right now.  I will give you a silly example of this well it's not silly it's the subject matter is kind of silly but it's a very serious feeling.  One of the biggest I guess I would say fights that I ever got into with my mom and there were more of them than there should have been sorry mom one of the biggest fights I ever got into with my mom was of all things over a parking brake.  We live they still live they kind of live on a hill and so once multiple children in the home had vehicles a lot of us had to park on the street which means we were parked on the hill with our cars just like pointing downhill right and my mom noticed that I did not set my parking brake and one I think it was breakfast one morning at breakfast she assumed I did not know how which I do not think I did that's not the point she was giving me instructions on how to set the parking brake and I am like 17 or something in the story.  I said something along the lines of like mom I do not care.  She thought I meant like I do not care how to learn the parking brake and so she was trying to explain it to me like she's not a good student.  So you have to get the car into a parking brake and then you have to go to the parking brake and then you have to drive to the parking brake on the same day.  And so she was trying to explain to me, like, if you do not set the parking brake, your car might roll down the hill and like trash and become not operational.  So you should care because bad things will happen to you and your belongings if you do not do this thing.  And she did not understand.  And I do not blame her because this does not make a lot of sense if you never experienced it.  She did not understand what I meant when I said I do not care.  I did not mean I do not care because I do not understand that if I do not do this, I might not have a car.  What I meant was I do not care about anything that happens in my life.  I do not care if I have a car because pretty much the only things that I use my car for are if I go to work and go to school.  I do not care about any of that.  I do not care what happens to me.  I do not care what my future is.  I do not care if this works out or not.  Like, I am not enjoying life and I am not having a good time.  And so the idea of losing something that enables me to do the life things that I do not care to do is really not scary to me.  That's what I meant when I said I do not care.  I just did not want to do anything at that point in my life.  I was.  I was indifferent about whether or not I actually like wanted to live or die, but I did not want to participate in life.  I did not want to participate in society.  I did not want to be a part of the world.  It was okay being alive in theory.  I just did not want to do any of the things that I had to do to make that sustainable long term.  I wanted to just opt out of all the things.  And for a long time, I basically did that.  I did literally the absolute bare minimum level of functioning a person can do.  I did not want to do really anything like some of the diseases and like say,arc?  I still wanted to do whatever I were humanly worthy of.  I started playing sticks everybody was thinking I was growing up well.  I started forcing myself into thinking about the two things that were necessary.  One of them was being myself.  I have been partying, partying, had music I had to ÅŸekilde whether I wanted to get the most out of myself , really do not mind being alive and doing, you know, basic self-care things.  So the first rule that I try to live by is I try not to live only for myself.  This, I think, was the biggest mistake that I was making at that point in my life.  There are many reasons that I do not think we should live only for ourselves.  And let me just, before I get to the reasons, let me acknowledge something with that.  I understand that that might be very frustrating to hear.  I think I remember people telling me things like that when I was in that place in my own life.  And I remember hating it because I remember thinking something along the lines of like, I am miserable.  I do not know how I am supposed to find enjoyment or fulfillment or satisfaction in this life.  No one else seems to know how I am supposed to do these things either.  I feel like it's unlikely that anyone figures it out for me.

But if anyone's going to figure it out, I am going to figure it out.  It out I am probably the most likely candidate I need to focus on myself to figure those things out and so you are telling me I should not do the only thing that I think might get me out of this and and not saying you should not think about yourself I am not saying you should not care about yourself I am not saying you should not live in a way that helps you and in fact I absolutely believe you should do all of those things but you should not do only those things and there are many reasons for that perhaps the biggest one is if you have a cyclical mood disorder no matter what you do how hard you try how disciplined you are you are going to hit times when you do not matter to you that's that's part of depression and that's part of anhedonia is you do not care how good your life is you do not care how much stuff you have you do not care how many people love you because if your ability to emerge is to be able to live in a way that helps you and that's part of the biggest problem is that you do not have the ability to emotionally connect with all of those things outside of yourself and vanish at least temporarily at a moment's notice and you cannot solve this problem by stacking as much of those things as possible those things will help you during a better phase of life when you are feeling relatively good when you are not in the midst of a crippling severe depressive episode they do not think they are great they are wonderful and they give you motivation and they give you joy and they make you want to keep going but what about the times when you cannot what about the time the times when throwing all your time and energy only into yourself basically feels like you are throwing coins into a black hole rather than like a wishing fountain that was a weird metaphor so hope you guys know what I mean sometimes inside we just become this black hole and no matter what you put into it nothing good happens it just disappears it just gets sucked into the void and so if that's where everything you have is going there's many times when that does nothing for you so if that's all you have you are going to need to expand that what should you expand it to that's not really my business to tell you and that's not me being boy that's me not knowing all the details of your life or who you are as a person but you know that could be spirituality that could be career that could be a partner that could be children that could be volunteer opportunities it could be pets it could be the environment it could be politics it could be creativity I mean the options are basically endless here and this is just these are super broad ideas that are just scratching the surface right but if it's all just staying inside there's going to be times when you feel completely hollow and empty if you are also investing in things outside of yourself living for more than just you you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes you may still not connect with those purposes emotionally during severe depressive episodes but you will at least logically be able to say I know that like I am making some wise choices here I know that some of my resources are being allocated towards something that does matter for some reason I do not know why this is I would love for someone to explain this to me maybe you guys know if you have any theories let me know in the comments some reason it seems like our ability to care about and for ourselves is hit much more severely by depression than our ability to care for other things or people I do not know if there's a scientific reason for that but like I can have periods of time where I just do not care one single bit about myself but I have never been so depressed that I did not care about my kids for example I do not know why that is and I did not realize that question was going to enter my mind before I started filming this episode so yes if you guys have any thoughts on that let's make this a little conversation in the comments let me know what you think super curious about that one but again bullet point summary number one find something ideally multiple things because if you if it's just one thing depending on what it is there might be periods of time where it's not available to you but but try to have something in this world that matters to you other than just you because when you have a chronic mental health condition you are unpredictable again I do not mean that judgmentally I just mean your inner emotional world is one of turmoil it's one's of all it's one of a lot of ups and downs and it's one that you cannot always count on so if you have things outside of yourself that you can count on you know to be more stable or more predictable than your feelings that can be like an inference storm so to speak you know something that keeps you grounded keeps you on the right track when you are all over the place and I know that I have needed that and I suspect most people who have felt how I felt probably also need that second rule I try to live by that helps me get through these patches when I just do not really care is I have trained myself to operate for an extended period of time in the absence of an emotional reward that that is really what's at the core of all three of these is during these periods of time when we get that black hole void empty feeling we have to figure out ways to continue to live and continue to do things when we are not feeling what we would normally feel under those circumstances we are mammals there's no getting out of that fact mammals are reward based creatures we really only do things for one of two reasons to move towards a desired outcome or to move away from an undesired outcome that those two principles basically explain all of human behavior that's if you look at your day and what you spend time and energy on almost everything is for one of those two reasons and those reasons get very disrupted when the reward part kind of goes bye-bye for a while but it does not have to because if you have learned that this is just a thing that happens to me sometimes sometimes I just do not feel what I know I should be able to feel from the things that I have from the things that I am doing from the fill in the blank with whatever matters to you in life it will not disappear forever if we are talking about anhedonia which is what I am referring to in this episode if you are experiencing anhedonia from a depressive episode it does not last forever so when you have those empty periods try not to panic try not to flip your entire life upside down try not to stop doing the things that you logically know are beneficial for you to continue doing just because you no longer connect with them emotionally because it will come back these are episodes that occur as a component of an episodic mood disorder and by definition every episode will lift at some point that does not mean you will feel amazing it does not mean all your problems will be solved it means you will feel better at some point in the future it's essentially I am talking about delayed gratification here because if we cannot feel an immediate reward we can predict and trust hard word I know like trust is tricky when when you are unpredictable internally but if you can trust okay do not feel this right now but I believe that if I keep doing these things I will get there this feeling will come to me eventually as long as I do not stop as long as I do not stop taking care of myself as long as I do not stop doing the things that I believe are important as long as I do not stop using my tools using my coping skills as long as I do not stop you know spending time with my loved ones again fill in the blank with whatever your thing is it will come back unless you stop doing it will not that's what gets us into so much trouble I have talked about this in another episode and this is just my phrasing and I am trying to think of a less judgy way to say it it sounds judgy but I I legitimately believe that there are two types of depressive episodes there are medical depressive episodes where your internal brain chemistry and physiology shifts and you feel and function differently because of that shift and then there's what I call false depression I do not mean that you are faking it I mean when a depressive episode hits you especially a severe one you often stop doing all the things that make you not feel depressed because if you do not feel any different when you do them it's hard to operate in the absence of reward but if you stop doing those things eventually that depressive episode ends but if you are no longer doing anything that makes you feel good or gives you a sense of meaning or purpose and you are still living like a severely depressed person even after the episode has ended you will continue to feel like a severely depressed person you will continue to feel like a severely depressed person even after the episode is ending.  The difference is it's now not a reflection of your inner biology and neurology.  It's a reflection of your actual life that you are living because you are living like a depressed person.  And if you live like a depressed person, even if you do not actually experience depression, you will eventually experience depression.  And a lot of the people who tell me like, no, I have eternal depression.  Like it does not lift.  There's no episodes.  It's just always like this.  This might be the reason.  And I say this with all the love, respect, and empathy in the world.  Please know that.  You have got to shift out of that mode of functioning when you are able to, or it will last forever, but it does not have to.  Sometimes it's going on and on and on because you were not doing anything to change how you feel.  And I know that it's easier said than done.

But if you can train yourself to at least maintain that bare minimum level of functioning, and even when you feel absolutely nothing from it, that will decrease the frequency, the duration, probably even the severity of these episodes.  It can flip the ratio upside down.  This can be the thing that makes you go from, I am almost always depressed other than when like the stars align and I have basically a perfect day to the complete opposite.  Almost always okay.  Other than when like everything falls apart all at once.  We all have those days.  I will have those days.  You will have those days.

But if the only times you really get brought down to those depths, are on those days where you just, where it's just all the stuff.  It's like everything, you guys know what I am talking about.  Everything that could have gone wrong today did.  Those days are going to suck.  There's nothing you can do about it.

But if those are the only days you feel that way, that's a night and day difference.  And being able to sustain functioning with delayed gratification is crucial to keeping those ratios around.  The third rule I try to live by, and this might sound very similar to the second one.  Again, they are all on the same, they are all based on the same foundation.  So there's some common DNA with all three of these, but I do believe they are worth separating because they kind of land differently, at least in my brain.  The third is do not function on emotion alone.  There is a DDT, dialectical behavior therapy concept called wise mind.  And it's a Venn diagram.  So a Venn diagram is just the two circles and then they overlap in the middle, right?  So the two independent circles are reason mind and emotion mind.  Person functions on emotional alone.  So the two independent circles are reason mind and emotion mind.  Person functioning on reason mind would use only, you know, logic and statistics and objective data to make their decisions.  That's not necessarily good either.  Person living in emotion mind, but was just based on how things feel in the moment.  Both of those extremes can lead us astray at times.  And a good example is a job.  Like let's say you are picking between two different jobs.  So you have two job offers.  Person, you think reason mind would just be a job.  You just look at like the salary, the benefits, the hours, the commute, and basically turn this into a math equation, which job is superior numerically.  The emotion minded person would go based on, you know, what vibe did I get while I was there?  How did the environment feel?  Did I enjoy talking to the coworkers?  And is not going to look at the numbers at all.  Both of those approaches can end up putting you in a really tough spot.

But wise mind is the area in the middle where they overlap.  The tricky thing with depression and anxiety is our emotions often either like they go to both extremes.  Sometimes our emotions get bigger, stronger, scarier than what most people experience.  Sometimes they are gone.  Like sometimes they are just absent completely.  It's relatively easy not to make decisions based on emotions when you do not have them, or you might think, but in a weird way, the absence of emotion still kind of is emotion.  And I hope this makes sense because it's kind of like metaphysical ish.

But I think it's a really good way to think about it.

But also do not make decisions based on the absence of emotion.  So like extreme example, let's say that you hit a severe depressive episode that includes complete total anhedonia.  Like I do not feel anything good from any stimuli in my life.  And let's say, let's say that you are me, you are a 40 year old married man.  And, and because of the depth and the severity of this depression, it's so bad that you do not even experience the feeling of love for your loved one.  You do not even feel the same love for your partner that you normally do under circumstances when your brain is working correctly.  Do not interpret that.  Do not give that meaning other than at the most basic level.  I am in a depressive episode.  I am experiencing anhedonia and I am unable to feel those connections right now.  Do not interpret that as I have fallen out of love with my wife and I should get divorced and try to find someone I actually love.  Because if those feelings are coming from anhedonia and a depressive episode, they are going to come out of my life.  And I am going to feel like I am in a depressive episode.  And I am going to feel like I am in a depressive episode.  And I am going to feel like I am in a depressive episode.  And you are going to feel really upset with yourself when you try to put those pieces back together.  So if you know that your emotions are being manipulated by a mental illness, do not put them in the driver's seat of your life.  I know that's like the million dollar thing and gosh if we could just do that, our mental illnesses would not really cause us any problems.  I know, I know it's not as simple as snap your fingers, flip the switch in your brain, stop doing it.

But you do have to start with just the basic knowledge that my emotions are not always trustworthy.  Because they do not always correlate with what's actually present in my life.  And therefore, I cannot make them the sole decision makers in my life and in my future.  Because they will lead me horribly astray at times when they lose connection with the outer world.  Not saying become a robot and make everything a spreadsheet.  Because that has downsides.  I have kind of tried that.  The way things look on paper and the way they actually play out, not always the same thing.

But do not let your emotions be the sole reason you do things.  I really do not think anyone should do that, honestly.

But definitely do not do it if you have a mental illness.  Because your emotions can be a little out of touch with your actual life sometimes.  You cannot always trust them.  So these three rules.  Living by them has dramatically reduced the amount of times and the duration of time when it does happen.  That I feel like just being alive is a burden.  It's not worth shouldering.  It's almost non-existent for me now.  And even when it does happen, because I know these rules, it really does not cause any problems in my life.  Other than it's.  I am stealing yet another Dave Ramsey quote.  And I am not even nearly as big of a Dave Ramsey fan as that might suggest.  I just find him to be very quotable.  I forgot the quote now because I said too many things about Dave Ramsey.  He's talking about having money in savings.  I had to look it up.  My brain just did not cooperate there.  And Dave Ramsey says when you have an emergency fund built up crises become inconveniences.  So he's referring to things like dishwasher breaks.  And you have no money in savings.  That's a crisis, right?  If you have money in savings and you can pay for the repair, it's still not a fun thing to go through.

But you are like, well, that's too bad.

But I can deal with it.  That's kind of what these rules help me do with my brain.  When my feelings are chaotic or unpredictable or absent, it's no longer, oh my gosh, my life is falling apart.  Everything's terrible.  What can I do?  How do I fix this?  It's ugh, really?  Right now?  Girl, okay.  Let's just get this over with as quickly as possible.  I am ready to move on from this.  Let's get this done.  And I will probably make a good video.  I will probably make a good video too out of it because I will remember what this feels like.  And I will talk to people about it.  And I will work through my feelings with my audience.  So thank you guys for listening.  And I will see you next time.  I hope this helps.  Take care.
