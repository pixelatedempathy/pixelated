So I often get emails or comments on my videos from viewers who are frustrated that they cannot remember any of their childhood or parts of their childhood and not remembering is super frustrating.  There's a deep sense of stuckness for them that is like if you have ever had to sit down and write a story but you do not have a frame of reference or a place to start and it feels like you cannot figure out where it's going to go since you do not have a beginning.  And I tell people that everybody is different.  I have clients that range from remembering everything in their childhood to missing huge timelines in their childhood or missing some smaller gaps.

But there's something I notice in my work with those who have some memory loss that I would really like to say you guys up front and that what I notice is that survivors of trauma assume that uncovering or finding a lost database of memories is the only way to healing and until they uncover those things like they are up the creek that is so not true.  I tell clients that actually you do not need extensive memories to figure out or work on childhood trauma.  I also notice that clients with memory issues assume they do not have any real knowledge or awareness about how bad their childhood potentially was when that's not really true either.  You know more than you think and you might be second guessing your awareness of your own family system.  Having awareness of the family system you grew up in is different than unearthing childhood memories but it's just as helpful if not more helpful.  And the memory loss is a very important part of the process.  It's a very important part of the process.  The memory issue is not like seeing the forest through the trees.  Survivors are often overly focused on the missing details of their childhood and not taking a step back and looking at the whole system that they grew up in.  And I am going to come back to that later in the video.  So I have had clients who report they cannot remember much but they can identify present issues in the family such as having a super difficult or abusive parent in the present or having siblings who are not doing well emotionally or with intimate intimacy in the present or family is super enmeshed or estranged in the present or their parents have like a loveless or conflict oriented marriage or worse a conflict avoidant kind of marriage and they have problems of repression in the present or simply a parent who does not engage or refuses to be involved in the family in the present.  So some clients can report all that going on in their family system but they struggle with identifying tangible trauma from their childhood.  And in my experience if those issues that I just mentioned are prevalent in a client's present then they probably were there in childhood as well unless the family members went through some heavy-duty therapy or the whole family went through some heavy-duty therapy and that is super rare if they did.  So all of those present issues are all a client really needs to know to conclude that they probably grew up in some form of childhood trauma.  And I tell clients like, those present issues are good enough data to work backwards towards childhood to figure out things rather than recall childhood fully.  In addition to focusing on the present family system, when clients start working with me I tell them that their childhood will become more real to them which happens by talking about the family system in therapy sessions, working backwards by starting with what they do know like I just mentioned, working with their triggers and their body memories can help figure out that system even more so.  Working with our inner child who often has more access to childhood situations and emotions than our adult self does.  And all of that does not mean achieving something like full total recall but these help with not being so dissociated from our story because we never bounced it off somebody or dived deeply into it.  And regarding memory issues, clients can have a array of reactions to the therapy that I do such as some might become more aware of the abusive family but they do not recall the huge missing chunks of their childhood and that's actually okay.  Some do have intense flashbacks or situations that are new knowledge to them but that kind of tends to be rare but it does happen in sessions.  For some, the more they talk about and they process with me the more content comes up as we go along because they are no longer dissociated from their own story.  I have had clients in year three of working with me talk about situations they have never brought up before and it's not like a huge revelation to them.  They often thought that they did bring it up with me which makes me wonder or if it's a sign that they were dissociated from their own story.  And some shift out of a vague awareness that the family was really off into having some real mastery over the mess that they grew up in from working backwards with me and starting from what they do know.  So in this video the goal is to not implant memories or some sort of emotional or emotional ecological hump on either up and whatever modeled you.  Childhood but cannot figure out your mental health problems, this video might not be that helpful for you.  As a side note, I find that unless the person grew up in say something like adoption or foster care or extreme abandonment, most clients are more aware of their family system than they think they are.  And even if someone did grow up in all that extreme attachment trauma, I do not think that they need to know the memories in order to work on that trauma.  We already know it was bad just from the attachment viewpoint.  So if you are new to me or new to the channel, welcome.  If you like this video, feel free to hit some of the buttons on the screen.

Inner child exercise called dialoguing you can also get in touch with me through my website and you can connect with me at my Instagram or my tick tock and I will have all the links in the description of this video so as a reminder as trauma survivors we struggle with knowing what's healthy and what's not and we often second-guess our experiences and our intuition childhood trauma is really trauma to our perception like we do not trust what we already know about our families because we do not have a frame of reference and clients need a lot of help with that it's almost like a survivors we start the healing journey is it to say like it was my family was my experiences my life but what do I know about it this is helped by exploring what a healthy family system is like and getting some psychoeducation and some validation about toxic family systems which I try to do a lot in my videos so clients also tend to think if they cannot fully recall a chain of events then they do not have a case for how bad it was or what their parents were like or worse that they are not going to be believed that kind of stuff breaks my heart and as a side note it's important to think if you are a therapist watching this to be at least aware that if clients do not remember their childhood it does not mean that their childhood trauma is irrelevant it's important to think where might they have picked up their survival strategies like fawning freezing fighting coping where did their problems of intimacy come from and where did they learn to deal with their feelings the way that they do it's important to not rule out trauma because they cannot remember childhood fully but they can list family having significant present issues especially if the client feels questionable stuff coming up with the family so let's explore this idea about what clients already know by actually looking at a family system through something called the genogram a genogram is a family tree of dysfunction I have all my clients put one together with me at the beginning of treatment to get a sense about what their system was like past and present here is a hypothetical genogram that I put together and I thought about different clients I have had throughout the years that struggle with not remembering but they are able to somewhat talk about the system in a good enough way when we start working together so here is a family map squares or males circles or females if a family member identifies as LGBTQ plus we can use a triangle or some kind of symbol that feels right to you we are looking at three generations from grandparents down to grandchildren the family up on the top left we are looking at three generations from grandparents down to grandchildren the family up on the top left in dark pink had a girl and a boy and the boy became the father of say the client in bold white who I have not quote like tried to be a good kid let's call him Ben and he struggles with not feeling like he belongs anywhere the mother of that boy came from a nuclear family of five in light pink and they had three girls and the family was was just a highly academic motivated family that's all Ben might know of his mother's side of the family there are really no big bells and whistles in this family system like the client in bold does not report any domestic violence or chaos or poverty or extreme mental illness in the parents or the siblings as a side note clients who struggle with memory can come from either extremely blatantly abusive family systems or they can come from the quiet tricky family systems Ben's Ben's family is what I would call a tricky family so far so in this hypothetical Ben reports the mother suffered from an eating disorder and she had the whole family put on diets or extreme monitoring of calories through a family journal and the mother was also very distrusting of her two children's behavior in the present Ben reports his mother calls him to say to just to make sure that he's doing right by his employer just cuz it would feel to me that the mother does not see the client's goodness and I would be taking that in his data Ben's parents in this example either they believed the child has no reason or reason and to say to the can do it was enough but honestly the parents were not close the化 sister acting out was always in trouble specifically with a mom and then reports that he was always trying to be a good kid in context of that.  And while they were just trying to be good kids.  I am probably thinking about how Ben did not have a relationship with his father who never stood in as a parent because he was an alcoholic.  He was absent but there, sort of.  And this is how some clients often start, and it's good enough.  And all they need to look at was how they were parented, but my clients come in thinking they need to have a cache of solid memories to figure this all out.  The client and their sibling grew up in a tricky family with parents who needed their own therapy.  Ben might say in session that he's expecting me to say that he's not traumatized enough to see me, and that's an expression of shame that's kind of tough to hear.  As a childhood trauma therapist getting this info in the first session, I would be wondering the following.  Could the lack of a present protective father and the mother's obsession with food have been overwhelming?  Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are so sad?  Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are so sad?  Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are so sad?  Could that be all part of the reason why Ben's parents are so sad?  Could that be all part of not being fully in his body as a child and being dissociated and contributing to not remembering?  Was the family in some kind of way in this like suspended animation where the parents were almost just like playing house?  Was the siblings acting out was sort of a ringing of an alarm about the home life, that her acting out was appropriate given that home life?  The sister would have most likely ended up as the identified patient in family therapy, which is infuriating in the sense that the family is not the same.  How about, Mr.  Aznavina, how about you?  How about you?  How about you?  What would you do to stop this?  How would you take that?  How about you?  Life-less or painfully long because the family does not know what to do with each other and everyone is just kind of in a quiet desperation.  What might that be like for a child?  And again, this stuff is usually not new.  If I ask what a holiday meal is like in the present, Ben might report that the father occasionally leaves the gathering to go drink in the basement and the mother is predictably super preoccupied with discussing or controlling the food.  I sometimes think a family like this for a child is like living in a vacuum where you are in a system but you are abandoned in that system because the parents are not emotionally home.  That's what I would be thinking in an intake and I would tell Ben that they have enough awareness and do not need the missing keys of memories to know what's up with this family system.  Lastly, the trauma here in Ben's family is that they do not have enough awareness to know what's up with this family system.

And so, I would say that's what I would be thinking in an intake and I would tell Ben that they Ben's case is about lack of connection and potentially overwhelm as a child due to the parent's stuff to the point of being oppressive and lifeless.  Was the mother like an energy vampire about food and the father abandoning him and all that?  Ben might describe the family system where I might think it's tricky, but as I would get to know him more, there is often a much bigger picture of the parental sort of mental illness.  Alcoholism and eating disorders with severe distrust can lead to some significant pathology.  I mean in the parents.  I have had clients be able to report what their family system is like, but they expressed doubt about how bad the family system was due to the lack of memories say before the seventh grade like in Ben's case.  Let's do another one.  Let's say this client's name is Ann who is in her 30s and she is in the bottom with the bandages and in the circle there.  You know, Ann struggles with intimacy, depression, and anxiety and boundaries.  Like, like not putting up boundaries and can report these details about her family in her intake.  Like a lot of clients who come in, they know that the family is off, but they again might really second guess themselves because they do not remember huge gaps of it.  Let's say Ann does not remember anything from the divorce of her parents from the age of three till about junior year in high school.  She also has trouble remembering several moves in what weekend visits with her father were like during the divorce.  What she can recall in the press.  Present is the lasting question of the father being bipolar due to highly erratic mood swings that lasted days and even as long as a week.  She vaguely remembers early violence between her mother and her father.  She remembers two additional stepmothers, one being someone she really loved, but she could not.

But that person could not manage her father and was out of her life in just about two years.  Let's say Ann also talks about a brother who cannot control his rage whenever Ann and her husband have a fight.  She does recall that the brother getting very violent in her late late high school years and the brother needed to repeat the eighth grade twice due to aggressive behavior in her present life and tends to try to take care of the brother who gets himself into trouble.  And she also takes care of her mother who never remarried and is depressed and and feels immense guilt when she does not call her mother weekly.

But she absolutely dreads those calls.  She feels immense guilt and guilt.  And anxiety about taking care of the brother who she describes as a time bomb when he visits and knows that something is up to come in for some trauma work.

But she does not trust her memory.  And for most of her childhood, she does say in passing that recently the mother told her that in the early stages of the divorce, she left her and her brother with her father for, say, six months.  And that was when Ann was three.  I would be thinking that the father's moods or untreated mental health problems are terrifying.  The responds that a mother is unkempt about her son's world is terrifying.  So the online times are trying to found the biggest examples and And trying to find the missing families mentions.  Given a difference in January or two years ago for kids.  She may even apologize in that session for not knowing more.  So in those two examples, which are really like clients that I have had throughout the years, and you might relate to, you can see that the focus on missing memories is not really all that important.  The two clients that we have discussed, they have enough to know that in their childhood, they did not see healthy intimacy.  They were not safe as children, just in different ways.  They did not form lasting memories either because they did not have healthy adults to share those moments with, or the stress of that childhood caused them to dissociate from the present and think of getting through childhood as opposed to taking it in.  When working with their inner child, I would have them do left-hand and right-hand dialoguing in a session to get a deeper sense of what it was like for them to be a kid in that house.  With Ben, I would have him ask his inner child, How did you feel about Dad?  What was it like with Mom and food?  What kind of kid did you feel?  What did you feel like you were?  Notice how the questions are open-ended questions.  Often the inner child will respond with memories or situations that the adult has been removed from for the years, and that is a very powerful experience.  Some clients get it back by simply talking about it over time, about what they know.  I had a client in their 50s who started working with me, and they were not really able to tell me much about their childhood, but they were able to kind of tell me, like, in one of those genograms.  And over the three years that I was working with them, more and more memories, and more details and situations came up for them as we went along.  And there was a process in the work that I do where I tell clients that childhood will become more and more real to them as we continue the work.  By the third year, they would come up with situations and scenarios about their abuse that I had never heard from them before.  And also, when we talk about the family systems and compare what their family system was like compared to healthy family systems, that also helps us process and get a greater view of the forest through the trees.  In addition, your triggers will help you know what your story is as well.  Let's say Ben comes into a later session having really been angry and triggered because their partner accuses of something that he did not do.  Let's say Ann comes in and tells me every time her partner goes on a camping weekend with the guys, she gets massively depressed and shuts down.  Let's say Ben comes in and notices that when he cooks a meal for his partner, he never gauges the portions right, and there's generally, like, never enough time.

And so, we will talk about that in a little bit.

But, the first thing I would say is, I would say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, let's say, and talk about it for seconds and making meals is really stressful for him.  Let's say, and comes in and talks about a toxic male co-worker, but I catch that when she discusses it, she kind of talks about it in an emotionally unaffected way where other clients might have made a beeline for their HR Department.  I am not judging.  I am just kind of noticing the way that they are affect or their triggers are related to their presence, or in other words being shut down.  So in those 4 hypotheticals, you know, Can you relate to them, but can you also correlate what you know of the person's family story to the trigger that they mentioned?  Can you bridge those two things or where they might come from?  Leave a comment if you think that you can.  So I think the best resource is to find a therapist or healing arts person who gets it and can help you process your family system.  That's the first place, but I know that finding someone like that is super hard, much less affording them.  So when I start with clients, I have them do a genogram with me.  I have an e-course that walks you through how to put a genogram together.  In addition, there are three other e-courses on my website that are helpful in processing childhood or the family system, including a talk I did on shame that includes a worksheet on how to do the inner child dialoguing.  You could also do some journal writing about what your family system is like in the present to begin with and think working backwards about the system on the whole.  Here are some questions to reflect on, all based on the present.  And again, families without significant therapy work do not really tend to change over the years.  So here are the journaling prompts.  How does my family respond when I question abuse or problems?  How did my parents do with their partnerships and intimacy in life?  Does my parent or parents really see me for who I am?  How and why to that?  Do they show up for me in ways that I need?  Who shows up for who more?  The how and why to that.  Like, write about it.  Does it feel like I am an alien in my own family system?  How and why?  How does my family system manage present conflict?  Is it mature?  Is it healthy?  How does my family talk about my childhood?  Are they defensive or do they not remember themselves?  Or do they assume normalcy because basic needs were met, like the food, education, shelter stuff?  Does your family say stuff like you were fine or you were always the problem or I wish I would never met your mom?  Or what do you want?  I had to work.  What do you want?  I needed grandma's help.  That's the kind of stuff you might be looking for in this journaling writing about that last question.  The memory issue is a big issue, but when clients get to me, I know we will be able to process in a good enough way to get a good enough picture of what it was like for them.  And I think you too can process and get a good enough picture as well.  We just kind of have to let go of the, we are kind of attached to this idea that we need these memories, which again, is a very important part of our lives.  And I think that's what we need to do.  And I think that's what we need to do.  And I think that's what we need to do.  And I think that's what we need to do.  We are not totally stuck if we cannot remember the situation We are not totally stuck if we cannot remember the situation or the details.  Check out the description to this video for more additional notes that were kind of too much to include on the issues of memory.  It will be the description of this video.  And I hope that this video was helpful to you guys, and as always, may you be filled with loving kindness, may you be well, may you be peaceful and at ease, may you be joyous.  And I will see you guys next time.  Take care.  Thank you.
