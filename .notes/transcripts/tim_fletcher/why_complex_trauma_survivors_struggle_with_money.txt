money in general for people no matter how healthy they are is a challenge money is this thing that's just a necessary part of life you can't live without it but it is very tricky to manage it might seem like it's kind of an insignificant thing but you begin to realize that it is connected to just about everything we do and we can go wrong with money in a thousand different directions and the number one or number one cause of conflict the studies say in marriages today is money so it causes all kinds of issues so money is very easy to misuse and it's also very easy to develop the wrong attitude toward no matter who you are what i have learned over the years is if i want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on so money reveals a lot about you and what's important to you so that's just in general so money is a challenge for everybody but it's an even greater challenge for people in recovery and i got quite a long list and some of you will relate to every single one of the points that i'm going to make but the first major issue around money in recovery is that money can be a true trigger to use and what i have seen over years in working with people in recovery is that for some people that very first payday once they're in recovery also becomes relapse day because they get that first paycheck and their brain goes to boy let's party the second thing that can happen with people is just even having money in your pocket is a trigger i know some addicts who when they get their paycheck they spend it all just to get rid of the money so they're not going to be tempted they don't have any money left for groceries but they spend it all and the temptation is gone and so money can be a huge trigger especially when you begin to look at meth being sold for less money and and so even having a little bit of money can be a problem but not just having money can be a trigger not having money can also be a trigger for some people and so if you don't have money it can be a trigger to start your boosting career up again and getting some money or do a few bit of dealing deal some drugs get some quick money or turn a couple tricks and get some fast money and so not having money can be a trigger and then for some people having a credit card or a debit card is just too big of a trigger it is something that they cannot handle so if you're in recovery you probably relate to some degree to that and then on top of that is gambling addiction shopping addiction and all of that is money related now let's say you get in a relationship then you have money becomes this cause or source of conflict but also stress i don't know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who don't have debts they don't have a huge saving account that's all been gone they got a lot of debt and debt adds a lot of stress to life then for many people coming in out of complex trauma your brain is still in a state of constant gratification and so part of what you've done in your life is just make lots of impulsive decisions so you buy stuff before you've thought about it just because you feel like buying it in that second of time and so impulsive decisions can mean coming home with a new tv and laptop but then the stress that comes up after that and the conflict that comes after that is great and then some people get in a relationship and they spend a whole bunch of money and they come home and they didn't ask the other person if it was okay to go and spend 500 they just did it and now they've got a huge conflict i have found that the majority of people in recovery would brand themselves as poor money managers there's some that manage money well but those who are not are not going to be able to manage their money and so they tend to waste money and then struggle to pay bills all of that adds stress and creates conflict some who come out of complex trauma have hoarding issues and i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a real problem for people who are in a complex trauma situation and so i'm going to talk about that a little bit later but that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a source of great conflict not just with a partner but with family and friends as well and then many people that come out of complex trauma even poverty and addiction can have a very distorted view of success and they can come into recovery thinking that if i just get enough money to buy what i want then i'll be happy so their definition of happiness and success is tied into getting lots of money and they set themselves up for disappointment i also have encountered many clients who grow up in a family where parents have defined success by the possessions you own the house you live in and so the child still gets pressure from the parent to have certain things to prove that they're successful and the parent wants the child to have it because that child is an embarrassment to the parent if they don't have it so they get lots of pressure and our culture gives us the same message i have also found that many clients coming out of complex prom trauma and poverty often look at people with lots of money and because they wear a smile in public they think those are happy people and then they're envious of them and they walk around saying if i just had what they had then i would be happy and i often say do you know anything about their private life because just because they wear a smile doesn't mean they're happy but that is what can easily happen and so one of the things that's really important to understand up front is this money is a big part of what is necessary to help my children that's what is needed and so what is very easy to think is that more money is the solution to my problems i hope you know that that's a lie that just having external things does not make me a happy person that happens from a healthy internal life not from more things okay now it's really hard for people in addiction to manage money when they come in and then they go out of their house and have to work again into recovery.

But let me take it to the third level.

And that's the challenges for people with complex trauma.

If you come from complex trauma, life for most people in complex trauma is unstable.

You're not sure what mood dad's going to be in today.

So that is iffy all the time you walk on eggshells.

Some of you don't know if you're going to have food to eat on any given day because mom and dad spend it all on drugs and alcohol.

So there's lots of fighting that makes life unstable.

Parents aren't consistent.

They're not a rock.

And so your life is marked by instability.

And that is what creates some of the trauma.

Because you feel like a little child all alone facing all of this instability and you don't feel strong enough to handle it.

So you're traumatized by it.

What is easy for people to do as they get older is think that if I have lots of money in the bank, then that will be what gives me stability.

That is a lie.

But it is really easy to think that because if you got lots of money in the bank, then you think I can handle anything that comes up that might make my life unstable.

But again, it's looking for stability.

In external only.

And that will let you down.

And so many people begin to think, especially in our culture, that if I want a safe and stable and secure future, I need to squirrel all my money away so that I'm prepared.

Now it's wise to be prepared financially for the future if you can.

But that shouldn't be the main source of your success.

So we might be able to falls out, discuss our personal life choices.

So you to what we're able to do.

The one that is of the least importance could be staying wasn't gonna be transportation or a job.

But being like this and you moving around to America, going to New York, moving around and staying the ultra, Crossroad, that way is a must.

you find yourself looking to money to fill that security need it will disappoint you second one and this is probably the biggest one is to see money and shame money and my sense of value so what happens in complex trauma is you end up with this thing called shame so you feel the reason i was neglected and abandoned and abused is i'm bad something's wrong with me i'm not good enough and so you develop a core belief that says i'm not good enough i'm not valuable so what can then happen is a whole bunch of things that will intersect with money so first one some of you with lots of shame just the fact that you're poor today feeds your shame and triggers your shame and seems to prove to you that you're not good enough because you're still poor so be aware of that one some of you are on eia and you have to be on eia but your family is embarrassed that you're not working for a living and so that can become a source of shame if you're on eia and some of you might be a little bit more embarrassed than want to get a job but you can't because of mental health limitations because you need to work on getting a solid recovery in place but your family keeps saying why aren't you working yet you should be a responsible parent and you're not and they feed your shame so be aware of those things i have had many clients say i gotta quit recovery quit treatment and go back to work because i gotta prove that i'm the real one provider for my family and I say I don't see this turning out well but they feel that pressure and it's shame driven okay next thing if you grew up with lots of shame and you figured everybody looked down on you and nobody respected you because after all they didn't respect you at home boy if you had money people all of a sudden respected you and so now you're thinking money is what gains me respect secondly if you grew up with lots of shame then you didn't feel like you fit in anywhere you never belonged you felt all alone in a crowd and then as soon as you had lots of money man you had friends coming out of your ears everybody wanted to be your friend you all of a sudden fit in and you go wow there's a lot of people out there for you if you grow from it's what you'd like and if good natured worth of everything right in-your- aktivist placesciğim that means right now money is how you put your head down and as mentioned in the seashore connect I have to wear a mask because if people get to know the real me, they will reject me like everybody else has.

And so money enables you to establish an image that people like and people respect.

And so again, it seems to make or become the solution to your problems.

And the final shame one, shame makes me feel inferior.

But if I have lots of money, I feel superior to everybody else.

So for people coming from complex trauma, my point is, it creates, because of shame, all kinds of ways to have the wrong relationship with money and to believe lies about money.

And that's what I want you to be aware of.

Okay, third thing that happens with complex trauma, you feel this constant emotion.

Emotional emptiness and pain.

And guess what money lets you do?

Buy medication.

You can buy drugs, alcohol, and activities and have endless distractions that take you out of the pain and give you some pleasure.

And so again, people can think money is the solution to my pain and money is solution to my emptiness.

And then whenever you're discontent, money buys you stuff to do.

Money gives you that high for a little while and it seems to fill the emptiness inside of you.

Now be aware of another part of complex trauma, and that is you create a complex trauma in your kids, most likely.

And what happens with that is you carry this guilt.

And what can happen if you are so discontent with that that you feel like you're going to have to pay back.

You know, you're going to have to pay back.

You're going to have to pay back.

You're going to have to pay back.

You're going to have to pay back.

You're going to have to pay back.

You're going to have to pay back.

You're struggling to pay the bills.

You feel extra guilty that you can't get your kids lots of gifts.

And so I have seen many people go into debt further because their guilt at not giving their kids all the nice things of our culture has driven them to a very bad decision.

And then that can add a whole bunch of stress later.

So, do you see that all of those things that have developed there coming out of complex trauma is distorted perspectives on money and those distorted perspectives on money can result in having the wrong attitude toward money and that's what I want you to think about right now so understand up front money is not a bad thing money is neutral I hear clients say sometimes money is the root of all evil and I say you haven't read your Bible if that's what you think the Bible says the love of money is the root of evil not anything wrong with money it's my attitude toward money that's the issue and so that's what I want you to understand is And so that's what I want you to understand is it's really easy to have the wrong attitude toward money especially in the culture we live in especially because the complex trauma distortions and so what happens though is if I develop the wrong attitude toward money money becomes like a drug it seems to solve my problems but it only makes it worse
