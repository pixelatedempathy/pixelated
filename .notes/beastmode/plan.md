# Implementation Plan & Todo List

## Multi-Layered Todo List

- [ ] ⚖️ Define guiding principles for the simulator
- [ ] 🧠 Reflect on requirements and constraints
- [ ] 🌐 Gather additional context for therapist training simulators and role-play AI
- [ ] 🔍 Decompose simulator into core modules (frontend, backend, AI, evaluation, hosting)
- [ ] 🎯 Formulate primary strategy for MVP and full release
- [ ] 🛡️ Assess risks (technical, ethical, security)
- [ ] 🔄 Plan for LLM placeholder and future upgrades
- [ ] ✅ Define success criteria for MVP and full release
- [ ] 🔨 Design frontend architecture (UI/UX for therapist training, React/Astro)
- [ ] 🔨 Design backend architecture (API, service structure, database, SSE)
- [ ] 🔨 Integrate AI agent (start with mock/placeholder, plan for LLM upgrade)
- [ ] 🔨 Implement evaluation and bias detection modules
- [ ] 🔨 Decide on hosting and deployment (VPS, cloud, Docker, etc.)
- [ ] 🧪 Define and implement test cases for edge scenarios
- [ ] 🎭 Adversarially test for bias, security, and edge cases
- [ ] 🔍 Simulate difficult client scenarios
- [ ] 📈 Validate performance and scalability
- [ ] 🌟 Document learnings and patterns for future optimization
