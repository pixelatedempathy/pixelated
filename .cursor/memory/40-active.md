## Active Sprint / Current Work

### Primary Focus Areas

1. **Patient-Psi Integration (95% complete)**
   - Cognitive Model Enhancement completed with belief adjustment system
   - Coping strategy framework integration complete
   - All core components implemented and integrated
   - Next steps: Final testing and optimization

2. **Real-time Intervention System (33% complete)**
   - Foundation in place
   - Session history integration complete
   - Client state adaptation complete
   - Next steps: Implement Contextual Enhancement component

3. **Documentation Automation (67% complete)**
   - Treatment Planning component backend complete (Supabase integration)
   - Goal tracking integration complete
   - Next steps: Treatment Planning UI component development

### Recent Changes

**Latest Completed (December 2025):**
- Comprehensive anonymization pipeline implementation
- Treatment outcome forecasting API and UI
- Comparative progress analysis feature
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) suite
- Contextual Assistance Integration Testing

**In Progress:**
- Final testing for Patient-Psi Integration
- Contextual Enhancement component for Real-time Intervention System
- Treatment Planning UI component for Documentation Automation

## Current Priorities

### High Priority

1. **Complete Patient-Psi Integration**
   - Final testing and optimization
   - Performance validation
   - Integration testing

2. **Advance Real-time Intervention System**
   - Implement Contextual Enhancement component
   - Integrate with Evidence Library
   - Advanced real-time intervention features

3. **Finish Documentation Automation**
   - Complete Treatment Planning UI component
   - Integrate with Outcome Prediction System
   - End-to-end testing

### Medium Priority

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - Response latency optimization (target: sub-500ms, current: 850ms)
   - Prediction accuracy improvement (target: >85%, current: 72%)
   - Bias mitigation variance reduction (target: sub-2%, current: 4%)

2. **Containerized Deployment**
   - Extend MentalLLaMA containerization pattern to other AI services
   - Cross-service communication in containerized environment
   - Monitoring and scaling improvements

### Low Priority

1. **Advanced Analytics**
   - Enhanced reporting features
   - Predictive insights
   - Comparative benchmarking improvements

## Open Questions

1. **Performance Targets**
   - How to achieve sub-500ms response latency consistently?
   - What optimizations are needed for prediction accuracy >85%?
   - Best approach for reducing bias mitigation variance to <2%?

2. **Integration Patterns**
   - Optimal approach for Evidence Library integration?
   - Best practices for cross-service communication in containers?
   - How to handle complex nested updates in Supabase (RPC functions)?

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Comprehensive integration testing approach for Patient-Psi?
   - End-to-end testing strategy for Documentation Automation?
   - Performance testing methodology?

## Blockers

### Current Blockers

1. **None Currently Identified**
   - All active work is progressing
   - No critical dependencies blocking progress

### Potential Blockers

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - May require architectural changes
   - Could impact existing functionality
   - Needs careful planning and testing

2. **Supabase RPC Functions**
   - Complex nested updates may require database functions
   - Need to design and implement atomic operations
   - Testing and validation required

## Recent Learnings

### Technical Learnings

1. **Supabase Integration**
   - RLS policies work well for user data isolation
   - RPC functions recommended for complex nested operations
   - Migration strategy important for production deployments

2. **Containerization**
   - MentalLLaMA containerization pattern successful
   - Multi-stage Docker builds improve security
   - Monitoring and scaling patterns established

3. **Testing Patterns**
   - UAT suite provides comprehensive validation
   - Integration testing catches cross-feature issues
   - Performance testing needs continuous attention

### Process Learnings

1. **Feature Completion**
   - Breaking features into smaller components helps progress tracking
   - Backend-first approach enables parallel UI development
   - Integration testing critical before feature completion

2. **Documentation**
   - Keeping status files updated helps maintain context
   - Clear task breakdowns improve estimation
   - Regular progress updates prevent scope creep

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Complete final testing for Patient-Psi Integration
2. Begin Contextual Enhancement component implementation
3. Start Treatment Planning UI component development

### Short-term (This Month)

1. Complete Real-time Intervention System Contextual Enhancement
2. Finish Documentation Automation Treatment Planning UI
3. Begin performance optimization work

### Medium-term (Next Quarter)

1. Achieve performance targets (latency, accuracy, bias variance)
2. Extend containerization to all AI services
3. Advanced analytics features
