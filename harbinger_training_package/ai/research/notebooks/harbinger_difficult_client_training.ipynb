    "# Harbinger-24B QLoRA Fine-tuning — Difficult Client Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook fine-tunes `LatitudeGames/Harbinger-24B` to role-play as challenging therapy clients using the existing dual-persona datasets in `ai/pipelines/dual_persona_training/` and other curated corpora like `ai/datasets/merged_mental_health_dataset.jsonl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses 4-bit loading + LoRA (QLoRA). Outputs are PEFT adapters under `ai/training/checkpoints/`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Features:\n",
    "- **H100 Optimized**: FlashAttention-2, optimized batch sizes, parallel data loading\n",
    "- **Regularization**: Weight decay, dropout, early stopping to prevent overfitting\n",
    "- **Adaptive Curriculum**: Smart phase-based training with automatic epoch adjustment\n",
    "- **HuggingFace Upload**: Automatic upload of model, adapters, and GGUF version\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "Training complete! The notebook includes all features from the Python script:\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Performance Optimizations**: FlashAttention-2, H100-optimized batch sizes, parallel data loading  \n",
    "✅ **Overfitting Prevention**: Weight decay, increased dropout, early stopping  \n",
    "✅ **Adaptive Curriculum**: Smart phase-based training with automatic epoch adjustment  \n",
    "✅ **HuggingFace Integration**: Automatic upload of PEFT adapters and GGUF conversion  \n",
    "✅ **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Wandb integration with detailed phase metrics  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Set environment variables: `WANDB_API_KEY` and `HF_TOKEN`\n",
    "2. Run the cells to start training\n",
    "3. Monitor progress in Weights & Biases\n",
    "4. Check HuggingFace Hub for uploaded model\n",
    "\n",
    "**Expected Performance:**\n",
    "- 2-4x faster training with H100 optimizations\n",
    "- Better generalization with regularization\n",
    "- Automatic curriculum adaptation based on phase performance\n",
    "- Ready-to-use model distribution via HuggingFace Hub\n"
