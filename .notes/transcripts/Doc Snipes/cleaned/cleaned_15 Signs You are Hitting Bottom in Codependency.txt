Hey everybody and welcome to this video on hitting bottom in codependency I am your host Dr Donnelly snipes ceus are available for counselors and social workers at all ceus.  Com slash Cody dash ceus let's start out with talking about what hitting bottom actually means it's a term that we use a lot in addiction but it's one we do not use as much in mental health however to change people need to hit bottom it needs to become more uncomfortable to stay the same than it is to change change is hard even if it seems like the best choice when faced with a choice people choose the option that is the most rewarding or the least painful so let's talk about codependency here people are faced with a choice do I address the codependency and get out of this what I can even see objectively is an unhealthy relationship or do I stay in this relationship that I know that is meeting certain needs right now that I can predict that I feel like I have got some element of control whereas change is a complete unknown so you can see why some people may have difficulty choosing to move towards a different way of interacting people will often not change until it's more painful to stay the same than it is to change think about times when you have tried to change anything you have tried to start exercising you have tried to change a particular behavior it takes energy it takes effort and it's uncomfortable whatever you are trying to do differently is often means taking away something that was in some way rewarding like if you start to try right now my kids have recently moved out and so I have had to take over what they have been doing for chores for the past you know 15 years and I am changing my behavior so when I get home in the evening I am Swiffering the house and I am dusting the end tables and things that changing litter boxes I did not used to do that I used to come home make supper and then kind of collapse at the end of the day and I cannot do that anymore and I kind of miss that sometimes however it is important to me to make that change so what am I giving up I am giving up some of my couch potato time however what am I getting I am getting a house that stays clean to my standards hitting bottom is when the person realizes that the change is the only way to stop the pain in codependency the person who is codependent will look around at their life and they will say this is my vision of a rich and meaningful life and gosh most of the things that are important to me are going to hell in a handbasket right now because of this relationship maybe it's time for a change because the pain is worse than staying the same I do want to mention that most people with codependent behaviors have a history of abandonment trauma that has caused them to develop complex post-traumatic stress and I mentioned that because the symptoms of codependency and CPTSD often significantly overlap and it's important to recognize and address the trauma and not just assume that this is a quote relationship Behavior or a quote addictive Behavior well yes it's a a behavior and it may be an addictive Behavior in a in an addictive relationship but it's serving a function what function is that often to provide a sense of safety and security to somebody who is terrified of a abandonment and rejection codependent behaviors often develop during that traumatic time to help the person try and survive now why did I not say childhood sometimes codependency does not develop in childhood sometimes it's the result of being in a relationship with somebody that starts not healthy and then they develop an addiction and you continue to try to pursue them and quote fix them and get the person back that you initially got together with for people to be willing to recover or change any behavior they must be motivated the more important the behavior to survival the more intense the motivation must be if I am going to get motivated to use my earlier example to Swiffer and dust every evening when I come home that's not super important to survival so it does not take a whole lot of motivation for me to say okay I can get up off the sofa and do this if I am going to change something huge then like you know getting out of a relationship that is clearly serving a function at this point then the motivations off of that obviously going to have to be a lot stronger what does hitting bottom look like well in codependency remember people are obsessively anxious they are hyper vigilant to what's going on they are constantly trying to keep the dysfunctional other from relapsing they are constantly trying to protect these dysfunctional other from the consequences of their own actions they are constantly trying to keep the dysfunctional other from becoming angry becoming distressed or experiencing anything that might cause them to relapse it's exhausting and it takes a crap ton of energy so physically the person with codependency often experiences sleep impairment that underlying hyper vigilance and anxiety and feelings of disempowerment and unsafeness because of the situation often keeps them from getting that good sleep as a result of impaired sleep and high tension and high stress they experience increased pain and illness including exacerbation or even development for some people of autoimmune issues there's low energy not only because of a lack of sleep but because their body is constantly revving for the next shoe to drop and some people develop substance use or addictive behaviors now why did not I say addictions may not rise to the level of being an addiction but they may start heavily using substances or other behaviors in order to try to escape from the pain of the codependent relationship affectively or emotionally the obsessive anxiety turns to major depression or explosive anger when people with codependency start to get to the point where they are hitting bottom they start to become emotionally dysregulated so when they are not raging when they are not furious or frantic they are flat or depressed and just do not have the energy and it's usually one extreme or the other and they start to notice that they feel like their emotions come in tidal waves instead of sprinkles they are often played with regret and resentment they regret the things that they have lost as a result of the relationship they resent the dysfunctional other for putting them in that position they resent other people for for abandoning them when they would not leave the dysfunctional other there's a lot of regret and resentment both of which by the way are anger feelings to go around and as I mentioned there's frequent emotional dysregulation cognitively there's hyper vigilance the person is constantly scanning for any clues that the dysfunctional other may be getting ready to relapse or abandon them so they are hyper vigilant to every non-verbal every verbal clue and they start to engage in mind reading you looked at me sideways therefore you must be thinking this and that means bad things are going to happen so they start second guessing or assuming they know the other person's feelings thoughts and intentions when you are this stressed out when you are this hyper vigilant constantly scanning constantly looking for hints that you know it's going to go bad you cannot concentrate your body is not able to say hey I am in the middle of this flat fight or flee response but let's focus on the Excel spreadsheet right now it ai not going to happen the person hitting bottom all starts to engage in stinking thinking which is another term we use in addiction but generally it's characterized by all or nothing thinking you are either all for me or you are against me and it's either all my fault or it's not my fault at all and personalization a lot of people with addictive behaviors including codependency personalize everything you are angry it must be my fault you relapsed it must be my fault you had a bad day and crashed the car somehow it must be my fault and cognitively I did not know where to stick this one people who are hitting bottom in any addiction often say that they are sick and tired of being sick and tired they are over it they have run out of energy they have run out of motivation they have realized that something needs to change environmentally when the person is hitting bottom remember I said the pain of staying the same has to be worse than the pain of change because change is hard making amends is hard letting go of control is hard but the person who's hit bottom in codependency looks around one day and realizes they have lost pretty much everything the friends that they used to have have kind of washed their hands and been like I cannot be party to this anymore I cannot enable this behavior family has done the same thing a lot of times in codependency whatever the dysfunctional others issue is whether it's mental health issues or addiction issues it costs a lot of money so the money is gone the person with codependency very often has problems at work at the very least or loses their job because they are so obsessed and consumed with enabling the dysfunctional other they call in sick or they do not focus at work or they make mistakes or all of the other emotional and cognitive issues make their productivity and work product just kind of disappear their health has also gone you know they look around remember I said they have increased pain increased illness reduced sleep a lot of times people with codependencies realize that the stress of the relationship is impairing their immune system it's impairing their health is actually literally killing them and often when the person with codependency hits bottom they may have lost the dysfunctional other the dysfunctional other may be so steeped in their problem in their issue that they realize that the person with codependency realizes realizes on some level I cannot bring them back from this and the dysfunctional other may be actually pushing them away going you know what get out of my life I just I cannot deal with having you around anymore relationally the person who's hitting bottom with codependency has low self esteem to begin with but now they are really feeling empty and worthless because with codependency they had a very unstable or weak sense of who they were and a sense of self is what we call it and when they are no longer needed when they are no longer caretaking for the dysfunctional other they do not know what their job is they do not know who they are they do not know what they are supposed to do and that starts to feel really terrifying compulsive caretaking also starts to turn to helpless the person who's hitting bottom starts looking at the dysfunctional other going no matter what I do no matter how much I turn my life upside down and hurt myself you are not changing and they start to develop a lot of resentment towards the dysfunctional other they are not ready to let them go yet but they are starting to get really angry and resentful but they feel helpless to change anything they are terrified to let go but they are also recognizing that they cannot change it in in psychology again I said Martin Seligman devised a term called learned helplessness and when we continue when we do things and no matter what we do there's a painful consequence at a certain point sometimes we just give up and lay down and take it and that's where we are at with people when they are hitting bottom so what does it mean to let go what does it mean to change letting go of these codependent behaviors is terrifying that for many people means letting go of control and if they in the past if they have let go of control bad things have happened letting go of this relationship and letting go of these behaviors that have worked to some extent until now is terrifying so sometimes I will do an activity with the people I work with where we talk about reframing letting go what are you letting go of but then what are you getting control of vulnerability when you are letting go you become very vulnerable when you do not have somebody else that you are trying to control you do not have somebody else that is providing structure on the same end yes you are vulnerable but now you only have to use your energy to control yourself and you can use it to move towards those things that are important letting go of codependent behaviors means accepting that you could not change or fix it or them okay that's terrifying because it often represents the fact that you may not have been been able to change other relationships as well however you also when you do that the flip side is you start to recognize that it was not me it was something that was not changeable but it was not me when you let go of codependent behaviors you grieve the loss of the fantasy you are not going to get the person back that you thought you were in a relationship with or that you hoped you could make out of this Diamond in the rough it ai not going to happen that's terrifying and heartbreaking so there's some grieving that happens when you let go of those codependent behaviors but you also get with it and increased awareness and appreciation of the present moment okay I am not going to get this prince that rides in on a white horse ai not going to happen what do I have in the present moment and when you let go of codependent behaviors it means you have got to learn a whole new skill set feel very overwhelming however what you are doing is gathering tools to help you be the person you want to be and there's no time frame it's not like you have got to learn all these skills in two weeks you have got time to do it if the

go of a dream they are letting go of you know a lot of things control remember in the grief process we have denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance when a person hits bottom the grieving process denial when they are in that place they are still saying it's them and not me i can fix them then they are going to love me and i will feel happy well once they bust out of that denial a lot of people move to anger and we see the person with codependency bounce back and forth between all of these feelings while they are in the relationship it's kind of interesting there is an ongoing grief process so then they move to anger if the dysfunctional other would only do what i tell them things would be okay and i could relax they do not appreciate my sacrifices so they are angry that they cannot control the person and they are angry and feeling unappreciated and they are going to feel like they are not okay and appreciated bargaining all right okay let me step back maybe if i do x y and z then they are then they will change you know let me let me see can i bargain with you if i do these things will you quote behave and the dysfunctional other may say yes may say no but the person with codependency is still trying to figure out how to make it work depression you makes them change it's hopeless I am helpless and that is the place where the person is really hitting that bottom when they are hopeless and helpless they recognize what they have been doing ai not working and it probably never will work so they are having to find something else they are having to let go of this pattern and finally acceptance continuing to do what I have been doing and expecting different results is insanity it's another phrase that we often use in recovery circles my life with this person has become unmanageable and I am powerless to change them that's step one of codependence Anonymous I have to make a change if I want the things in my life that are important and that is the final assertion in acceptance when the person has accepted that they have to let go of this dream this fantasy this this relationship hitting bottom is part of the grieving process when making a significant change one of the things that you can do to raise the bottom which means to organize literature now is the money where is and one of the the Chris platypus ideas that I vividly少ied in your fooled the step I use is to increase activism the true creation of knowledge and understanding as a result will increase you in your life volleyballrencesств to increase awareness of what works and does not connect you withخ can be large concatenating earlyquelic encourage you not to use words but to actually do a collage because if you are talking about harming the relationship with your kid and you have to put a big red X through your kid's face that's kind of startling when you step back and look at it so it can be a wake-up call once people start becoming more aware they are going to become more motivated but a lot of people with codependency if not all are terrified of being alone because they do not know who they are if they are alone they may not have ever been in a place where they have not been taking care of someone so they do not know what to do the loneliness the trauma the depression the anxiety the grief everything they are going through they think oh my gosh if I have to go through this alone it might just completely overwhelm me which is why it's important to join a support group or begin counseling but this is what I call placing an anchor when you are rock climbing or mountain climbing you know as you go up you periodically place anchors so if you start to slip you are not going to fall all the way back to the bottom you are only going to fall a little bit of the way so place an anchor support groups codependents Anonymous adult children of foreign alcoholics there are a lot of different free support groups out there your community also may have other support groups for codependency final thoughts recognize that the recovery from codependency requires that you grieve the loss of the relationship with the dysfunctional other there was something about that relationship that was very important to you you grieve the loss of the hope for a relationship with the imaginary dysfunctional other and I mentioned this earlier the diamond in the rough a lot of people who are codependent get involved with others dysfunctional others who need to be rescued or seem to need to be rescued so the person with codependency sees them as a diamond in the rough I will just polish them up and I will make them into this shiny Diamond that ai not going to happen other people may have been in a relationship with the person when they were healthy and then the person developed an addiction or other problem and they hold on to this dream of having the Jim Bob that they married back and that person may not come back if the current Jim Bob is steeped in addiction or trauma or something else the repeated loss of the original dysfunctional other is another thing to grieve most people who are codependent or have codependent behaviors have some original traumas that every time a relationship breaks up especially a codependent relationship that initial relationship that did not work out which is often with a caregiver is is repeated you know they feel like they are losing dad or mom all over again and it's going to be important to grieve that the original dysfunctional other that started all of this and they need to grieve all of the things that they have lost along the way as a result of these dysfunctional relationships so there's a lot of grieving to go around related videos are linked in the notes to this presentation.
