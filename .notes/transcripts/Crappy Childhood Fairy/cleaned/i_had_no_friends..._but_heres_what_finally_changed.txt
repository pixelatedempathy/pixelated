There's a moment in life that just stops you cold.  And it's not when something bad happens exactly, it's when something bad happens and you realize you are facing it completely alone.  And that moment came for me after years of holding it together.  I would been through a brutal divorce.  When I tried dating again eventually, the guy died.  I would had 14 major surgeries in just all of this was in a few years.  And as everything was falling apart, I looked around for help, for support, for someone to show up with soup or sit with me on the worst day.  And people would show up, sort of, you know, they would come, they would bring something, they would talk for a little bit.

But it's just that these hardships, these surgeries and stuff, they just kept happening.  And after a while people stopped coming.  And then I was alone.  I had no real friends, not the kind who show up, not the kind you can call in a crisis.  They are just, you know, people I knew.  And I had been there for some of them, but it just turned out not to be a reciprocal relationship.  They were people I would seen at work or at events or in passing, but no one, you know, who I could lean on when I needed it the most.  And this hit me like, you know, like like a punch in the chest.  I had built my whole life this way and I had to face that.  You know, I was friendly with everyone, but I was close to no one.  And it was not that I did not want friends.  I wanted them desperately, but something was in the way.  Some invisible membrane.  That's what it felt like.  Something between me and other people.  And I finally had to ask myself the question I would been avoiding for decades, like, why do not I have close friendships?  And why has it always been this way?  And that was the moment everything started to change.  The path was changed and I changed what I believed I was doing to myself.  Not just, like, be confident, but to be able to do my job well, get in support of people and find some help.  And I started with these experiences.  So for example, if you step on an ifra, instead of just the food, the stupid, brutal approach with charged and really dangerous沒有 ВOffе.  Or something you would like to do very quickly, something that would go through a lot.  Need anyone to never expect attention or help or affection from anyone.  So I built a life where I never had to ask, where I never had to need anything, where I could do everything myself.

But here's the thing.  Trauma wounds do not just come from the disappointed feeling that you were neglected, the neglect itself can cause changes to your nervous system.  In childhood development where you do not end up learning to naturally connect like you were supposed to or you cannot connect fully.  And I have learned that it's incredibly common for traumatized people to feel a sense of disconnection from people in every part of their lives, in every kind of relationship.  So I did not know that back then.  I just knew that I felt separate from people.  I could be in a room at a party, even with someone I loved and still feel completely disconnected.  And then after my divorce and the death and all the surgery, when everything fell apart, I saw the full cost of what this life of disconnection was because you can kind of be independent when you physically can take care of yourself.

But when you need people, you need people.  And I did not have anyone who would show up.  And I realized I was not just unlucky with friends.  There had to be something I was doing because it was like a pattern.  I was isolating.

But isolation does not just happen.  It's not a random condition.  It's a set of behaviors and habits and reactions that end up pushing people away or you end up pulling away.  So I started to study myself and what I found shocked me.  I found I thought that I was so good at this, but I found I had nine obstacles.  I counted them.  I wrote them down.  This was a whole journal that I had nine obstacles inside me that had been blocking connection my whole life.  And these are common in people with trauma, and they are sneaky.  You do not always see them right away, but they shape everything.  So here's what they looked like for me.

First, I felt like I did not belong.  I did not feel like I belonged anywhere.  Sometimes I thought I did for like five seconds or a day, and then the feeling would come.  No matter where I was, I had the sense that I was different.  Like there was a secret code everyone else got and that I did not get it.  I found out that's normal.  Number two was I was socially awkward.  I did not know how to be myself in front of other people.  I made a lot of jokes, but not always at the right moment.  I could be alienating with my sense of humor, and it would come off as insensitive.  Sometimes I either said nothing to compensate for this.  I would just be really quiet or I would say too much.  Three is I lacked social attunement, and I just I missed cues.  I did not always pick up on what people needed.  Sometimes I talked over people or I gave advice when all they needed was to be heard.  Then number four, I could not trust my perception.  I was either hyper vigilant and seeing rejection where there was not any, or I was completely blind to red flags.  I did not know how to tell what was really going on with people.  Five was my boundaries were all over the place.  Sometimes I had walls.  Other times I just let people.  You know, all over my life.  Just come treat me bad, do whatever, because I did not want to lose them.  And I was afraid to say anything about what was bothering me.  Number six was I ended up with a lot of mean and troubled people in my life.  I also know that's very common for traumatized people.  And this happened not because I wanted it to happen and definitely not because I thought I deserved it.  I did not think I deserved bad treatment, but because I could not see the red flags.  I just did not know how to tell when someone was unstable or even dangerous until I was already in too deep.  I was attached.  And even when things felt wrong, I would second guess myself.  I assumed if there's a problem, it's got to be me.  And that kind of like red flag blindness, it does not mean you are weak.  It means your early experiences probably distorted your radar.  And when you cannot see trouble when it's staring you in the face, it makes connection feel like walking through a minefield.  Number seven, I did not believe people cared about me.  Some did not, but I would behave as if, well, I either did not open up at all or I overwhelm people by pouring out my whole life story too fast.  Like, I better get it all in.  I got to get all the communication in in like five minutes because I would just feel I just thought people did not care and they were about to get up and leave.

But that's not really connecting, is it?  Number eight was my emotions were dysregulated.  I would either shut down completely or I would explode and I did not know how to be present with people.  And I was like, I am going to be a person when I was at the same time feeling strong emotions, which I was.  When you are going through a hard time, that's what's going on.  So I was like, I was like somebody who was just learning to drive, brakes, gas pedal, brakes, gas pedal.  And nine was I focused too much on other people.  And it was not because I wanted to fix them.  I know that's common, but it was because focusing on them kept the attention off of me, it kept my attention off of me.  Maybe.  And I thought what I was seeing was their potential.  And I just go, oh, they have amazing potential.  And I would almost be angry that they seem to refuse to be the person I believe them to be capable of being when I first met them.

But all of that was a projection.  I think doing this helped me avoid the emptiness in my own life.  And it was hard to face.  I needed a project.  I would have rather had somebody who I was proud to have in my life and could take places, but I did not.  So I would put tremendous effort into it.  I would put tremendous pressure on people.  It's like, come on, act normal.  And meanwhile, I would over listen, I would over share, I would over accommodate.  And then I would wonder why I felt invisible or resentful.  And I thought I was being loving, but really, I was just disappearing.  And the thing about me and many people is I can only disappear for so long.  At a certain point, I will snap and then I will be so angry.  I will just be like, why are you allowing me to disappear?  So that was kind of how I rolled back then.  And when I saw these patterns, I felt a mix of grief and relief.  It was grief because of all the years I would lived without real connection, but relief because finally I had a map.  I had something I could work on, something I could change.  And so that's what I did.  I started taking steps to undo each of those nine obstacles one by one.  And it was not instant.  It took time.  Some things happen quick.  Some things take time.  It was uncomfortable.  Sometimes it was embarrassing, but it worked.  It did work.  Hey, I have got a quick invite for you.  I made a free daily practice course that shows you two simple techniques to calm the storm when you are triggered inside.  It's short, it's powerful, and it helps you feel clearer, more focused, and more at ease.  Fast.  Click the second link in the description section below or use the QR code right there and you can start your course right away.  Here are the shifts that made the difference for me.  And you know what?  I have a whole book.  I wrote a whole book about what I learned from this, how to connect with people.  It's called Connectability.  You can order that right now.  There's a link down in the description section, or you can go to Connectabilitybook.  Com.  So here's what I did.  One was I softened my avoidant behaviors.  I stopped ghosting people.  I stopped disappearing.  And when I got scared, I stayed just a little longer each time, just enough to kind of talk things out.  Number two was I taught my heart that I belong.  Sometimes I just had to tell myself because I did not naturally believe it.  I did not wait to be invited to things.  I would just show up.  I participated.  I invited other people to do things.  They sometimes did not respond, but I just kept going.  I let people see me even when I felt awkward.  It was second nature to me.  I did not automatically know how to do it, but I just kept trying.  And then it got easier.  All right.  Then I let myself be awkward and I kept going.  I gave myself permission to be clunky and weird because I am kind of weird.  And I did not run away when I said something weird.  I just tried to let myself be human.  And I healed my powers of perception, too.  I practice noticing.  I learned to ask questions.  I stopped assuming and started clarifying.  Like, when I did not understand something, I asked a question like, could I just ask a question?  Is this meant to be a date?  Stuff like that.

But I used to just like, sweat it out.  And just feel confused.  I became a better observer.  I strengthened my boundaries.  I started saying no.  When I felt like saying no, it's okay.  I could make a plan with somebody to do something and then change my mind and say, you know what, this is not going to work for me today.  And I did not want to be rude and inconsiderate and just run people through exhausting changes because of my personality.

But just once in a while when it was really true, I just said, no, no, thanks.  I told the truth.  I did not explain or apologize for needing space or to prioritize something else.  And I stopped complaining that people walked all over me.  They cannot when you do not have a boundary problem anymore.  And I learned that only I could change who I hung out with.  I would just complain about the people in my life.  And then I was like, okay, well, who decides who I hang out with?  Me.  So I changed that.  And I let go of mean and troubled people.  I stopped giving my energy to people who drained me or mistreated me or left me hanging or just I ended up feeling anxious all the time around them.  I let those connections go.  And mostly I just did it quietly.  I did not make big speeches or anything.  It did not take a big effort.  The last thing I needed when I was healing was big, dramatic goodbyes or arguments.  So I made space by just letting go.  And the space opened up for people who were kind, who had they were interested in becoming friends with me.  And I began to believe that people do care.  And I listened more.  I stopped trying to prove myself.  I let people in slowly.  And they did not instantly become my best friend or my boyfriend.  And I let them show up for me.  I just would let sort of information come to me about like, yes, who is this person?  How is our dynamic?  I regulated my emotions.  That's a learned skill, by the way.  If you have not learned how to do that, you can do that in a number of my courses, like dysregulation boot camp and healing childhood PTSD.  So you can check those out, too, on my website, crappychildhoodfairy.  Com.  I used I always talk about the daily practice, but that's what I did.  I use the daily practice techniques because when you start to make big changes in your life and set boundaries and people are mad at you and falling away, you need a way to deal with all the feelings that come up.  If you have been living with trauma for a long time, there's a lot of jammed up thoughts and feelings, it's very crowded in there.  And so when something kind of painful is happening, like you made a hard decision and now you feel kind of guilty, you need space to process that and stay real with it and figure out what you need to do about it, if anything.  So with my daily practice at the time I was making these changes, I had actually quit for like two years, I was mad that my marriage fell through.  I was scared that I was left with two little kids and not very much work.  And I did pull it together.  It was okay.  It all worked out just fine.

But it was scary right then.

But I was mad because I guess in my first 12 years of the daily practice, in the back of my mind, I thought it was like a magic trick.  And if I was like good and I did the techniques, I would get everything I wanted.  And I thought I wanted the marriage to last.  It turns out the marriage ending was like one of the best things that ever happened.

But it was a very hard road for a couple of years.  So I did not see that right away.  And gradually I realized how bad things got.  Like when I was not doing my daily practice for two years, the downfall did not happen right away.  It was just this gradual drift.  And it took me a long time to go, wait a second.  This is not a coincidence.  This is not all just like bad luck that I was losing a lot of my ability.  I was losing my red flag detector.  I was losing my self confidence.  I was losing my energy.  I was losing my boundaries.  Just problems were just like escalating in my life.  And it got bad enough that I finally returned to my daily practice.  And it was like, overnight things changed direction again.  And it did not take long for things to start moving back in a better direction.  I do not think it ever, you know, life, you never get exactly back to where you started when you recover from a dip like that.  You go to a new place and it can be even better than it was before.  Because now you have, well, in my case, I have lost that delusion, that illusion that if I was a good girl, I would get everything I wanted.  Life is not like that.  Sometimes what you want is not the thing that's going to work.  And you lose or you get something better.  I do not know.  I do not tend to have magical thinking about that.

But you cannot make everything go your way.  You just cannot.  And I think the game of recovery, the object of the game is that you learn to be like, okay and happy, whatever is going on.  And that's what safety is.  That's what confidence is.  You come to believe in your heart that I do not know what's going to happen.

But whatever it is, I am confident.  I am confident that I will figure something out.  I will know how to deal with it.  And that is freedom.  That's a real freedom.  So I learned to calm my nervous system.  And I did not know that's what the daily practice was doing for me at the time.  I did not learn that until like 2014, that there was a such thing as nervous system dysregulation.  As soon as I read what it is, I was like, that's exactly what I have.  Now people talk about it all the time.  You probably know what it is.  In my early videos, I had to explain it every time.  It's like, well, your nervous system is glitching.  All your body systems are prone to sort of get disrupted.  And it can affect your emotions and your thinking and your hormones.  And you get discombobulated and clumsy, and your emotions can go too big or too small.  So a lot of stuff happens.  So I learned to regulate that.  I did not have a word for it, but my daily practice, it turns out, all along had been this marvelous tool that would help me to re-regulate, not just in my emotions.  Emotions are one piece of the pie.  Neurological dysregulation is a lot of things.  Emotional dysregulation is the one other people can tell.  They can see it.  When we are lashing out, they are like, gosh, this is so unfair.  When our hormones are going a little bit in the wrong direction, you do not even notice it, let alone everybody else.  So most of the stuff that happens from dysregulation is you cannot feel it, but you will feel it downstream with how it affects you.  So when I got back to my daily practice, all I knew was I felt better, and I gave myself time to keep working on it.  I did not jump into new things.  And I really, really practiced putting my attention on that moment when something triggered me and how I reacted.  I practiced.  I do not think I would have called it this at the time, but it was like being present, just like not running away, not shutting down, not panicking, not trying to control the situation, but just kind of like letting it in.  What was going on?  That used to be really uncomfortable for me, which is hard to imagine now.  I no longer had to make every situation feel right or assume something was wrong just because I was uncomfortable.  I just stopped taking crap from people.  I just was able to stand up for myself or walk away from situations.  And that used to feel like rocket science to me.

But with a little practice, it started coming naturally.  And I brought the focus back to myself, like not in a selfish way.  I used to think it was selfish to do that.

But if you are not focusing on yourself, you can go quite numb to what your effect on other people is, what's happening.  So when I am I got more grounded and I was paying more attention and taking care of myself.  One thing that changed is I stopped over functioning.  I did not even know there was a word for that.

But I used to jump in and try to handle a lot of stuff for other people when I did not need to.  And I still have that tendency kind of waiting there.

But you can let other people be responsible for their own lives.  Friendships began to grow and it was slow at first, but then more and more.  And there were people I could laugh with and people I could cry with and people who called me when they were hurting and who picked up the phone when I needed them.  So now I do not have a million close friends.  I do not need that many, but I have a real circle now.  People who love me and who I love back and we show up for each other.  And that's not something I ever thought that I would have.  So if you are in that place right now where life is feeling really hard and you look around and you realize that you have no one, I just want you to know it can change.  You are not broken and you are not cursed.  You ever think that a lot of us do.  I am cursed, but you are not.  And you are not too weird or too damaged or too late to have connections with people.  You kind of just need a map.  You just need to see the patterns and then go, , that's where I keep making a misstep.  That's an obstacle for me.  This is something I can change.  And then you just take one brave step forward.  Just one.  It can be really small.  It could be just like sending a text or smiling at someone or saying yes the next time you get invited to something that you think you might want to do, you can write down your fears and resentments.  Using my daily practice techniques, you can do that just for 90 seconds and then write the little thing where you ask for them to be removed instead of running away.  Hey, it's me.  And real fast, if you are watching my videos and wondering if maybe past trauma is having an effect on your life today, I want to share with you a list of signs that what you are struggling with now might be connected with neglect or abuse in your childhood.  It's good to know this because it can help you know that what's hard for you right now is normal and that healing is possible.  You can download my Signs of Childhood PTSD Quiz by clicking the top link in the description section below or using that QR code right there.  So that's how healing starts.  Friendship is not something that just happens like lightning to lucky people.  It's something that you build and you can build it even if no one ever showed you how.  And I am living proof.  If I can do this, you can do this.  Hey, if you like that video, I have got one I know you are going to love.  It's right here and I will see you over there.  Pushing people away so that you can be alone is incredibly common with people who grew up with childhood trauma.
