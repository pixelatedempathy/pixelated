## Task 3: Implement Segment-to-Training Converter
**Priority: High - Core Conversion Logic**

### 3.1 Build Prompt Generation Engine
- [ ] Create semantic analysis for key concepts
- [ ] Implement template-based question generation
- [ ] Add variation to prevent overfitting
- [ ] Validate prompt-response coherence

### 3.2 Format Conversion Pipeline
- [ ] Transform JSON segments to training format
- [ ] Add expert routing metadata
- [ ] Implement quality filtering
- [ ] Generate training/validation splits

### 3.3 Data Validation System
- [ ] Verify input-output semantic alignment
- [ ] Check for duplicate or near-duplicate pairs
- [ ] Validate therapeutic appropriateness
- [ ] Ensure balanced expert distribution

---

## Task 4: Quality Assurance & Validation
**Priority: Critical - Prevents Training Failures**

### 4.1 Manual Sample Review
- [ ] Review 50 examples per style (200 total)
- [ ] Validate prompt authenticity
- [ ] Check response appropriateness
- [ ] Verify Tim Fletcher voice consistency

### 4.2 Automated Quality Checks
- [ ] Implement semantic similarity scoring
- [ ] Check for harmful or inappropriate content
- [ ] Validate therapeutic accuracy
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting

### 4.3 Expert Distribution Analysis
- [ ] Verify balanced training data per expert
- [ ] Check quality distribution across experts
- [ ] Validate style consistency within experts
- [ ] Ensure adequate training volume per expert

## Task 5: Lightning.ai Integration Preparation
**Priority: High - Training Pipeline Ready**

### 5.1 Format for H100 Training
- [ ] Convert to exact Lightning.ai format
- [ ] Optimize for H100 memory constraints
- [ ] Implement proper tokenization
- [ ] Add training metadata

### 5.2 Training Configuration
- [ ] Set LoRA parameters per expert
- [ ] Configure batch sizes for H100
- [ ] Set learning rates per communication style
- [ ] Prepare validation datasets

### 5.3 Final Validation
- [ ] Test load into Lightning.ai system
- [ ] Verify training pipeline compatibility
- [ ] Validate expert routing logic
- [ ] Confirm therapeutic voice preservation

---

**Critical Success Factors:**
- Each prompt must authentically represent what someone would ask Tim Fletcher
- Responses must maintain therapeutic accuracy and Tim's voice
- Expert routing must be semantically consistent
- Training format must be Lightning.ai H100 compatible
- Quality validation prevents catastrophic training failures

**Next Step:** Begin with Task 1.1 - Audit Current Data Format
