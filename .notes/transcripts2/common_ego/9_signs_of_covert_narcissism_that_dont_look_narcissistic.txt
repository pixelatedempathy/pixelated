our relationship with a narcissist is a lot buying a house with a foundation problem. On the surface, everything looks solid, but the longer you stay, the shakier it becomes. in this video, I'm going to walk you through nine signs of covert narcissism that don't really look narcissistic at all on the surface. you can see the foundation problem for what it is before it all starts to crack beneath you. My name is Christina and I help people make sense of the chaos narcissists leave behind they can stop second guessing themselves and finally move on. And if you're still not sure about what's keeping you stuck, I created a free quiz that can help. It's designed to show you exactly where you are in the recovery process and what to focus on next. You'll find a link for that in the description. let's start with the first sign because it's one that usually flies under the radar. And by the time you recognize it, it's already started to chip away at your sense of reality. They downplay things that hurt you. maybe you bring something up and it's something small, but , it's stuck with you. And instead of owning it or hearing you out, they naturally brush it off. They might say you're being dramatic or that's not what I meant. And sometimes you get the full out gaslighting. That's you're not actually upset. You're just trying to make me feel bad. somehow through all of this, they become the authority on your feelings. I don't know how that works, but somehow for them, it does. But through all of it, it doesn't sound angry. It sounds, it's calm. they're just setting the record straight. And the dangerous part is then you find yourself backpedaling. maybe you're explaining your tone or justifying your reaction. You're trying to prove that, yes, you really were hurt, even if it seems it wasn't a big deal. And this is where the shift starts, because now you're not talking about what they did. Instead, there's a group effort managing how much pain you're allowed to feel. And there you are working overtime to sound reasonable they don't flip it back on you. And in the middle of all of this, you're trying to prove that you're not hurt. And you're trying to you're trying to prove that you're not hurt. And in the middle of all of this, you're trying to you're trying to prove that you're not hurt. And you're trying to it seems easier to just let it go. But over time, you start feeling you're walking through a space that's delicate. Not because anything's shattered just yet, but because the damage keeps showing up in the same spot. now you're moving differently. Not because you're fragile, but because the relationship is. You're watching your step, trying not to press too hard or speak too loudly. We're definitely trying not to need too much. Because you've been here before. You're not going to be there. You're not going to be there. You're not going to be there. And the last time you spoke up, they turned it around on you. And that's the crack in the foundation. It's not the disagreement itself, but the way they rewrite it to make you feel you're the problem. And the longer you stay, the more normal that starts to feel. maybe you are overreacting. Or maybe this is just what relationships feel when you're hard to love. But it's not. And you're not hard to love. They just made you feel that way. All of this is just a show. And it's a quiet erosion of your self-worth. another sign of covert narcissism that doesn't seem narcissistic on the surface is they turn your pain into theirs. maybe you're finally honest about something that hurt. You're not blaming them. You're just trying to be real about how something landed with you. And instead of hearing you, they go quiet. Or they get withdrawn. Or they act kind of wounded. you just said something really unfair. And then suddenly, the conversation isn't about what happened. It's about how bad you made them feel. they might say something , I guess I can't do anything . Or I'm the worst partner in the world, aren't I? And now here you are comforting them for something they did to you. It's subtle. And it doesn't always come with name calling. It just kind of flips the emotional weight onto your side of the scale. they're the ones who've been hurt the most in this interaction. And now they have to focus on you. But the problem is, it works because you are empathetic. You don't want to hurt someone you care about. you backpedal and you soften your words. And the next time you might not bring it up at all. Because somewhere along the way, the safest move became silence. And that's another shift in the foundation. It's not just that cracks are forming. It's that you're starting to walk around them. you start arranging your words, your tone, and even your emotions around their sense of purpose. It's about sensitivity. But the truth is it's not real vulnerability. It's emotional deflection. Because instead of sitting with the impact of what they did, they make your pain about them. And the damage that does is not loud or explosive, but it keeps you from ever really being seen. And that makes the entire relationship feel off balance, even when everything on the surface still looks fine. another sign of covert narcissism that does not look super narcissistic on the surface, is that we are being a bit too open and we're kind of talking about what you're doing. surface is they help you in ways that actually leave you off balance. maybe they do something for you without being asked. Maybe they fix something or offer a solution, or they swoop in just at the moment to take care of it for you. And on the surface, it looks thoughtful. You should feel supported, but instead you kind of feel displaced. imagine somebody rearranged your kitchen while you were out, and now you're supposed to be grateful that they saved you from this mess that you didn't actually have. And now you have no idea where anything is and everything feels chaos. But at the same time, you're supposed to thank them. And if you don't thank them, if you don't respond in the way they expect, suddenly you become ungrateful or difficult or impossible to help. next time you smile and you play along and you tell yourself it's fine. Maybe they were just trying. But deep down, something has shifted because the message wasn't, I've got your back. It was you needed. Me to step in. And that's what slowly breaks your trust in yourself. Because now every time you try to take the lead, they're already one step ahead, offering a fix you didn't ask for and making sure how much easier they made your life. And this is where the house metaphor really starts to sink in. No pun intended. You thought you were building something together, but somehow you've ended up in a space that doesn't quite feel yours anymore. You're living in their version. You're living in the room of support and constantly rearranging your comfort just to keep the peace. another sign of covert narcissism that is not obvious upfront is when they quietly withhold warmth. maybe you push back on something or you disappoint them in a way that wasn't even intentional and they don't blow up. They don't even argue. They just kind of drop out. the tone changes and the energy is completely different and you feel it. haven't said a word. And maybe that's the part that gets to you the most because it's not always subtle. Sometimes it's quite obvious, they're making a point by stepping back, but not giving you anything solid to respond to. now you're trying to fix something that you can't name and you start wondering if you were too harsh or too cold, or maybe just said the wrong thing. And before it, you're softening your tone. You're checking your words. You're working to bring the warmth back in, even though you're not the one who turned it off. And that's the pattern because they don't need to fight you directly. All they need is to go quiet long enough for you to start chasing that closeness again. And you will because you've felt the warmth before and what it's when it's there. That's how it becomes control. It's the heat's technically on, but the room never warms up. And instead of asking why, you just keep layering up. You keep adjusting. And you keep blaming yourself for the cold. another sign of covert narcissism that's not obvious in a relationship is they make you feel that the issue is how you said something. maybe you bring something up calmly and clearly. You've probably rehearsed it in your head to make sure it's fair and reasonable, probably a million times over. And somehow it still doesn't land. they act confused or they say you're being too intense or they pick apart your tone or wording instead of explaining it. And that's when you start to feel the warmth back in. And that's when you start engaging with the actual point. And suddenly the conversation's about how you said it or the words you chose. And it's not about the topic at all. And you find yourself explaining things that shouldn't need explaining. Simple things, human things, why you felt hurt or why it's not to be dismissed, but they just keep twisting it. you try again and again. Thinking maybe if you just say it the way, they'll finally get it. But they never do. And then it's a vicious cycle. And you don't know what to do. And then you do because that's not their goal the thing is they're not confused they're actually dodging and the more you explain the more lost you are going to feel and over time you stop bringing things up all together not because you don't care but because you're tired of feeling nothing makes sense anymore and that confusion is absolutely the point for them because as long as you're doubting how you're saying it you'll never get to why it needed to be said in the first place another sign of covert narcissism that shows up in a relationship but is not always obvious is they forget things that don't benefit them maybe you circle back to a conversation you had something they said or something they promised maybe something that really mattered to you and they act it never happened naturally you'll get the i don't remember saying that you must be thinking of something else or that's not what i meant and now you're not just hurt you're defending your memory and you're finding yourself digging through old texts and reading messages trying to find proof that you're not making this up because you're not but the more they deny the more you start to wonder if maybe you misunderstood or maybe you just wanted to hear something they never actually said and this is how it works they don't erase the story just the parts that hold them accountable and every time they do they repaint over the same wall the crack was never there in the first place you imagined it and the fact that you keep trying to prove what actually happened is not about clarity that's survival because when the people around you keep rewriting the past you start to lose your footing in the present another way covert narcissism shows up in a relationship that's not super obvious is that the narcissist is warm in public but cold in private when other people are around they're charming thoughtful engaged and they smile when they talk to you maybe they make jokes they touch your shoulder you're close and to everyone else it looks you're lucky it looks the relationship is solid but then you get home and everything shifts then they're quiet or distant or they're just not interested and it's not just one bad day and it's not necessarily that there's even a reason it's that there's warmth when people are watching and coldness when they're not interested it's not about being a bad person it's about the fact that you're a good person and that you're a good person and that you're good for someone else you're a good person and that's why i'm sure that you have to be a good person because you're a good person they're not and that split starts to wear on you because when the house looks pristine from the outside no one would imagine that the basement floods every time it rains you start wondering if maybe you're the problem maybe you're expecting too much but you're not you're just noticing the gap and that's the danger of this kind of covert behavior it doesn't just make you feel unseen it makes you feel crazy for seeing what no one else can another sign that covert narcissism is present that is not super obvious is that you're always tired but there's no obvious reason maybe nothing huge has happened you haven't had some explosive fight you may haven't said anything that's outright cruel but you're tired and you can't quite explain why not tired you need a nap tired your brain doesn't stop scanning for what mood they're in tired you're constantly trying to say the things in the way it doesn't set something off even though half the time you don't even know what that something is and maybe people around you wouldn't get it because everything looks fine you're still functioning the relationship looks normal but you don't feel normal you feel off on edge kind of you're walking around with a low battery all the time and you don't even remember when it started draining and here's the thing there's no big collapse there's no breaking point no emergency per se but that doesn't mean there's no damage because now you're constantly maintaining things that shouldn't need maintaining you're keeping the peace you're filling in the emotional gaps explaining things to yourself that don't actually make sense just you can stay upright in a space that never really lets you rest it's the house is still standing but only because you're running around with duct tape and drywall mud trying to keep the place livable and you don't even know when that became your job you just know that's not what you're doing and that's why you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're not keeping things that are important to you now you're tired and the worst part is you've started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel tired and the worst part is you've started to think that's just what love is supposed to feel another sign of covert narcissism that is not obviously narcissistic on the surface is that they tell you what they want to hear but they never follow through maybe they say exactly what you've been wanting to hear that they're going to change that they finally understand how much this has affected you or that things will be different and in the moment it feels real you can finally exhale but then time passes and nothing happens, or the story changes, or maybe they act you misunderstood what they meant. And when you bring it up, they twist it. They say, again, I never said that, or that's not how I remember it. And now you're stuck between what they said and what they're doing, between what you felt and what they're pretending never happened. This is future faking. It's giving you just enough hope to keep you emotionally invested, but never enough follow through to actually build anything real. to bring it back to the house analogy, it's they sketch out this beautiful renovation, ? And they promised the upgrades, the lighting in this space. But when it's time to show up and start the work, they disappear. And you're left in the same old house holding blueprints that were never meant to be followed. And maybe the hardest part is you weren't asking for fantasies. You just wanted something solid and something honest. But when someone keeps promising a future they have no intention of creating. What they're really doing is buying time. While you keep living in a house that was never going to be finished. maybe it didn't look toxic at first. Maybe there were no screaming matches, no obvious threats. Maybe there were just quiet shifts, confusing moments and little betrayals that didn't feel betrayals at the time. And that's exactly why covert narcissism is hard to see, because the damage doesn't hit all at once. It builds slowly. Underneath the surface. Until one day you realize you're exhausted, doubting yourself, and living in something that doesn't feel safe anymore. And if any part of you is still trying to explain it away, if you're still questioning whether it really counts as betrayal, watch this video next. It'll help you name the things they hoped you'd never see clearly. And be sure to hit that button before you go if you haven't already. And I will see you again soon.
