 Welcome to another Friday night. We're looking at the 85 characteristics of complex trauma. So the  way that complex trauma affects people, the way they learn to cope, the maladaptive  survival strategies that  kept the child safe, but began to cause problems in adult life.  Today, I want to look at how complex trauma affects the emotional world and  and just to say up front is, to me, in working with clients all the time, it's just very  sad to watch the huge amount of damage that happens in the emotional world, how we try to cope  with painful emotions that becomes very maladaptive and causes all kinds of problems in adult life.  So I want to just give you a bunch of the different characteristics that come out of complex trauma  around emotions. But before I do it, I just want to give you kind of a backdrop of information  that will help you understand all of these characteristics even better. So the first thing  to understand is that the brain is designed for really four feel good chemicals. So it wants to  have dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins and those all come out of safety, connection,  their make a child feel very good. What happens with complex trauma when there's danger,  when the child can't connect, is those four chemicals are absent somewhat in pretty much in  the brain. And they're replaced with cortisol, adrenaline and opioids. So instead of getting these  four feel good chemicals, they're getting other chemicals that are trying to help them escape  pain. But there's pain is really what is happening mainly in the child's life. The reality for those  children, then, is they can't resolve the pain on their own. Nobody's helping them resolve the  pain. They're not old enough to have tools to resolve the pain. They can't escape the pain.  And so these negative emotions are there, but then they just keep getting added to, added to,  added to. So there's more and more pain piling up inside of them. The second thing to understand  is that emotions in a healthy situation and a healthy family are designed to train a child  in positive ways. They're like the lights on a dashboard. They tell you something's wrong  underneath the hood in your environment so that you can fix it. So when a child is in pain,  the emotion of pain or fear, what does it do? It pulls them to want to connect to mom and dad.  It pulls them to want to express their needs. It pulls them in a healthy direction that would  provide safety, healing and help them resolve. But what happens to a child in complex trauma?  They experience hurt and pain. They follow those instincts. They go to mom and dad. They express  their needs, their feelings, and they get rejected. They get punished. They get neglected. They get  shamed. So going in the positive direction is actually resulted in more pain. And so now when they  experience pain, the brain now pulls them in an opposite direction. I'm going to isolate. I'm going  shut down. I am not going to talk to anybody. I'm going to deny that I have needs.  So the limbic brain is now pulling them in the wrong direction in a self-destructive direction.  The limbic brain now has been mistrained and it is no longer a reliable guide.  So that's big picture. Now if you look at this graph, a child in a healthy home,  the red line on the top is they're mainly experiencing positive emotions. And when they experience  a negative emotion, parents comfort them, nurture them, give them tools to resolve it.  And so it's resolved. It doesn't stay there. They go back to a positive emotion. But what are you  seeing with the child in complex trauma? Most of their emotions are negative. They can't resolve  them. They're getting more and more negative emotions all the time. And so you can see this is  not a very pleasant world to live in. This is a very painful world that can't be resolved.  And so because of that, the brain then goes to solutions that it hopes will resolve these emotions,  fix this living in constant pain and emptiness. And that's where these characteristics come from.  So the very first one is that most people from complex trauma become emotional stuffers.  I can't resolve the emotion of pain. I can't fix it. So just stuff it. Somehow get rid of it.  And part of what they do with that is they repress the emotions. But then they kind of see all  emotions as bad because all of their emotions have only led to more painful situations.  Or they see emotions as unnecessary. Who needs emotions? I just need to be in my head and think and  figure stuff out in life. Emotions just make life messy. Emotions make life difficult. They add  more problems. So emotions are bad and unnecessary. So different methods are used by the brain to  try to suppress the emotions to stuff them down so that they're kind of below the conscious level.  So number one is as soon as they feel a negative emotion, it's like a switch flips in their head  and they immediately shove it down. They immediately repress it. Some of that can even happen  subconsciously for them. They're not even aware that they do it. They've done it for so long.  Others as soon as they feel emotions, they escape to their head and more and more, they just live in  their head. And so the emotional world is something that they avoid at all costs and they justify it  by they're just totally thinking through life constantly and that to them is very healthy.  Some children they go to the mindset of whatever because what they've realized is if you care about  something, then it hurts more when you lose it. So don't care about anything.  Just whatever about everything. Don't get attached to anything. Don't have any feelings towards  anything because that will only add more pain ultimately to you. So with that, for some kids,  is they just heart in their heart. Don't love. Don't have warm emotions. Don't connect. Just  be a hard person. That's how you protect yourself from pain. So it's turning the heart into a  stone so that it can't be penetrated by anything. Some, instead of feeling emotions, I'd rather just  stay busy. So I need constant distractions. As long as I'm busy doing something, then I don't have  time to feel. So I become a workaholic. I'll constantly be doing something that keeps me from feeling.  Others, let's medicate emotions. As soon as I feel them, so I can use distractions, but I can also  use sex. I can also use food. I can also use gambling, TV, whatever, anything that creates a pleasure  that's artificial, but it's a pleasure that meditates the emotions. Or I can use anger.  So if I get angry, then I don't feel pain. So I use other emotions to try to medicate the pain.  For many, they end up in what we would define as emotional anorexia. They've pushed down, suppressed  their emotions for so long. They no longer even know they're there. It's like the person who  suppressed their hunger desire for so long, they no longer feel hunger. So emotional anorexia,  I've seen it in so many people. They don't even, they're not even aware of their emotions.  You ask them what they're feeling. They don't know. They have repressed it for so long. It's almost  like it's a system that's been shut down and doesn't even know how to work and isn't even acknowledged.  So that seems to work for the child. But in adult life, they start to have problems.  So problem number one is when you are suppressing all of your emotions, basically what you're saying  is I'm weak because I have these weak emotions. These emotions are bad. They're part of me that I  don't like. These emotions, if I show them, embarrass me. And so it just builds shame.  That because I have these emotions, because I have to repress them, I must be a bad person.  So they try to lock their emotions away. The second thing that happens is even though you repress  emotions, even though you try to convince yourself, you're just a thinker and you make all your  decisions based on thinking, your emotions are still operating your life at a subconscious level.  Your fear, your anger, all of that is still running the show. You're not aware of it,  but it is. And so you're making decisions often based on emotions more than on thinking.  You may have developed systems to deny that to yourself, but if you stop and look at it,  you'll probably see that it's there. The next problem is so you've got all these repressed emotions  that are down there. As soon as they are triggered, so somebody touches your fear. Somebody touches  your fear of abandonment, fear of disrespect, fear of criticism, fear of getting hurt,  fear of failure. All of a sudden you are going back to old behaviors. So you might be going along  in your life and living very healthy behaviors, but soon as that fear that you're not even aware of  gets triggered, you regressed old behaviors, old survival things. So as long as those emotions  stay repressed and you don't acknowledge them, you're only going to get healthy to a certain degree.  Because as long as they get triggered, you just keep going back to old behaviors. And so you don't  grow beyond that point. Another very tricky thing is when people repress emotions, they think they're  only repressing negative emotions. But in reality, you're repressing all emotions. You're repressing  your ability to feel a lot of positive emotions, to feel joy, to feel a contentment. So you can't  just divide negative from positive emotions and only repress one. You're repressing it all.  And it's making you feel like a robot dead inside, emotionally stunted. Then a lot of people,  when they shut down emotions, the way to make sure they do it is to harden themselves,  turn off their conscience so that I don't want to care. I don't want to feel guilty about anything.  So let's shut down my conscience. Let's shut down caring. So let's just get harder and harder  inside. Because everything makes me weak. Emotions make me weak. I need to be strong. So that means  I need to not feel. I need to be hard. So that usually then develops a person who's got a lot of  anger who doesn't have empathy. And that then leads to the next problem is it begins to affect  all your relationships. People can't get close to you. People want to have intimacy, but they can't  with you. There's a hardness. There's an inability to connect emotionally with people. People  see you as distant. People just say I try to connect, but you're emotionally unavailable.  All of those things begin to cause relationships to break down. So conflicts begin to increase  tensions, mount, and then you drift apart more and more. So it always affects relationships  negatively. That then, when you've shut down emotions, you are dead inside. You feel no joy.  There's a growing loneliness. There's a growing emptiness that is haunting for people.  So this stuffing of emotions is so common in complex trauma, but it is an major issue for people  to begin healing from in their recovery journey, to begin to allow themselves to feel emotions,  to identify emotions, to learn how to handle emotions, how to express emotions. That becomes  emotional intelligence. And it is a huge topic because a lot of people after they've repressed  emotions for so long, they don't even aren't aware they have emotions. They don't even know what  the feeling is. They don't auto-identify it. And it takes a lot of time to develop emotional  intelligence. So be patient with yourself. The next issue that comes out of all of this emotional  stuff with complex trauma is they have trouble regulating their emotions. So they dysregulate  very quickly. They go from zero to a hundred in a nanoseconds. So they're calm, one minute,  something happens, and then it's an explosion. They just can't regulate their emotions.  So let me go back to childhood. Children babies have no natural tools to regulate emotions.  They learn to regulate their emotions by having a co-regulator. And that co-regulator needs  to be a person who is calm, a person who is safe, so a person who's regulated themselves.  So the baby's vagus nerve, their neural section senses the vibes of this other person. Are they  stressed out? Are they angry? Are they safe? Okay, if they're safe, they're in a calm place,  then I can connect to them and regulate my own emotions. So that is where it starts. So what then  does the co-regulator, the parent do to help regulate this child? And as they regulate this child  over and over again, the child begins to learn tools to regulate themselves. Because they're picking  up from the parent, the things that they do that are helping them calm down. First thing that we've  come to realize about regulating emotions is, so if you look in a child in the womb,  where they feel safe, where they have a secure little world, they have a rhythm that they  are hearing all the time. And that's the mother's heartbeat. 60 to 80 beats a minute. And what we found  is that when a child is dysregulated, an infant is dysregulated, if they can return to hearing or  feeling the rhythm of 60 to 80 beats a minute, so rocking music that has a steady rhythm,  padding them on the back. All of a sudden, something in the brain goes, I feel safe again and they  can calm down. So rhythm has this amazing ability to regulate emotions. And so what we have found  is that for people coming out of complex trauma, when they're dysregulated,  often you can't think your way to a regulated state, you gotta go bottom up, you gotta go to  rhythm stuff. So, walking, dancing, doodling, even cleaning has a rhythm. A back rub, a massage,  music, all of that has a steady rhythm that can help regulate your emotions. And breathing  can be part of that as well. Because often when a child is dysregulated, they take a deep breath  and shudder and then they can regulate themselves. So rhythm is key. If a child though doesn't get  rhythm provided for them by the parents, so the parents leave them alone, the parents get angry at  them, the parents do not, be a co-regulator to them. The child typically will begin to develop  self-soothing activities. They will come across things that they find are helpful. So they'll suck  their thumb, they'll get a blanky, they'll get a teddy bear, they'll rock in their bed. But then  for some it, as it goes to stuff that seems to be soothing them, it has a rhythm, but it can become  destructive. So they'll start banging their head. They will start hitting themselves, pulling their  hair regularly. Some escape into a fantasy world, they dissociate that way. All of that seems  to be soothing, but it actually becomes self-destructive. And so it becomes very important for them in  recovery to learn healthy self-soothing versus unhealthy self-soothing. The other thing that happens  in the child who didn't have a parent who come in to regulate them, to give them the tools to  regulate, to provide the rhythm for them, is that they don't have a lot of tools to regulate  their emotions. And now when they have any negative emotion, fear, especially stress,  they disregulate quickly. Because they have no ability to know how to handle even the early  eight stages of stress and fear. And so that's where they go from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond.  And what's so important to understand is this person can be wonderful 99% of the time. But when  they get triggered and they disregulate in adult life, that's when the damage happens in the  relationship. The other thing then that we've learned regulates a child, a baby, is they're connecting  to this co-regulator. So connection helps the vagus nerve when they connect with a safe person  to become regulated. So they need connection to a safe person who's not going to judge them.  Then they need the need met. So rhythm helps. Connection is vital. Then the need has to be met.  When that happens, then the child is regulated. Now, beyond if those don't happen,  what the brain then does to regulate the child is produce chemicals, opioids. Those are designed  to help the child regulate when nothing else is working. And so in extreme cases today for  people in recovery, if they're so dysregulated that nothing is working, they may need medication  temporarily. So let's go to what dysregulates a child. The first thing is when they have a need  that's not met. So you have your vagus nerve is keeping track of all your needs in your body,  physical needs, emotional needs, all your organs. So if a need is out of balance, so your internal  systems are out of balance, you feel discomfort, you feel hunger, you feel thirst, you feel itch,  you feel a pain, you feel a cramp. All of those things cause discomfort. Then the child cries.  The child expresses that need. That's the only way they can. So the parents come figure connect,  figure out what the need is, meet the need, soothe the child, everything is taken care of.  So having a system that is out of balance, dysregulates us. But secondly,  when a child is trying to connect, which they need for survival, but they're not able to connect,  then that dysregulates them greatly. Because now they feel all alone, now they feel afraid.  So not connecting, dysregulates. The third thing is if their perception or interception of the  vagus nerve is picking up danger. So there's danger in their external world or their vibes are sensing,  somebody is not safe. That dysregulates the child. So if there's the potential for feeling,  getting hurt, then the stress system is activated. The person becomes dysregulated because now it's  we got to go to fight flight to get out of here because this is not a safe situation. So as I said,  emotional dysregulation comes out of a child not being able to connect, not getting their needs,  not having a co-regulator to soothe them. And so they just don't have the ability to deal with  intense emotions, to regulate their own emotions. And now when they're triggered, they go  nanosecond zero to a hundred tons of damage done. That causes many people to go, I think I need help  because I'm hurting those I love. And those are the only ones I'm hurting greatly. And I just can't  continue to do that. But learning to regulate emotions is such an important skill. And there's  so many practical tools that you can learn to do that. But there are many tools that need to be learned.  The next characteristic is emotional reasoning. So it's the limbic brain that is reasoning.  So as you think, healthy reasoning for us comes out of the cortex where we can look at all the  evidence, the facts, look at it from different perspectives, weigh out everything, hear different input  from different people. And we end up with some good reasoning. The limbic brain, when it reasons,  it doesn't look at facts. Its primary basis for determining truth is how it feels. So if I feel  a certain way, that must be the truth of the situation. So if it feels like you rejected me because  you set a boundary with me, then you must have rejected me. You might be setting a boundary to make  a healthier relationship. But that feels like rejection. So you must be rejecting me. So I'm not  looking at evidence. I'm looking at feelings. If I'm having a bad day and nobody calls me, nobody  texts me. I guess nobody cares about me. That's what it feels like. So it must be true.  So what can happen for people in complex trauma where they only have the limbic brain is all of  their reasoning comes out of the limbic brain. And if they remain in complex trauma, the limbic  brain continues to be the dominant force in how their brain works. So then how they get to  adult life in recovery. And they're learning to reason out of their cortex. And they're doing a  better and better job at that. But as soon as their limbic brain gets triggered, all of a sudden,  they go back to limbic brain reasoning, emotional reasoning. All of a sudden, their whole sense of  this is true. Why? Not because of the evidence because I feel a certain way. Now if you try to reason  with a person when they're in that state, it's very, very difficult. It's almost impossible  because they don't see that a lot of their thinking is irrational because it feels so true. How can  it be wrong? And so often in early recovery, people when they get triggered, they go to emotional  reasoning and they just can't see that there's a problem. It takes a while for them to begin to  realize, wow, that was really distorted. That discounted or excluded a whole bunch of facts  in that moment. I got tunnel vision. I got distorted, but it felt so true. The danger is is when  you're in that emotional reasoning state, that's when people can make some bad decisions. So all of a  sudden, they're ghosting a healthy person who set a boundary with them because they say, wow,  feels like you rejected me. So I guess you rejected me. It feels like you're abandon me. So I  guess you're abandon me. So I'll abandon you. Or I think you disrespected me because you set a  boundary. So I'm going to develop a resentment against you. I'm now going to see you as a very  unkind person. I'm not going to see you as a person who just disrespects people. And obviously,  you got a resentment that's not based on facts. It's based on a distortion, a lie that came out of  your emotional reasoning. So in recovery, it becomes so important to begin to understand or  know or identify when you go into your limbic brain. Now, at first, often you don't even realize  that. Sometimes you need somebody else to point that out to you. But once you begin to realize,  oops, I'm in my limbic brain. I'm feeling intense emotions. Okay, all my reasoning is probably  going to get distorted now. So don't trust it. But I got to get back to my cortex. I got to  regulate my emotions. I got to figure out how to calm myself down and get back to my cortex. And  that could take several minutes. I could take several hours. I could even take several days for  some people. So it's just being aware that my limbic brain has been mistrained. It now is an  unreliable guide. It has distorted reasoning. So if I go there, I got to figure out how to get  out of there and back to my cortex. The next characteristic that comes out of complex trauma around  emotions is anxiety issues. So most people 90% at least of people with complex trauma have anxiety  and depression issues. So anxiety is the emotion we feel when we don't think we have resources  to handle a situation or not sure if we have resources to handle situations. So if you think of  the child in complex trauma, their needs aren't being met. They're facing problems. Nobody's helping  them. Nobody's giving them tools. They feel all alone in facing this scary world. So they constantly  feel danger. They constantly then feel stress overwhelmed. And that means they constantly feel fear  and anxiety. That becomes their normal every day. They feel it. It's their default setting now.  And so the sad part of complex trauma is that because the child lived within this big scary world with  no support and no tools, fear becomes their main emotion. Anxiety becomes their constant companion.  But what is important to understand is that we often see fear and anxiety as a bad emotion.  But fear and anxiety were actually designed. Their main purpose is to protect the child. They are  to alert us to danger so that we can get to safety so that we can either resolve the situation  or fight or flight. So we got to fix it or flee it. That is what fear and anxiety purposes. So  fear and anxiety because danger can do so much damage and hurt us so badly, fear and anxiety  tend to be very intense emotions. They're not pleasant to live with. But they don't care. Their only  function is to keep you safe. They don't care whether you're happy. They don't care about your  relationships. They don't care about your life goals. It's all about survival. And so they if they  perceive a threat that threatens your safety, then they're indifferent to everything else in your life.  All they care about is keeping you safe. So with complex trauma, they could never get you to safety.  So they become constant companions that you can't resolve. So they then become  maladaptive over time. Instead of protecting you now, they now drive you in situations that give  instant safety but long-term greater problems, long-term greater danger. That's the problem with  anxiety fear in a complex trauma world. It goes from being a healthy system to a maladaptive system.  So a couple of things that begin to happen. For many people, they get tired of living with  constant anxiety. And so they start to shut down systems that produce fear. They shut off their  alarm system. They stop listening to their gut. They stop listening to emotions. They're just all  painful. They're just all negative. They just add stress and anxiety in my life. I don't like it.  Let's shut them down. So now, if they've shut down their gut, their alarm systems, now in adult  life, they can walk into a danger situation where their gut is trying to say, this is an unsafe  person. You may get raped. They ignore it. And they actually walk into danger now because they've  shut down all their alarm systems. Other people don't shut down. They go to hyper radar.  They go to hyper vigilance. I am going to develop a radar system where I detect  every possible danger there is. And every possible thing that might lead to danger. So I'm going  to try to pick up the early warning signs of danger. And that usually means I'm going to read danger  in where danger doesn't actually exist. And so these people live with constant anxiety. They  develop a huge mistrust of people. They even develop irrational fears, paranoia about stuff that's  not even true. So it gets even worse. So learning to deal with anxiety in healthy ways,  learning to resolve problems, to manage anxiety, not just go to fight flight.  It's such an important part of recovery. The next emotion that is affected by complex trauma  is depression. So I think it's important to understand that I think complex trauma contributes  to depression in a bunch of different ways. So we tend to think of depression. We kind of just  put it in a general box. You're depressed. It must be a chemical imbalance in the brain. That's  could be true. But I think complex trauma helps us realize there's other factors that feed  depression besides just chemical imbalance in the brain. So I think first of all of a child,  we talked about at the beginning where your emotions basically exist in a negative environment.  You constantly are feeling pain. You can't resolve that pain is getting worse. Your needs aren't  being met. You feel empty. You can't connect. There's all kinds of negative emotions that just grow,  grow, grow. Then your circumstances, there's constant danger. There's constant stress. So your  circumstances feed these negative emotions. So the negative of your life far outweighs the positives.  That just takes its toll. That gradually grinds you into deeper and deeper depression. So that's  why we say that many people with complex trauma have a low grade depression. They're just constantly  a sadness that is there. But there's something else. When a child is in complex trauma,  they're constantly in danger or perceived danger. So they're in their sympathetic nervous system  all the time. Their parasympathetic nervous system whose purpose is to provide rest and healing  and balance to your nervous system so that you don't burn out isn't allowed to kick in.  So your go, go, go, survival mode, energy mode without the necessary rest and healing.  Over time you're heading towards burnout. What we realize is that sometimes depression kicks in  as a way to try and get you out of your sympathetic nervous system into your parasympathetic nervous  system. It's trying to protect you from totally burning out. Another thing is this. When you're  stuffing emotions all the time, it's like holding, trying to hold a beach ball under the water.  It takes a lot of emotional energy to hold down anger, to hold down fear, to hold down all the guilt  that you feel, to hold down all of the different emotions that you feel. You repress, repress,  and you just get exhausted emotionally and that can result in depression. Dissociation is  an other element here that leads to depression. So trauma, if it's so severe, the brain's way of  protecting is to retreat to an internal world, to dissociate from the present. And often what it's  saying is my nervous system is overwhelmed from this trauma. I need a way to escape my nervous  system and depression becomes a way to help a person escape living within their nervous system  that is overwhelmed. Then there's another thing. What happens with shame is I don't like myself,  I hate myself, I'm angry at myself, I'm critical of myself, so anger turns inward. An anger  turned inward can lead to depression. And then, sadly, for many people, depression has been  their normal since they were little kids. Every day sucked. Every day they were in their  sympathetic nervous system and so depression became what was necessary to help them survive.  It became their way of dissociating. They had anger turned inward. Depression was their normal  state and it becomes their default setting. Their brain begins to go, if I don't feel depressed,  I feel like something's wrong. If I don't feel depressed, I feel bad. I need to feel depressed,  to feel normal. And so they develop systems in their thinking, they develop systems in their  behavior to try to keep them feeling depressed. It's almost like they're addicted to needing  to feel depressed, to feel normal. Another element that feeds into this is one of the most important  things to stabilize us, to give us the positive chemicals in the brain is connection with safe  people. True, healthy intimacy. If I don't have connection, I don't have those four chemicals  and then depression begins to settle in. One of the greatest healing elements of depression  is beginning to connect with healthy, safe people again. Then there's one other thing that comes  out of the shame thing. And it's shame lies that we tell ourselves, so nobody wants to connect  with me. Anybody who gets to know me will reject me or abandon me. I only have value if I perform.  My value comes from my external world. I have no inherent value. If I set boundaries, I am a  bad person. I am selfish. I'm unloving. If I take care of myself, I am selfish end of loving.  In order for people to like me, I have to be perfect. I have to give up all my needs. I have to  become smaller. If I fail, I am a failure. When you believe those lies, that leads to depression.  So complex trauma just can feed depression in many different ways. There's one other one that's  tricky. What comes out of complex trauma is a lot of grief. You have a lot of losses. Not just  things that you had that you lost, but you also have things that you should have had but never got.  So you lost something that you should have had but never had. That's a very real loss. So part  of what happens is the child is constantly experiencing losses. And one of the elements or stages of grief  is sadness, depression. This sucks. I should be sad. I should feel depressed. But some people  get stuck there. Now, for most people, when they go through a loss, the sad stage, it can go on for  weeks, for months, for even years. It's part of the limbic brain gradually coming to terms and accepting  the reality of what has happened and being able to let go. But what I have found with people from  complex trauma is that often they get stuck in the sadness stage. There's something in them because  they've never fully connected with anybody that just has trouble letting go. There's something in them  that feels guilty for moving on. There's something in them that just it fits into their default  setting of depression. And so to go on and enjoy life again feels wrong. So they get stuck in this  sadness stage of grieving. And it just keeps the depression alive. It keeps them having a reason to  justify staying in this depressed state. So it's so important to say that most people from complex  trauma have dealt with depression over 90%. And that means that most have had suicidal ideation at  some time because life sucks. The brain thinks I've tried everything to escape this pain. I've tried  everything to resolve this pain. There's no solution that I have been able to find. Therefore,  it makes sense that the only solution left is to kill myself. To have suicidal ideation doesn't  mean you're planning to act on it. It just means your brain is continuing to explore options to  escape the pain. So don't beat yourself up about it. Recognize that it happens and continue to reach  out for help. So one of the things that I've realized with many people from complex trauma is they've  lived with mild depression as their normal or depression, deeper depression as their normal. They're  default setting. And so they don't even think they're depressed because that's been their normal.  That's how they think everybody is. And so it's important to begin to understand the signs of depression  so that I can begin to identify whether I am depressed or not. So signs of depression  you feel like you're being sucked into this black hole. There's just a darkness that is pulling  at you. You begin to lose interest in things that usually you enjoy. You begin to lose motivation  to do things. Even the things that you enjoyed. Those are signs of depression, losing interest,  losing motivation. When you do stuff that normally would have given you pleasure, it's not giving  you pleasure anymore. So more and more of life becomes a drudgery. More and more life takes  effort. You feel more and more robotic. You're going through the motions. Nothing is giving you pleasure.  And then there's a growing feelings of worthlessness. I have nothing to offer.  My life sucks. I'm not a happy person. Nobody wants to be with me. I feel I don't have the energy  to perform anything. I just have this growing feeling of worthlessness. And then there's a growing  feeling of helplessness. I can't get myself out of this. I just am growing and feeling overwhelmed.  More and more. I'm losing the ability to cope with anything. Those are growing inside of you.  That not leads to a growing feelings of anti-social. I just want to flight. I want to avoid people.  I resist social interaction. It just takes too much work. I'm not in a good headspace. It creates  panic. So I just want to isolate all the time. Then there's a usually growing irritability. You just  don't have the emotional reserves to handle problems. To handle change. To handle annoyances.  Then you begin more negative. More pessimistic. You just see the dark, the negative side of things.  And then for people that can lead to a change in weight, change in appetite, you don't want to eat  at all or you want to eat all the time. Change in sleep patterns. You want to sleep all the time or  you can't sleep. For some people they begin to have physical pain on top of the emotional pain.  Others they begin to get tired. Overwhelming fatigue is constantly there. They have difficulty  concentrating on anything and it begins to affect their memory. So those are all characteristics  of deepening depression. So if you have those, reach out for help. Learning to manage depression,  learning to improve depression becomes such a vital part in recovery. There's a ton of tools  to learn but it is so important. But there is hope. The final one I want to cover today is wanting  to hope but being afraid to hope. This one is so important to understand. What happens to a child  is they come into life. They have this need to be authentic. This need to have all their needs met.  So they've got 12 basic needs. Their parents are supposed to meet those needs. Their parents let's  say don't meet some of the needs. The child then has this basic hope and the hope is if I change,  it must be my fault. If I change, if I do something differently, then my parents will meet my needs.  So there's a little graph there where the child, their need isn't met. They go, if I change,  then my need will get met and they have hope. So they start to go down the change road  with the hope road and it might look like, oh, it's going to work. It's going to work but then  their need doesn't get met. So what has happened there are two dynamics. Their need is not met.  That hurts. Their hope is dashed and that hurts. So they have two sources of pain now.  But children have this tremendous capacity to hope. So where their brain goes next is, okay,  if I just tried this thing, then I'll get my need met and they hope again and a way they go  and they pursue this new option with great hope and then that option backfires. So their need  doesn't get met. Their hopes get dashed. But children have committed tremendous capacity to hope.  So they come up with another option and they have full hope that it's going to work.  What we have seen is that a child would do that for a year after year after year, continue to hope,  continue to come up with new options. And then around 10 to 12, 13 years old, something in the brain  goes, you know what? I'm getting tired of getting my hopes up and having them dashed. That hurts a lot.  Nothing seems to be working. It's really feeling hopeless. It feels like there's not a solution  so I'm not going to get my hopes up again because they have my hopes dashed, actually hurts more  than not having my needs met. So they stop hoping. And that's when many children go into drugs,  alcohol, into very hardened maladaptive behaviors because as I'm not even going to try anymore,  I'm just going to live for instant pleasure. However, I can get it. So they come into recovery.  And what is recovery based on? There's hope that you can heal. There's hope that you can get healthy.  And they go, no, not going to hope. But they want to hope. They desire to have a healthy life.  They desire to heal. So initially often, you have to piggyback on somebody else's hope.  And they go, you know what? I've been through this. I've gone through the steps. I've done the work  and it pays off. There is grounds for hope based on evidence. What you had as a child was a child  trying to gain hope out of a solution that wasn't even viable because the problem wasn't you.  The problem was the other person. What you have now is a viable solution. So hope is legitimate.  That's scary for a child. And so what can happen for many people in recovery is they piggyback off  somebody else's hope. They start to see their life improve. They get their health back. They get  their job back. They start to get relationships back. They get their kids back. And positive things  are happening there. And all of a sudden their hope starts to go from piggybacking off somebody else's  to hope is starting to be born inside of them. And they go, oh, oh, oh, do I get my hopes up?  That this is going to work. Because if I get my hopes up and then it doesn't work,  my hopes are going to get dashed again. And that is so painful. And so what many people do in  recovery as soon as they start to hope again is a system switches on in the brain that says nope.  Hope is too dangerous. Let's sabotage all the good stuff happening in our life. Let's go back  to pain and not hoping because it feels safer there. So this desire to hope but afraid to hope  is a powerful subconscious system that works in people and can do so much damage in recovery.  And so it's so important for people to realize in recovery that okay, I'm starting to hope.  But my hope is based on viable solutions. My hope has been proven by other people who've  done this stuff. So I'm not going to give in to my limbic brain and go to sabotage. I am going  to stay in my cortex and get past the fear of my hopes being dashed again and stick at this long  enough for it to prove that it's working and that my hope is legitimate. That is such a critical  piece for people in their recovery journey. So those are emotions today that have been damaged  maladaptive by complex trauma. I hope that helps you kind of gain insight into your own life  and into a bit of what the healing journey involves. Next time we're going to continue with some more  of the emotional characteristics. But that's it for today. Thank you for being with us. Have a great  weekend. We'll see you next week.
