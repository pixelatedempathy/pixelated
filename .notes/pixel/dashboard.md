## Implementation Plan: Therapist Dashboard & Progress Tracking

Based on my analysis of the codebase, I can see that:

1. __Current Status__: The TrainingSession.tsx component is already scaffolded and includes basic session controls, but the therapist dashboard and progress tracking features are not yet implemented.

2. __Existing Infrastructure__: There's already a solid foundation with:

   - Analytics dashboard components and hooks (`useAnalyticsDashboard`)
   - Session management infrastructure (`db/session.sql`)
   - Training session UI framework
   - Design system with tokens and components

Here's my concrete plan for implementing the therapist dashboard & progress tracking:

### Phase 1: Dashboard Component Architecture

- [x] Create `TherapistDashboard.tsx` component in `src/components/dashboard/`
- [x] Implement dashboard layout with responsive grid system
- [x] Integrate existing `AnalyticsCharts` component for data visualization
- [x] Add session progress tracking widgets
- [x] Create progress visualization components (progress bars, charts, metrics)

### Phase 2: Progress Tracking Integration ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Extend `useConversationMemory` hook to track session progress metrics
- [x] Implement progress data structure for therapist sessions
- [x] Add progress tracking to `TrainingSession.tsx` component
- [x] Create progress snapshot functionality for session milestones

**Enhancements Made:**
- Extended `useConversationMemory` hook with comprehensive progress metrics tracking
- Added session timing, message counting, skill scoring, and milestone tracking
- Integrated progress tracking directly into `TrainingSession.tsx` with real-time updates
- Created automatic progress snapshots at key milestones (25%, 50%, 75%, 100%)
- Added conversation history display with role-based styling

### Phase 3: Data Visualization & Analytics ✅ COMPLETED

- [x] Enhance `useAnalyticsDashboard` to include therapist training metrics
- [x] Create specialized charts for therapy progress tracking
- [x] Implement session comparison views (current vs. previous sessions)
- [x] Add skill development tracking visualizations

**Enhancements Made:**
- Created `useTherapistAnalytics` hook for therapist-specific data processing
- Developed `TherapyProgressCharts` component with multiple visualization types
- Implemented session progress timeline charts
- Created skill development radar charts
- Added session comparison views with trend analysis
- Built skill improvement timeline visualizations

### Phase 4: Backend Integration ✅ COMPLETED


- [x] Extend session API endpoints to store progress data
- [x] Implement progress tracking in PostgreSQL schema
- [x] Add therapist evaluation feedback storage and retrieval (API & DB)

**Backend Infrastructure Created:**
- Extended PostgreSQL schema with progress tracking tables (`session_analytics`, `skill_development`, `session_milestones`, `session_comparisons`, `session_feedback`)
- Created comprehensive session progress API endpoints (`/api/session/progress`, `/api/session/snapshots`, `/api/session/skills`, `/api/session/analytics`, `/api/session/comparison`)
- Added therapist evaluation feedback API and database integration
- Implemented database service layer (`sessionProgressService.ts`) for seamless data persistence
- Added comprehensive API tests for all endpoints, including feedback storage/retrieval

### Phase 5: UI/UX & Accessibility


- [ ] Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance for all dashboard components
- [ ] Implement proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
- [ ] Add keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Create responsive design for all device sizes

The implementation will leverage the existing analytics infrastructure while adding therapist-specific progress tracking features. This approach maintains consistency with the current codebase architecture while delivering the required functionality.

I understand. Let me create a proper markdown plan and save it to `.notes/pixel`, then begin the implementation.

## Implementation Plan: Therapist Dashboard & Progress Tracking

Based on my analysis of the codebase, here's my comprehensive plan:

### Current Project Status

- __TrainingSession.tsx__ is already scaffolded with basic session controls
- __useConversationMemory__ hook exists for session state management
- __Analytics infrastructure__ is in place with dashboard components and hooks
- __Backend API endpoints__ need to be implemented for session data and progress tracking

### Implementation Approach

I'll leverage the existing analytics dashboard infrastructure and extend it with therapist-specific progress tracking features.

### Detailed Implementation Steps

#### Phase 1: Dashboard Component Creation ✅ COMPLETED

1. ✅ Create `TherapistDashboard.tsx` component
2. ✅ Implement dashboard layout with responsive grid system
3. ✅ Integrate existing analytics charts for session data visualization
4. ✅ Add progress tracking widgets and metrics displays
5. ✅ Create session controls component for therapist session management

**Components Created:**
- `TherapistDashboard.tsx` - Main dashboard layout
- `SessionControls.tsx` - Session management controls
- `TherapistProgressTracker.tsx` - Progress visualization
- `ProgressBar.tsx` - Progress bar component
- `SessionMetrics.tsx` - Session metrics display

#### Phase 2: Progress Tracking Enhancement

1. Extend `useConversationMemory` to track session progress metrics
2. Implement progress data structure for therapist training sessions
3. Add progress tracking to existing `TrainingSession.tsx` component
4. Create progress snapshot functionality for session milestones

#### Phase 3: Data Visualization & Analytics

1. Enhance `useAnalyticsDashboard` to include therapist training metrics
2. Create specialized charts for therapy progress tracking
3. Implement session comparison views (current vs. previous sessions)
4. Add skill development tracking visualizations

#### Phase 4: Backend Integration

1. Extend session API endpoints to store progress data
2. Implement progress tracking in PostgreSQL schema
3. Add evaluation feedback storage and retrieval
4. Secure authentication and data storage mechanisms

#### Phase 5: UI/UX & Accessibility Compliance

1. Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance for all dashboard components
2. Implement proper ARIA labels and screen reader support
3. Add keyboard navigation support
4. Create responsive design for all device sizes

The implementation maintains consistency with the existing codebase architecture while delivering robust therapist dashboard and progress tracking functionality.
