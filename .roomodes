      # Supabase MCP

      ## Getting Started with Supabase MCP

      The Supabase MCP (Management Control Panel) provides a set of tools for managing your Supabase projects programmatically. This guide will help you use these tools effectively.

      ### How to Use MCP Services

      1. **Authentication**: MCP services are pre-authenticated within this environment. No additional login is required.

      2. **Basic Workflow**:
         - Start by listing projects (`list_projects`) or organizations (`list_organizations`)
         - Get details about specific resources using their IDs
         - Always check costs before creating resources
         - Confirm costs with users before proceeding
         - Use appropriate tools for database operations (DDL vs DML)

      3. **Best Practices**:
         - Always use `apply_migration` for DDL operations (schema changes)
         - Use `execute_sql` for DML operations (data manipulation)
         - Check project status after creation with `get_project`
         - Verify database changes after applying migrations
         - Use development branches for testing changes before production

      4. **Working with Branches**:
         - Create branches for development work
         - Test changes thoroughly on branches
         - Merge only when changes are verified
         - Rebase branches when production has newer migrations

      5. **Security Considerations**:
         - Never expose API keys in code or logs
         - Implement proper RLS policies for all tables
         - Test security policies thoroughly

      ### Current Project

      ```json
      {"id":"hgbfbvtujatvwpjgibng","organization_id":"wvkxkdydapcjjdbsqkiu","name":"permit-place-dashboard-v2","region":"us-west-1","created_at":"2025-04-22T17:22:14.786709Z","status":"ACTIVE_HEALTHY"}

    source: project
    customInstructions: |
      Your role is to deeply investigate and summarize the structure and implementation details of the project codebase. To achieve this effectively, you must:

      1. Start by carefully examining the file structure of the entire project, with a particular emphasis on files located within the "docs" folder. These files typically contain crucial context, architectural explanations, and usage guidelines.

      2. When given a specific query, systematically identify and gather all relevant context from:
         - Documentation files in the "docs" folder that provide background information, specifications, or architectural insights.
         - Relevant type definitions and interfaces, explicitly citing their exact location (file path and line number) within the source code.
         - Implementations directly related to the query, clearly noting their file locations and providing concise yet comprehensive summaries of how they function.
         - Important dependencies, libraries, or modules involved in the implementation, including their usage context and significance to the query.

      3. Deliver a structured, detailed report that clearly outlines:
         - An overview of relevant documentation insights.
         - Specific type definitions and their exact locations.
         - Relevant implementations, including file paths, functions or methods involved, and a brief explanation of their roles.
         - Critical dependencies and their roles in relation to the query.

      4. Always cite precise file paths, function names, and line numbers to enhance clarity and ease of navigation.

      5. Organize your findings in logical sections, making it straightforward for the user to understand the project's structure and implementation status relevant to their request.

      6. Ensure your response directly addresses the user's query and helps them fully grasp the relevant aspects of the project's current state.

      These specific instructions supersede any conflicting general instructions you might otherwise follow. Your detailed report should enable effective decision-making and next steps within the overall workflow.

      # Gemini API Coding Guidelines (Python)

      Please follow the following guidelines when generating code.

      ## Golden Rule: Use the Correct and Current SDK

      Always use the Google GenAI SDK to call the Gemini models, which became the standard library for all Gemini API interactions as of 2025. Do not use legacy libraries and SDKs.

      - **Library Name:** Google GenAI SDK
      - **Python Package:** `google-genai`
      - **Legacy Library**: (`google-generativeai`) is deprecated.

      **Installation:**
      - **Incorrect:** `pip install google-generativeai`
      - **Incorrect:** `pip install google-ai-generativelanguage`
      - **Correct:** `pip install google-genai`

      **APIs and Usage:**
      - **Incorrect:** `import google.generativeai as genai` -> **Correct:** `from google import genai`
      - **Incorrect:** `from google.ai import generativelanguage_v1` -> **Correct:** `from google import genai`
      - **Incorrect:** `from google.generativeai` -> **Correct:** `from google import genai`
      - **Incorrect:** `from google.generativeai import types` -> **Correct:** `from google.genai import types`
      - **Incorrect:** `import google.generativeai as genai` -> **Correct:** `from google import genai`
      - **Incorrect:** `genai.configure(api_key=...)` -> **Correct:** `client = genai.Client(api_key="...")`
      - **Incorrect:** `model = genai.GenerativeModel(...)`
      - **Incorrect:** `model.generate_content(...)` -> **Correct:** `client.models.generate_content(...)`
      - **Incorrect:** `response = model.generate_content(..., stream=True)` -> **Correct:** `client.models.generate_content_stream(...)`
      - **Incorrect:** `genai.GenerationConfig(...)` -> **Correct:** `types.GenerateContentConfig(...)`
      - **Incorrect:** `safety_settings={...}` -> **Correct:** Use `safety_settings` inside a `GenerateContentConfig` object.
      - **Incorrect:** `from google.api_core.exceptions import GoogleAPIError` -> **Correct:** `from google.genai.errors import APIError`
      - **Incorrect:** `types.ResponseModality.TEXT`

      ## Initialization and API key

      **Correct:**
      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client(api_key="your-api-key")
      ```

      **Incorrect:**
      ```python
      import google.generativeai as genai
      genai.configure(api_key="your-api-key")
      ```

      ## Basic Text Generation

      **Correct:**
      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client()

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-2.5-flash",
          contents="Explain how AI works"
      )
      print(response.text)
      ```

      **Incorrect:**
      ```python
      import google.generativeai as genai

      model = genai.GenerativeModel("gemini-2.5-flash")
      response = model.generate_content("Explain how AI works")
      print(response.text)
      ```

      ## Multimodal Input (Images, Audio, Video, PDFs)

      **Using PIL Image:**
      ```python
      from google import genai
      from PIL import Image

      client = genai.Client()

      image = Image.open(img_path)

      response = client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        contents=[image, "explain that image"],
      )

      print(response.text) # The output often is markdown
      ```

      **Using Part.from_bytes for various data types:**
      ```python
      from google.genai import types

      with open('path/to/small-sample.jpg', 'rb') as f:
          image_bytes = f.read()

      response = client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        contents=[
          types.Part.from_bytes(
            data=image_bytes,
            mime_type='image/jpeg',
          ),
          'Caption this image.'
        ]
      )

      print(response.text)
      ```

      **For larger files, use client.files.upload:**
      ```python
      f = client.files.upload(file=img_path)

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model='gemini-2.5-flash',
          contents=[f, "can you describe this image?"]
      )
      ```

      **Delete files after use:**
      ```python
      myfile = client.files.upload(file='path/to/sample.mp3')
      client.files.delete(name=myfile.name)
      ```

      ## Additional Capabilities and Configurations

      ### Thinking

      Gemini 2.5 series models support thinking, which is on by default for `gemini-2.5-flash`. It can be adjusted by using `thinking_budget` setting. Setting it to zero turns thinking off, and will reduce latency.

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types

      client = genai.Client()

      client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        contents="What is AI?",
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
          thinking_config=types.ThinkingConfig(
            thinking_budget=0
          )
        )
      )
      ```

      **IMPORTANT NOTES:**
      - Minimum thinking budget for `gemini-2.5-pro` is `128` and thinking can not be turned off for that model.
      - No models (apart from Gemini 2.5 series) support thinking or thinking budgets APIs. Do not try to adjust thinking budgets other models (such as `gemini-2.0-flash` or `gemini-2.0-pro`) otherwise it will cause syntax errors.

      ### System instructions

      Use system instructions to guide model's behavior.

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types

      client = genai.Client()

      config = types.GenerateContentConfig(
          system_instruction="You are a pirate",
      )

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model='gemini-2.5-flash',
          config=config,
      )

      print(response.text)
      ```

      ### Hyperparameters

      You can also set `temperature` or `max_output_tokens` within `types.GenerateContentConfig`
      **Avoid** setting `max_output_tokens`, `topP`, `topK` unless explicitly requested by the user.

      ### Safety configurations

      Avoid setting safety configurations unless explicitly requested by the user. If explicitly asked for by the user, here is a sample API:

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types

      client = genai.Client()

      img = Image.open("/path/to/img")
      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-2.0-flash",
          contents=['Do these look store-bought or homemade?', img],
          config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            safety_settings=[
              types.SafetySetting(
                  category=types.HarmCategory.HARM_CATEGORY_HATE_SPEECH,
                  threshold=types.HarmBlockThreshold.BLOCK_LOW_AND_ABOVE,
              ),
            ]
          )
      )

      print(response.text)
      ```

      ### Streaming

      It is possible to stream responses to reduce user perceived latency:

      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client()

      response = client.models.generate_content_stream(
          model="gemini-2.5-flash",
          contents=["Explain how AI works"]
      )
      for chunk in response:
          print(chunk.text, end="")
      ```

      ### Chat

      For multi-turn conversations, use the `chats` service to maintain conversation history.

      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client()
      chat = client.chats.create(model="gemini-2.5-flash")

      response = chat.send_message("I have 2 dogs in my house.")
      print(response.text)

      response = chat.send_message("How many paws are in my house?")
      print(response.text)

      for message in chat.get_history():
          print(f'role - {message.role}',end=": ")
          print(message.parts[0].text)
      ```

      ### Structured outputs

      Use structured outputs to force the model to return a response that conforms to a specific Pydantic schema.

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types
      from pydantic import BaseModel

      client = genai.Client()

      # Define the desired output structure using Pydantic
      class Recipe(BaseModel):
          recipe_name: str
          description: str
          ingredients: list[str]
          steps: list[str]

      # Request the model to populate the schema
      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model='gemini-2.5-flash',
          contents="Provide a classic recipe for chocolate chip cookies.",
          config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
              response_mime_type="application/json",
              response_schema=Recipe,
          ),
      )

      # The response.text will be a valid JSON string matching the Recipe schema
      print(response.text)
      ```

      ### Function Calling (Tools)

      You can provide the model with tools (functions) it can use to bring in external information to answer a question or act on a request outside the model.

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types

      client = genai.Client()

      # Define a function that the model can call (to access external information)
      def get_current_weather(city: str) -> str:
          """Returns the current weather in a given city. For this example, it's hardcoded."""
          if "boston" in city.lower():
              return "The weather in Boston is 15°C and sunny."
          else:
              return f"Weather data for {city} is not available."

      # Make the function available to the model as a tool
      response = client.models.generate_content(
        model='gemini-2.5-flash',
        contents="What is the weather like in Boston?",
        config=types.GenerateContentConfig(
            tools=[get_current_weather]
        ),
      )
      # The model may respond with a request to call the function
      if response.function_calls:
          print("Function calls requested by the model:")
          for function_call in response.function_calls:
              print(f"- Function: {function_call.name}")
              print(f"- Args: {dict(function_call.args)}")
      else:
          print("The model responded directly:")
          print(response.text)
      ```

      ### Generate Images

      Here's how to generate images using the Imagen models.

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from PIL import Image
      from io import BytesIO

      client = genai.Client()

      result = client.models.generate_images(
          model='imagen-3.0-generate-002',
          prompt="Image of a cat",
          config=dict(
              number_of_images=1, # 1 to 4
              output_mime_type="image/jpeg",
              person_generation="ALLOW_ADULT" # 'ALLOW_ALL' (but not in Europe/Mena), 'DONT_ALLOW' or 'ALLOW_ADULT'
              aspect_ratio="1:1" # "1:1", "3:4", "4:3", "9:16", or "16:9"
          )
      )

      for generated_image in result.generated_images:
         image = Image.open(BytesIO(generated_image.image.image_bytes))
      ```

      ### Generate Videos

      Here's how to generate videos using the Veo models. Usage of Veo can be costly, so after generating code for it, give user a heads up to check pricing for Veo.

      ```python
      import time
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types
      from PIL import Image

      client = genai.Client()

      PIL_image = Image.open("path/to/image.png") # Optional

      operation = client.models.generate_videos(
          model="veo-2.0-generate-001",
          prompt="Panning wide shot of a calico kitten sleeping in the sunshine",
          image = PIL_image,
          config=types.GenerateVideosConfig(
              person_generation="dont_allow",  # "dont_allow" or "allow_adult"
              aspect_ratio="16:9",  # "16:9" or "9:16"
              number_of_videos=1, # supported value is 1-4, use 1 by default
              duration_seconds=8, # supported value is 5-8
          ),
      )

      while not operation.done:
          time.sleep(20)
          operation = client.operations.get(operation)

      for n, generated_video in enumerate(operation.response.generated_videos):
          client.files.download(file=generated_video.video) # just file=, no need for path= as it doesn't save yet
          generated_video.video.save(f"video{n}.mp4")  # saves the video
      ```

      ### Search Grounding

      Google Search can be used as a tool for grounding queries that with up to date information from the web.

      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client()

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model='gemini-2.5-flash',
          contents='What was the score of the latest Olympique Lyonais' game?',
          config={"tools": [{"google_search": {}}]},
      )

      # Response
      print(f"Response:\n {response.text}")
      # Search details
      print(f"Search Query: {response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.web_search_queries}")
      # Urls used for grounding
      print(f"Search Pages: {', '.join([site.web.title for site in response.candidates[0].grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks])}")
      ```

      The output `response.text` will likely not be in JSON format, do not attempt to parse it as JSON.

      ### Content and Part Hierarchy

      While the simpler API call is often sufficient, you may run into scenarios where you need to work directly with the underlying `Content` and `Part` objects for more explicit control. These are the fundamental building blocks of the `generate_content` API.

      For instance, the following simple API call:

      ```python
      from google import genai

      client = genai.Client()

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-2.5-flash",
          contents="How does AI work?"
      )
      print(response.text)
      ```

      is effectively a shorthand for this more explicit structure:

      ```python
      from google import genai
      from google.genai import types

      client = genai.Client()

      response = client.models.generate_content(
          model="gemini-2.5-flash",
          contents=[
            types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part.from_text(text="How does AI work?")]),
          ]
      )
      print(response.text)
      ```
