Series on shame and what I we have done if you have not been here is in my mind shame is one of the most important topics to discuss with people that come out of childhood trauma it is something that happens subconsciously that they do not even realize and often are not aware of but it's a core belief that they develop that basically says the reason I am being neglected or abused or I have been abandoned and my needs are not being met consistently is it must be my fault something is wrong with me I must not be lovable I must not have any value and that core belief once it takes root and shape within the person begins to affect everything they do and when they go to get into a relationship in the future they are going to have to be able to get into a relationship with God and and then once that's in the picture it makes a healthy relationship impossible and so we spent three weeks trying to identify what shame is help you understand it help you begin to see it in your life and I hope that you have been able to do that so what I decided to do tonight was to give you a test and you do not know it but on that sheets that you were given you are going to find not the normal PowerPoint but you are going to find a test and remember if you are a person who has been signing up for a job that is not your fault.  So the question that I get asked all the time is if shame happens at a self-conscious level, I did not become aware that I had shame as my core identity until I started coming here.  How can I tell how my shame is showing itself?  How can I tell how my shame has worked itself out in my life?  So this test is 42 characteristics of shame.  And I might add a few extra to throw in for free as we go through it together.

But here's what I want you to do.  If you have a courage and you do not mind people looking over your shoulder to see what you wrote down, but I want you to, on a scale of 1 to 10, rate yourself on each question.  So we are going to go through 42.  So 1 means it's not really an issue at all.  10 means this is a massive issue.  So you can rate yourself on each question.  And then at the end, we are going to tabulate just kind of how big shame is an issue for you.  And the second thing that you can do, and this is optional as well, but you might want to do scale of 1 to 10 what I was like a year ago and a scale of 1 to 10 of what I am like today in each of those areas and see if there's been any growth in those areas in your life.  So I am going to read them out as we go.  And you can do the marking down and grade yourself.  I will explain some of them as we go to make sure everybody understands.  So are you ready?  Number 1, have a rigid core belief like I am bad, I am weak, I am unlovable, undeserving, inept, unattractive, stupid, powerless, worthless person.  Any of those, rate the information.  And if you are not, then you are going to have an intensity of that belief in your life.  Okay?  Second one, excessively zealous, defensive, rigid, dogmatic.  So a couple things with that.  If somebody says something to you, how quickly do you become defensive about stuff?  How quickly do you take things personally and then get defensive?  That's part of that.  Secondly is how much are you, it's rigid in your thinking.  You only want to look at things one way.  Do not mess with my thinking.  I do not want to see any other point of view.  It's my way or the highway.  And you have that very rigid type of thinking inside of you.  Or the third part of that is you like to take on projects.  And you go 100 miles an hour with great zeal on your latest project until you get bored.  Then you jump to the next project with great zeal and go on like that.  So that's all included in number 2.  Number 3, habitual self-centeredness and egotism.  Now it's easy to think that a self-centered person's got a big ego and is bragging all the time.  What I do to help people with that is I say, you can be very self-centered and never talk about yourself.

But if there was a group photo taken and somebody showed you the group photo, who would you look for first?  Yourself.  That's what that self-centeredness is.  Okay?  That's the kind of preoccupation that self-centeredness is about.  Number 4, constant belittling, discounting, criticizing yourself and or others.  So your negative thought world is predominant.  It's kind of your default.  Number 5, repeatedly choosing menial jobs below your personal capabilities.  The other part of that is you avoid responsibilities excessively.  So the word commitment scares you to death.  Because that makes you have to be responsible.  And you do not want to have to get locked into that.  Okay?  Number 6, some of you are nudging each other already.  Having one or more active addictions to substances, including fat, sugar, carbohydrates, activities, like work, etc.  Okay?  Some of you are doing activities like work, spending, gambling, pornography, working out.  Certain relationship, codependency, emotional states like excitement, rage, anger, spiritual ecstasy, sexual arousal, or sexual release.  That's number 6.  Some of you are putting 15 instead of 10 on some of these.  And I get that.  Compulsion number 7, to rescue needy or disadvantaged people.  Number 8, championing and identifying with the underdogs.  So you are always rescuing people.  We have talked about that a lot.  Number 8, habitually avoiding eye contact or being apologetic that you do not look at people in the eye.  Or being defensive if somebody challenges you that you do not look them in the eye.  Number 9, excessive social isolation or a compulsion to socialize.

Now, all these questions are going to go to the two ends of the spectrum, the two extremes.  So the one is isolate from all social.  The other is I cannot stop being in a social environment.  And I have to be charming and the center of attention.  Number 10, having few or no real friends.

Now, we are not talking about superficial casual friends.  We are talking about real friends.  Or being consistent with others.  Or being constantly drawn to other unrecovered, wounded, needy companions and partners.  So who are you attracted to if you are attracted to people?  11, a general suspicion and mistrust of other people, even or especially when they are trying to be nice.  You suspect some hidden motive.  Number 12, excessive sensitivity and defensiveness.  So being very sensitive to perceived criticism, not necessarily real criticism, and perceived rejection.  So being very sensitive to whether people are criticizing you or rejecting you.  13, excessive concern with personal or social blame and fault finding.  So preoccupied with blame of yourself, of society, finding fault with yourself, with society.  14, often misperceiving neutral feedback as being criticism.  And or wrongly assuming unspoken criticism.  15, feeling irrationally guilty.  So you are feeling guilty but you have not done anything wrong.  Or getting anxious about earned successes.  So this is known as the imposter syndrome.  Where you feel like you are being a fraud or a phony when you are recognized for an accomplishment.  16, obsessing about my rights or I do not deserve anything.  Two ends of the spectrum.  Or obsessing about equality and fairness all the time as being one of your real hot buttons.  17, endlessly focusing on past mistakes.  That you made in public or in private.  Number 18, habitually putting your own opinions, needs, and welfare last.  Versus seeing you as equal to other people.  19, having an unreasonable fear of failing, losing, or making mistakes.  20, never admitting mistakes.  Or compulsively apologizing all the time.  So we are almost halfway done.  So if you are starting to see maybe you have some shame, good.  That was the purpose of this test.  21, habitually unflattering, inappropriate, and or sloppy clothing, grooming, or hygiene.  In other words, you dress like a tramp because you feel like a tramp.  22, obsessive concern with personal, professional, social, vehicle, or dwelling appearances.  The other extreme, preoccupied with how you look and how everything that you own looks.  Image.  23, compulsive perfectionism and explaining to your friends or justifying to your friends, I just cannot help it.  24, uncivilized, unselfish, and unselfish.  25, unselfish, unselfish, and unselfish.  And then you are driven with a need to win.  24, rarely buying anything nice or special for oneself.  Or taking fun trips or vacations because you feel you are not worth it, you do not deserve it.  Or it would be a waste of good money to waste it on yourself.  25, lying directly or by admission.  So you do not say what, you just say 95% of what you did today, you admit the 5% you do not want them to know.  That's a form of lying.  26, denying it to avoid expected ridicule, criticism, or disapproval.  Also a symptom of lots of fear.  27, so the need to lie because you are afraid of how others will react if they knew the truth.  26, notable self-neglect.  Examples, resisting or avoiding appropriate medical care.  Afraid to go to the doctor because you are afraid of what you might find out.  Okay, rarely or never seeing a doctor, a dentist, gynecologist, eye specialist for checkups or illnesses.  Not getting or taking medications that are prescribed, poor personal hygiene.  27, avoiding self-assessment for psychological wounds and or true personal recovery.  Living by the thing that says that's in the past, I am not going to look at it.  It does not affect me now, I refuse to look at how any of that might have affected me.  Avoidance of looking at that stuff that might be painful.  28, choosing unhealthy diets or habits, including smoking.  Lack of exercise and or putting yourself into toxic environments.  Ignoring, deflecting, minimizing, explaining, analyzing, or joking about this.  So you go, yes, I got lots of unhealthy habits.  Yes, I go out with unhealthy people.  I hang around and then you make a joke about why it's not a big deal.  29, deflecting, discounting, and or rejecting deserved compliments.  Being very hard on yourself.  So if people give you a compliment, you have some way of deflecting it so you do not absorb it.  30, chronically giving time and energy to others and getting little or nothing in return.  So you give more than you get as you are normal in relationships.  31.  Repeatedly choosing, justifying, and tolerating relationships, situations, and environments which promote or produce shame in you.  So letting yourself stay in a relationship where it feeds into your shame.  Letting yourself being in environments that cause you greater shame and doing nothing about it.  32.  Being unable to do this exercise.  Going, this is stupid.  Okay, some of you just put 10 by that one.  33.  You did not know that we would sneak that one in there.  Repeatedly taking risks that result in self-harm, humiliation, and or loss of self and social respect.  33.  Being able to do this, even if it's not the most important thing in your life.  So being able to be a little bit more while you are doing it.  34.  Hiding or justifying an act of addiction is a common example.  So you are not purposely killing yourself, but you are flirting with all kinds of dangerous stuff and somehow justifying it to yourself and others.  35.  Rarely requesting or demanding what you want.  Or doing so anxiously and expecting rejection.  You need.  So to ask for help, to express a need or desire causes anxiety in you and you resist doing that.  35, tolerating and or justifying a core belief like I do not deserve or expect success, love, security, comfort, friends, or nice things.  Or another way to say that is I think the best I will do is to get a few crumbs of love and I am okay with that.  36, we are almost done if you are sweating.  Being timid, passive, quiet, reserved, or aggressive, self-centered, and a bully.  Two ends of that extreme.  37, not setting or enforcing holistically healthy limits or boundaries and not setting or enforcing holistically healthy limits or boundaries and not setting or enforcing with oneself and others.  So you are not good at setting boundaries.  You are not good at making rules for yourself and then following those rules.  You are great at making rules.  It's just following them.  That's the problem.  38, self-sabotage, repeatedly setting yourself up for failure, disappointment, frustration, losses, and feeling or saying I cannot help it.  It does not matter.  I do not care.  I do not deserve it.  So you sabotage all the good things that are happening in your life.  39, frequently choosing long-suffering victim, saint, or martyr roles in key relationships and social settings and not questioning why.  In other words, if you start looking at your relationships, you begin to realize why am I always the victim and why am I always the one that's making all the sacrifices?  And then you never question yourself.  You just keep.  Repeating that cycle, relationship after relationship.  40, choosing a direct contact human service profession like clergy, being a pastor, counseling, medicine, being a doctor, education, being a teacher, law enforcement, being a cop or probation or corrections, consulting, coaching, training, driver vehicle, driving public vehicles, customer service, casework.  So you always need to be in a helping role.  41, shame anxiety.  The fear of feeling shame.  So not only do you know you have shame, you are afraid when you go to different situations that your shame might get triggered.  And that causes you anxiety.  And 42, frequently reliving traumatic memories from the past that cause shame.  How did you do?  Okay.  So here's now what I want to do.  I want you to do.  Go through and count the number that you have a score of 7 or higher.  And see how many of the 42 you end up with a score of 7 or higher.  I just did this with the clients at React a couple weeks ago and we did not do all 42.  We just did 38 of them.  And most of them had more than 30.  And we had 30 that were 7 and above.  So see what you have.  And if you are in that category, you better sign up for React.  Okay.  Now I want to tell you this.  Next week and the week after are going to be the final two weeks on shame.  And it's all going to be positive.  It's going to be healing shame.  Okay.  This is the last heavy night.  And this is the last night where you get a punch in the face.  About this is an issue.  Pay attention.  Start to work on it.  Because this is a big problem.  And maybe now you are beginning to see that.  So with that, you can take that home.  You can think about it.  Talk about it.  Get an application for React over there if you want.

But I want to take you to the next piece with this, which I think is super important to understand.  And it goes like this.  Shame is a core belief.

But what I want you to understand is all the beliefs that shame develops are lies.  So a big part of dealing with shame is understanding the lies that you have believed that are part of shame.  So the obvious ones we have talked about.  I am not good enough.  I am less than.  I am not lovable.  I am not valuable.  I am inferior.  I am a bad person.  I am not good enough.  I am not bad.  So we have talked about those.  Now what I want you to do is think with me a little bit further into other more subtle lies that come out of shame.

But then that your brain has developed systems to protect those lies from ever changing.  So let me give you this.  We have talked about the house of mirrors.  So if you went into the Red River X with the distorted mirrors and you are six feet tall and thin, but you look in the mirror and you are four feet tall and four feet tall, and you are four feet wide, that's a distorted mirror.  That mirror is lying to you.

But if you grew up in a family where you only had one mirror and it was distorted, and that's the mirror you looked at every day, and it was mom and dad, what they said, how they treated you, and you believed that you were four feet tall and four feet wide, and then in your teens you went for the first time to a friend's house where they had an accurate mirror, and you looked in it and you were six feet tall and four feet wide, and you were thin, you would say something's wrong with that mirror.  So what I want you to understand is you believe the lie of the distorted mirror as if it's the truth, but you built a layer of protection around that so that now when you see an accurate mirror, something kicks in and says that's not right and you discount it.  You do not allow it to penetrate the lie.  So what would happen if somebody came up to you and say, I see so much growth in you, I see potential, I see great qualities in you.  A lot of you would go, they would not say that if they really knew me.  So you just have a system right there where you just discounted any chance to change the lie that I am not good enough.  Or you might say, I wonder what they want.  They must have some hidden secret.  They have a hidden agenda here.  They are trying to get something from me.  That's why they are buttering me up.  And you would discount what they say through all kinds of different things.  So the point I want you to see is this.  When you come to deal with shame, you are confronting lies, but it's not easy to confront those lies.  There are systems in place to keep you hanging onto the lies as if they are the truth.  So we are going to come at the very end of tonight to how we begin to change that.

But I want you to think about some of the extra lies that come out of shame.  So some of you feel that you are a phony.  And what makes that difficult is there's a part of you that has been a phony.  You have worn masks.

But you want to believe that all of you is phony.  And that's part of a lie.  Some of you have been trained to believe, I am selfish.  If I ever express a need or stand up for myself or take care of myself, I am being selfish.  And you go there very quickly.  Some of you have the lie that you are ugly.  And that is part of your shame lie.  Some it goes even deeper.  And they at some level, probably not even at a conscious level, believe I should not have been born.  And you may have heard things like that growing up.  And you have bought into that.  Or with that, I do not deserve a good life.  And that is one of the reasons why people sabotage when good things start to happen.  Because deep, deep down, they do not believe they deserve it.  Another lie that suddenly comes out of all of this is, I figure because I am such a screw up, I will eventually fail at everything in my life.

Therefore, I might as well mess it up now.  And that's part of the sabotage.

But I want you to see the subtlety of that shame lie is, I am pretty sure I will fail at everything.  So I might as well get it over with.  Next one.  And this now goes into a street level of shame.  A street level of thinking, but it's how shame distorts respect.  So if you criticize me in any way, you are rejecting me.  Or you think I am worse than you.  If you question my ideas, you think I am stupid.  So what does it mean to show respect on a street level?  You have to agree with me about everything I say.  You can never challenge me.  You can never criticize me.  If you do, you are disrespecting me.  If you ever offer me advice or challenge something that I have said and offer me a better solution, you are disrespecting me.  That is shame.  And shame is believing, the only way I can believe I have value is if everybody around me are yes men.  They agree with everything I do, they never confront me, never hold me accountable.  If they do, then they are disrespecting me.  Next one, and this is a very subtle one too.  People who are nice to me are probably saying bad things behind my back.  Some of you may deep down believe that.  Next one.  Deep down, I think that everyone I get close to will eventually abandon me.  Maybe not right away, but eventually they will.  Next one.  I will sometimes abandon people because I am pretty sure they abandoned me.  This can happen at a subconscious level where if you feel relationship tension or distance growing, you may begin without even realizing it, start sabotaging the relationship and abandoning the other person before they abandon you.  And that is part of the shame lie and how it works out.  Next one.  If I spend time relaxing or doing something that interests me, I am being selfish.  So some of you were raised that in such a way that if you relax, you feel guilty.  If you take an afternoon off just to do stuff you enjoy, you are being selfish and you feel guilty for that.  Next one, very subtle.  No one will ever love me unconditionally.  People may love me, but there's usually always a string attached somewhere.  And that comes out of shame.  And so you are suspicious of all love and cannot allow yourself to receive it because you cannot believe it would ever be genuine.  Next one.  I should be happy with a relationship that gives me a few crumbs of love that's probably the best I can get.  Again, shame working itself out.
