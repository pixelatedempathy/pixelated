So what the brain does...

The brain then does is prepare itself to freeze.

And what that means is the brain prepares itself to get hurt.

And this is so interesting to understand.

Because if a child can't fight or flight, it must freeze.

The brain then releases opioids, its own opioids in the system to prepare it to get hurt.

So the brain then does...

It does that to prepare itself to get hurt.

So it won't feel it so badly.

But also what happens is the brain slows the heartbeat down.

In fight or flight, cortisol sped the heartbeat up.

But now on freeze, it slows it down, preparing it to get hurt.

The child retreats into itself.

It doesn't flee outwardly.

It flees inwardly.

Into its own fantasy.

And the child goes to people pleasing.

I'll do whatever you want.

Just don't be angry.

Don't hurt me.

And so that happens because of complex trauma.

So the only way then to regulate the emotions if it can't fight or flight and resolve it is let's release opioids to calm the child down.

Let's dissociate.

That'll regulate the child.

Let's people please.

That'll regulate the situation.

So it's still about regulation.

So what happens when they get to adult life and there's still nobody in their life that cares that's helping them and they're dysregulated?

They need to release opioids in their body.

And so people will bang their heads against the wall.

They will cut.

That will release opioids in their body.

They will burn themselves and that brings back the regulating feelings again.

Or they find drugs and alcohol.

They find opioid chemicals out there.

And those help them feel regulated again.

So complex trauma sets people up for cutting, burning their own opioid system, for drugs, synthetic opioid systems.

All to help them regulate.

So let's move on to healing.

There's some very important healing phases.

And we've talked about this in other talks in a lot of detail.

But let me just quickly go through some of the phases.

So the first phase and the first tool is I need tools to help regulate my brain stem and limbic brain when they're dysregulated.

So I need tools to help regulate my brain stem and limbic brain when they're dysregulated.

All Googles, Google Search for iterate skill, here's how you can teach people to regulate their own brain stem and limbic brain when thereρω bölalam So I among you need tools that help regulate center其 I друзья can use tools that heal potentially heal a person's organs and mental faculties Hayman Gyalis Yel renewable approach, yet another way.

To provide mental consciousness.

If I had gotten students duringявκ And I would not have tech help to relieve so many people out there with hypoth 되면 Clint Rosenz Afrikum prolifer nominations There's a sensor or finding what has any I've been told what is a approved version of Office control onto a computer or based Rhythms that help regulate them.

So what I want you to understand is the starting point for dealing with emotional regulation is not tools for the cortex because it's not yet engaged.

It's tools to ground, to de-escalate the limbic system.

And rhythm is a big part of that.

Then once regulated, you can go to the cortex.

And as you go to the cortex, then you can tell time again.

And you go, you know what?

What just happened felt like 40 years ago, but I'm not there 40 years ago, even though it feels like it's still happening to me.

And so then you can go, okay, what happened here?

And you can reprocess the event and reprocess the trauma and learn from it.

And healing will happen as you do that.

Then the third.

Is you don't want to just be living with grounding tools for when you're triggered.

What you want to do is start healing your stress system so that it isn't triggered as much so that it gets to a healthier place that can better handle stress and triggering events.

And so what are tools to help develop an increasingly healthy stress response system?

Yoga.

For many people does that running pet therapy, art therapy, all are helpful.

But more than that, you have to begin to learn to meet your 12 needs consistently.

And you have to begin connecting with safe people.

Again, the three ingredients now have to become part of your life.

Not just when you're in a crisis.

Then the fourth thing is you have to go back and heal.

And those wounds won't heal unless you talk about them, face them, get honest about them.

Bring them to your conscious level.

As long as you avoid, as long as you try to stuff them down, deny them, say it doesn't bother me.

Those wounds are going to keep bleeding into your life today.

And then finally develop a mindfulness.

And there's a couple of things we mean by mindfulness.

There's a couple of things we mean by that.

First of all, develop an inventory time a couple times a day where you go, how am I doing stress-wise?

Where's my head at?

What's my mental health?

What are the main emotions I'm feeling right now?

So you keep track of if the stress is building, if your head space is still good.

So develop those inventories.

And then...

If you go, my head space isn't good, what do I need to do about it?

If my stress is building, what do I need to do about it?

And then you go to curiosity.

So when you find yourself triggered, you go, what was that about?

So instead of getting down on yourself that you were triggered, and you went back to some maybe some old behaviors, you go, okay, what's going on here?

Oh, that's connected to that.

Now I know what I need to do.

So understand this.

Attempt.

And the trigger today points to an unhealed wound from the past.

A trigger is actually a sign on the road with an arrow that says you need to go here and do some work and some healing.

And so develop that curiosity about yourself, about what's happening.

What's this trigger all about?

And you can learn and grow from it.

Let me end by just saying this.

Dr.

Bruce Perry went to New Zealand and met with the Maori indigenous people.

And they wanted him as a consultant to talk about healing methods for trauma and just healing in general.

After he spent a week with them, they talked to him and what they said to him was so impactful for him.

And it validates and reinforces so much of what I teach.

But what they said to him was this.

You guys in the West, you have developed two things so well.

You can diagnose illnesses.

You can diagnose mental health problems.

You've got it all categorized.

Depression, anxiety, ADHD, ODD, heart disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, cancer.

And then you've got the medications for all of that stuff.

You guys have done great in that and we are so appreciative.

But we think you are missing the key foundational ingredient for healing.

It's not correct diagnosis and medication, though those are important.

The foundational thing that is necessary for healing is connection.

And you in the West are a nation that is not connected.

Connection is not connected very well.

Connection is not your strong point.

So even though you have all these other things but don't have connection, you're missing the key ingredient.

And I thought, wow, that is so beautiful.

So true.

We have to start with connection to safe, healthy people.

And we talk about that all the time.

Well, that's the end of part one.

We're going to take a short break.

And I'll come back and we'll do the Christian part.

And if you're not interested in that, not a big deal.

We're not offended at all.

You're free to go.

And for everybody else, we'll be back in a minute.

We'll be right back.

Well, welcome back.

We've been looking at the life of Peter.

And we're going to talk about the life of Peter.

And we're getting later in his life now.

And what I want to talk about today is a role that Peter had to develop as kind of one of the main leaders in the church.

A role that was absolutely essential if he was going to be an effective leader.

And that was he had to become an encourager to others.

He had to mentor others in a very encouraging, supportive way.

And so I want to look at Peter's relationship to a guy we know as Mark or John Mark.

He wrote the second gospel in the New Testament part of the Bible.

And so in 1 Peter, Peter is writing a letter.

And he says, your sister church here in Babylon, and probably referring to Rome, it was a coded way of saying that, sends you greetings.

And so does my son.

Mark.

Now it's not his literal son.

But Peter is saying he's become like a son.

So let me tell you a little bit about this John Mark.

Because I think it's just fascinating to me.

So if we go to Acts 12, we're going back to the beginning of the church.

Peter's the new leader of the church in Israel.

And it's growing like crazy.

Persecution starts.

Peter is arrested and put in prison.

And we're told this.

Peter finally came to his senses.

And what happens in the middle of the night, an angel comes and taps him on the shoulder and breaks kind of his handcuffs and bonds.

And he's free.

Opens the prison gates.

The guards are asleep.

And Peter walks out free.

So he releases him.

And Peter's going, is it really true?

The Lord has sent his angel.

And Peter says, I'm going to save me from Herod and from what the Jewish leaders had planned to do to me, which was probably to kill him.

When he realized this, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many were gathered for prayer.

So it seems that in this early church in Jerusalem, that John Mark's mom had a big house.

And people started meeting there for church.

And it became a center for the church.

And they were the church in that part of the world.

So John Mark meets Peter, gets to know Peter.

We don't know about their involvement at this point.

But then we go a little bit further.

And we read about Barnabas and Paul or Saul.

And they are deciding that God has called them to go outside of the Jewish world to the Gentile world and tell them about Jesus.

And in Acts 12 it says, When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission to Jerusalem, they returned, taking John Mark with them.

They picked John Mark.

And they said, we're going on a journey, a missionary journey.

You are a young man that just seems so ripe for serving God.

Would you like to come with us?

And John Mark goes with them.

And then they just get going on their mission.

And we read in chapter 13, Paul and his companions then left.

Paphos by ship for Pamphylia, landing at the port town of Perga.

There John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem.

Now we're going to see in just a minute that Paul was not happy about this.

And so we don't know why John Mark left.

It's very possible that where they were when John Mark left, they were just going to head up into some mountains to get to the next area.

And those mountains were not the same as they were when John Mark left.

And those mountains were not the same as they were when John Mark left.

Another example, John Mark was notorious for being full of bandits, criminals, who attacked and robbed people.

Another example, John Mark was notorious for being full of bandits, criminals, who attacked and robbed people.

Also, that was an area that was known for malaria.

And so a lot of people got sick if they took that road to those churches.

And so if that was the case that John Mark might have just become afraid.

And so a lot of people got sick if they took that road to those churches.

And so if that was the case that John Mark might have just become afraid.

I don't want to take that risk.

That's too dangerous for me.

I'm going home.

It's possible.

It's possible.

But he leaves.

Now imagine, he knows he's there.

But he leaves.

imagine he knows that Paul's upset with him.

So as he walks home, I imagine he's feeling, Paul probably is really disappointed in me.

I've really let them down.

And he's feeling some guilt.

And then I think he's saying, Paul was all about willingness to make sacrifices for God so that people would come to know God.

And I chickened out.

I didn't make sacrifices.

What does that say about me?

And he's, you can imagine, he's just full of doubt and second guessing himself and inner turmoil.

And did I make the right decision?

There's guilt.

There's all kinds of confusion going on inside of him.

So then we come to Acts 15.

Paul and Barnabas have gone on their first journey and come back.

Now they're getting ready to go on a second journey.

And it says, After some time, Paul said to Barnabas, let's go back and visit each city where we previously preached to see how they're doing.

Let's go back to the churches we planted and just check up on them and encourage them.

Barnabas agreed and wanted to take along John Mark.

But Paul disagreed strongly.

Since John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in their work.

And Barnabas was so sharp that they separated.

They split.

They had a big fight.

And Paul said, I'm going my way.

Barnabas says, I'm going my way.

Barnabas took John Mark with him and sailed for Cyprus.

Can you imagine how John Mark must have felt after seeing these two men who were very powerful, significant leaders, men that he respected and really wanted them to be proud of him?

They're fighting over him.

And Paul, considered to be probably at that point, one of the greatest leaders in the church and the world, did not want John Mark on his team.

He saw John Mark as a failure.

He saw John Mark as somebody who had let him down and God down and didn't deserve another chance.

I can imagine that just happened.

And he was so proud of him.

And he was so proud of him.

And so he just must have tore Mark apart.

And I wonder if he was starting to wonder, have I lost my chance to ever serve God again?

Is the word going to get out now that Paul does not want me, and if Paul doesn't want me, then probably everybody else says, well, we don't want him either.

Because if Paul sees him as a loser, then we better not take him on.

And so I went through this very depressing time, this grieving time, this confusing time.

But then, just imagine he gets a phone call from Peter, and Peter probably just showed up.

But Peter says to him, I just heard what happened with you, Barnabas and Paul.

And you know, when I heard what happened to you, and why Paul responded the way he did, it reminded me of my story.

You see, you failed Paul.

I failed Jesus greatly.

I walked away from Jesus at the time of his greatest need.

I denied that I even knew him.

And I thought I had failed too greatly, and I thought God would never want to use me again.

But Mark, understand this.

How great leaders respond to you does not necessarily mean that's how God feels about you.

Don't base your perception of self just on what other people say.

Look at what God says about you.

And God took me after my failure, and taught me through that, and made me the leader I am today.

I think he wants to do that with you as well.

So I would like you on my team.

I would like you to work with me.

And Peter takes him under his wing and mentors him.

And do you want to know what happened?

This young man who felt like such a failure, felt like he had blown his chances, gets to this place with Peter where he's mentored, and then he writes the story of Jesus.

What's interesting about Mark's Gospel is that we read in Mark's Gospel stuff about Peter that isn't mentioned in any other Gospels.

So that's why we go, Mark's Gospel is basically Peter's story that Peter shared with Mark over the years, and Mark wrote it down.

But guess how many people Mark's Gospel has impacted in the world.

Millions and millions of people have been impacted by this story.

impacted by the writing of a man who failed miserably but who had a Peter who had also failed miserably but had been forgiven and restored and grew from it and he came and he helped Mark know that he was forgiven and restored him and mentored him and he became greatly effective for God that is the possibility for everyone who fails others might reject you and see you as a write-off but that doesn't mean God has and God can still use you let's pray father I just thank you for this beautiful story of Peter's heart after his own failure for others who had failed and his ability to give them courage and to nurture them and see them become effective for you and I pray you'd encourage anyone listening if they're going through failure to know that they're loved and can be forgiven amen well that's the end of our evening thank you again for being here
