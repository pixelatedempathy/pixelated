 Well, welcome to another Friday night. We are looking at a more in-depth study of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  Today, we come to one that I think is just very significant. It's wanting to hope, but afraid to hope.  And I find this as such an important one for people to understand as they begin their journey in recovery.  So let me begin with what a quote from somebody that says this,  hopelessness is the culmination of the many negative expectation a person has toward himself and his future.  Additionally, it is a strong predictor of suicide. Both hopelessness and suicide have a close association with mental disorders, particularly depression.  However, depression usually causes negative expectations of the present, while hopelessness causes negative expectations of the future.  So it's really hope in light of the feelings of hopelessness. One way to define hopelessness, which is what many from complex trauma experience at some time or another,  is it's a belief that the negative circumstances that I am now in will stay that way forever.  And so because of that, they go, what's the point? I might as well give up. There's nothing I can do to improve my situation.  My repeated best efforts, talking to people, exploring different options, hard work, trying all kinds of different approaches each one has resulted in failure.  So I guess there's nothing more I can do. It's hopeless.  And we're going to develop how that develops in complex trauma. But let me just talk a little bit about hope because I think it's such an important comparison point when we look at hopelessness.  So hope by definition is the hope that things will improve that if I do the right things, my future will be better than maybe it is now.  I have to understand that hope is not just wishful thinking, it's not a passive experience in wishing about a fantasy where I hope that, okay, I'll just sit here on the couch and hope that good things happen.  No hope is actually active.  It takes your situation and goes, how do I make this better and it sets goals? It thinks through options. It weighs out what it will take.  And even though it knows it's going to be hard work or rough going, it comes up with a plan that then that then gives hope to the person because they go, yes, hard work, but it's doable.  And so it's a very active approach to life. So it's important to understand that because for a lot of people hope is just wishful thinking. It's kind of a delusional thing where you deny how bad your life is and just go, la, la, la, everything's great and everything's going to get better and they live in a bit of a fantasy world.  And ignore all the challenges that are present at that point, but that's not hope at all. That's delusional. So maybe it's helpful to think of it this way.  The difference between realistic hope and unrealistic hope, because many when they think of hope, think in terms of unrealistic hope.  But realistic hope starts with an analytical process where you look at the situation realistically, you evaluate all of the options, you evaluate the work it's going to take, the perseverance is going to take, you have realistic expectations and light of your own vulnerabilities and weaknesses and supports.  And so then you come up with a plan based on that, that's realistic. And that plan because it's realistic gives hope, genuine hope.  And so it's looking at what can be changed and what can be changed. And based on that, I will focus on what can be changed and come up with a plan.  Unrealistic hope is just this fantasy wishful thinking, but it sets you up to fail.  It sets you up to become disillusioned to go into despair to have all kinds of negative feelings. And you can have this very fantasy unrealistic plan and you can put tons of energy into trying to make it happen.  Because it's not realistic, eventually you end up feeling even more hopeless. So unrealistic hope only it gives kind of limbic brain satisfaction right now, but it because it's not realistic, it leads to failure, greater sense of hopelessness, lots of negative emotions, anger, disappointment, frustration, etc.  So we're talking about realistic hope. Now let me go back to this hopelessness because that's really the focus that I want to have in light of complex trauma.  Somebody has said there's five types of hopelessness and I thought this was helpful. So the first type is feeling alienated.  So as much as you try to fit in at home with peer groups, etc. You just don't fit in anywhere regardless of what you do, you feel totally alone, rejected, alienated, and there's a hopelessness that goes with that kind of alienation and many of you have experienced that.  Then there's abandonment hopelessness. You try to connect, but nobody's there for you. Nobody seems to want to be in your corner fighting for you. Nobody is supporting you. And so you're facing this big bad world all alone.  And that is such a haunting feeling. It brings such a hopelessness because you know you're too small, too weak to face the world alone.  And then there's what's some call uninspired hopelessness and this is a person who wants to have a better life.  So let's picture somebody that grows up in the hood. There's gangs, there's violence, there's poverty, there's racial prejudice all around them.  The only jobs available are in drugs and prostitution. And it's just a very bleak situation, but this kid wants to get better.  But as hard as he tries, he can't find any opportunities to get a good job. He doesn't have any positive role models. He doesn't have anybody supporting him encouraging him.  And he's the wrong skin color. So no matter what he tries to do to improve his life, there's just no options that's workable.  And so he just comes to this place of hopelessness.  The fourth one is helpless hopelessness. And that's a young person, let's say a child in a family that's abusive and they want to change the family.  They want all the fighting to stop, all the hurt to stop, but they're too little, they're not strong. And so they feel a helplessness to make choices that they can put into action because they're too small.  And so their helplessness leads to hopelessness. And again, many of you have experienced that.  And then oppression. And that's a person you can picture a slave, you can picture somebody who's being trafficked in the human trafficking trade.  They have these powerful people around them who are pimping them out, holding them hostage.  They're in this prison that they cannot escape, no matter how hard they try. And it leads to this feeling of haunting hopelessness.  So I thought that was helpful just because it gives you a perspective on different types of hopelessness where they can come from.  And some of you have experienced all five.  Now let me switch back to hope again. I want to talk about the importance of hope in our lives, because many of you have lived in hopelessness for so many years.  It's hard to remember sometimes what's the point of even hoping because for you, that's a dangerous place to go.  So hope research tells us that a person who has hope is better able to manage stress, anxiety, and deal with adversity or frustrating circumstances.  A person who's hopeless when they hit adversity, it just makes them more depressed.  But hope gives you a sense of optimism so that when you face all of these difficult situations, you're able to handle it better.  And so what they see then is hope is a necessary thing if a person wants to experience true happiness and a sense of well-being.  A person who feels hopeless is not a happy person, is not a person who knows joy and contentment.  The next thing they found is that hope is a healer.  So you can't heal very well if at all in some cases without hope that the medicine will work, that the therapy will work.  That's something that you do will make a difference.  If you have no hope, you're either not going to try it or you go in with such a negative mindset that it sets you up to fail.  And so if you want to heal, hope is necessary and hope enables healing.  Then you see that hope enables positive action.  So people who are hopeful don't go down into old destructive behaviors.  They take action. And as they take action, they see positive changes.  And those positive changes have a ripple effect. It gives more hope.  And it gets them to set more goals and know that they can make a difference.  That they can have positive results and it starts to feed off each other in a positive way.  And so that means then that people with hope are more likely to make positive choices for themselves.  They are likely to eat better. They are likely to exercise more.  They are likely to take care of themselves.  They are likely to fulfill responsibilities, invest in relationships because they see a future.  Whereas hopelessness leads to the sense of isolation and let's just start shutting everything down because nothing makes a difference.  So hope is necessary for growth, for healing, for positive changes in your life.  And then hope leads to other positive emotions.  It leads to joy, it leads to courage, to confidence.  And it starts defeating some of the negative emotions that have been there.  The discontent, the pessimism, the negativity, all of that begins to get defeated by it.  And then the other thing that is so important is hopelessness leads to a type of distorted thinking where you believe a lot of lies.  But when you have hope, you're able to catch those distortions, you're able to catch the lies that you're believing and stop them.  And so hope has a positive effect on my thought life, which is so important in recovery.  So what I hope you see is that hope affects every part of who we are in a positive way.  And it is a necessary attitude as one begins the journey of recovery.  And let me flip back to hopelessness.  There's a test that is used to ascertain a person's sense of hopelessness, often used in considering whether a person is suicidal.  It's called the Beck, Beck helplessness scale.  And so let me go through the questions and just a true or false answer.  And you can mark down the ones that are true for you.  Number one, I look forward to the future with hope and enthusiasm.  Two, I might as well give up because there's nothing I can do to make things better for myself.  Three, when things are going badly, I am helped by knowing that they can't stay that way forever.  Four, I can't imagine what my life would be like in ten years.  And that's because you're not thinking ten years ahead.  Five, I have enough time to accomplish the things I most want to do.  Six, in the future I expect to succeed in what concerns me most.  Seven, my future seems dark to me.  Eight, I happen to be particularly lucky and I expect to get more of the good things in life than the average person.  Nine, I just don't get the breaks and there's no reason to believe that I will in the future.  Ten, my past experiences have prepared me well for the future.  Eleven, all I can see ahead of me is unpleasantness rather than pleasantness.  Twelve, I don't expect to get what I want, really want.  Thirteen, when I look ahead to the future I expect that I will be happier than I am now.  Fourteen, things just don't work out the way I want them to.  Fifteen, I have great faith in the future.  Seventeen, I never get what I want so it's foolish to want anything.  It is very unlikely that I will get any real satisfaction in the future.  Nineteen, the future seems vague and uncertain to me.  Sorry, nineteen.  I can look forward to more good times than bad times.  And twenty, there's no use in really trying to get something I want because I probably won't get it.  So how did you do?  For some of you you might have got a number of those true.  If you did I really hope you can reach out for some help.  Now I want to bring in this whole complex trauma piece and how it affects hope and leads to hopelessness.  So a child and we've talked about this many times in the past, we all are born with what we call these twelve needs.  So their physical needs, emotional needs, intellectual needs, relational needs, spiritual needs.  And what a person gets those twelve needs consistently met in their life, that would be a healthy childhood.  That would be a childhood that feels a certain contentment and joy.  But what happens in complex trauma is those twelve needs aren't consistently met.  And that's why the child feels in danger.  So what I want you to see though is that when a child comes into the world, not only do they have the twelve needs,  they also have the hope that those needs will be met.  And they see their parents as the ones who will meet those needs.  So a child comes into the world with twelve needs but with a hope in their parents to take care of them, to meet those needs.  The parents are the only ones they're looking to to meet those twelve needs.  So hope then is connected to trust.  So a child comes into the world with a natural trust and hope in his parents to meet his needs.  So then what happens when a child's need is not met.  So they experience hurt, pain, negative emotions.  But they usually conclude that it's because they did something wrong.  They don't think it's connected to their parents having done something wrong.  So the child comes into the world thinking that the parents will consistently love them.  And if their needs aren't met, it's their fault.  And so then what the brain does is it begins looking for solutions.  It tries to figure out what the child should have done differently in order to get that need met.  And so it tries option A.  Well, needs still not met.  Option B.  Need still not met.  Option C.  And the brain will keep trying option option option.  And as soon as it comes up with a new option, hope is reborn.  Because then it goes, okay, maybe this will work.  And so as long as the brain can keep coming up with options,  there's going to be hope of getting that need met.  Hope will stay alive.  But when it finally gets to the point where it concludes it has tried every option available,  but that need still has not been met, then hope dies.  The brain gives up.  It feels helpless to change the situation, but it also feels hopeless.  And in my years of working with people from complex trauma,  for many of them, that hope died somewhere between 10 and 13 years old.  That's when the brain finally gave up trying to get their mom or dad to love them, validate them, connect with them,  encourage them, accept them, and hope died.  Now there's another important piece to understand and thinking about this.  When we talk about addiction, we often talk about drugs or alcohol that give consistent results  and then things that give inconsistent results or inconsistent rewards.  So take, for example, gambling.  Sometimes you get the jackpot, many times you don't.  But the times you don't, your brain says, but we've won in the past,  so if we just keep trying, surely we'll win this time.  And so hope stays alive longer if there has been inconsistent reward along the journey.  And that's why the hope doesn't die till 10 to 13  because sometimes the parents have seen to meet the needs.  And that has caused hope to be reborn and even become more optimistic.  And so because of the inconsistent reward in getting their needs met,  hope continues longer than it would have if hope just never,  if there was always consistent negative rewards.  So let me show what happens with this graph.  So a child is in a home where dad has a vicious temper,  and every once in a while dad hits and beats the child up.  So at the bottom of the graph, the child has just been beaten up.  The brain concludes, it's my fault.  So it looks for ways to get dad to stop beating the child and to treat the child nicely.  So the child says, I am going to do extra chores around the house.  He does that, and he goes for a week, two weeks, doesn't get hit.  Dad's even nice to him at times, and hope starts to be reborn.  And it goes on for a month, and he's really, really hopeful.  Okay, finally, I found this solution, and then dad gets angry and beats him up.  Hope crashes.  Brain says, must be my fault.  Okay, what do I need to do?  Okay, I will just be around dad less, so I'm not a pain.  I'll play outside more, or I'll play quietly in my room.  And that seems to be working.  Dad is kind to him.  Dad doesn't hit him, and hope is reborn.  And it gets several weeks in again, and then dad hits him and hope crashes.  Now there's two things that are happening here.  Number one, when dad hits them, there's the pain of physical abuse of rejection,  the emotional abuse that one feels.  That's pain number one, but there's a second pain, and that is that the hope's got dashed.  Both pains are very painful, but I want you to see there's two pains there.  Now let's say this child has done this for years, trying to get dad to stop hitting them,  and because there's been inconsistent rewards and what they've done,  they've done it year after year, trying new solution after new solution,  and what I want you to see is it takes a long time to knock hope out of a child.  But finally, the child gets to a point where the brain says,  I've tried everything, dad is just mean.  It doesn't matter what I do, I will get hit.  So hope dies.  But then notice what happens next.  Things are peaceful in the household.  Dad isn't mean. Dad doesn't hit him.  And the instinct inside is to start getting hopes up.  But the brains just don't go there.  Don't get your hopes up because if you get hit again, not only do you get hit your hopes get dashed,  and that hurts just as much.  So let's not get our hopes up again.  Let's sabotage this nice, pleasant time with dad.  Start pushing dad's buttons and get the hitting over with.  And so now you see within the child they want to hope but they're afraid to hope.  And that causes them to sabotage good things in their life.  And that is so important to understand when a person now comes into recovery.  So if you understand exactly what I'm talking about,  and you can pinpoint when hope died in you,  and you can also pinpoint that desire or that internal conflict between wanting to hope but being afraid to hope,  now you need to understand the things that trigger you to want to hope again and but then to sabotage it.  So you go back to hopelessness because now what your brain is saying is I must make hopelessness my default.  This must be my normal.  Getting hopes up is dangerous.  It is setting myself up to get hurt.  I can never let that happen again.  And so now your brain has built you your own prison of hopelessness.  So what are the triggers?  So important to understand how big a trigger success is.  So you're doing well in your recovery and you start to hope that maybe this time I can stay clean and sober.  Maybe this time I'll get my kids back and your brains don't get your hopes up.  This is you're going to fail.  Let's sabotage your recovery and people do that all the time.  Or you can finally find a healthy relationship.  You're getting to know each other.  There's not no fighting.  You're respecting each other.  You're trying to be there for each other.  And you're getting your hopes up that finally maybe I'm going to have a healthy relationship.  And your brain says we're not going to get her hopes up.  Let's sabotage this relationship.  So success can be a huge trigger to the fear of hope which leads to sabotage.  Other things trigger going to hopelessness very quickly.  And what I have seen in clients is the longer you have lived with hopelessness and having hopes dashed, the more quickly you go there when something bad happens.  And so for some people, they're working towards a goal.  They're all excited about their goal.  Then one little obstacle happens.  And the other one is frustration.  And their brain goes immediately to hopeless while there's no point.  I guess this isn't going to work out.  My eyes will give up.  So unless every little detail goes smoothly, the brain goes to hopelessness at the slightest frustration.  And that is so important to understand.  Another trigger is a failure.  You're doing well in recovery and then you get triggered with anger or fear and you go to an old behavior and you go, oh, I screwed it up.  I guess I can't do this.  I'm hopeless.  And you toss in your recovery.  So the slightest failure or disappointment or criticism that you might get from somebody, even if it's constructive criticism, your brain can go to hopeless.  So what I want you to understand is hopelessness is something you can go to very quickly.  And when you do, that's a very dangerous place.  That is a place where you can quickly go to old thinking or behavior.  All the old negative emotions come back.  And before you know it, you can mess up your life big time.  I want to just mention depression and hopelessness.  So when a person is coming into recovery, coming out of this total hopelessness, they're going to try to make a difference in their life.  And they do a couple positive things with new tools that they get.  And what they discover is it's working and hope is reborn.  So this positive tool leads to positive results which leads to hope and hope gradually grows day by day.  But with depression, you can use the right tool and you still feel crappy.  It doesn't seem to make a difference.  Depression causes even the right actions to still feel hopeless, to still feel dark and gloomy.  What's the point?  And so depression can keep hopelessness alive.  It can feed hopelessness in a very negative way.  What can happen in hope and depression is not only do I feel hopeless as in I've tried every possible thing to improve my life, nothing is making me feel any better.  So the only solution must be suicide.  And that's where sadly many depressed people go.  So again, if you're struggling with that, please reach out for help.  Okay, let me end with healing hopelessness.  And I hope what you see up front is there's not a quick magic fix to this.  If hopelessness has been your default setting, your normal for years, you just don't jump out of it in a day.  It's going to be a slow process.  So accept that and be patient with yourself.  First thing, piggyback on somebody else's hope.  I have people that come to me all the time who are at the end of their rope.  They wonder what's the point.  Everything they tried has failed to get recovery, to get healthy.  And they have no hope.  And what I say to them is I know that what I'm going to teach you works.  I've seen it work in thousands of lives.  So I have hope for you, not a fantasy unrealistic hope.  I have hope based on lots of evidence.  So piggyback on my hope for now until hope is reborn in you.  And then be aware that some of your hopeless feelings might be tied to depression.  And you may need some help with medication.  You may need to talk to your doctor.  Be willing or be able to go and look at that realistically.  Thirdly, reach out to somebody for help.  I remember times in my own life when depression was at its deepest darkest places where I felt totally hopeless.  And what I found is if I reached out and connected with somebody that had no love me and cared for me.  It just helped keep me going.  It gave a tiny little ray of hope.  So you're going to need to reach out.  And then start with very small achievable goals, tasks.  Don't say I'm going to have to turn my whole life around within one week.  Say, this week, I am going to work on doing this one thing every day.  It's small, it's achievable.  And as you do it, and it starts to make a difference, you get a little bit of hope.  Another ray of hope shines through.  And then I think for people who are hopeless, one of the things that is very helpful for them is to have a routine.  So get up at the same time.  Go through some self-help where you're connecting spiritually, emotionally to yourself.  And then as you do that every day, you eat well, you go to bed at the right time.  You do certain self-care activities.  That helps you.  It's like bumper bowling.  That routine kind of keeps you in the lane so that you don't go into the gutter.  So if you're listening to this, part of you is going, okay, that sounds great, but when you're feeling hopeless, who wants to do that?  And I get that.  So let me end with this.  Hopelessness is part of the limbic brain emotions.  What you need to do is get out of your limbic brain into your cortex.  But that's very difficult because when your limbic brain is feeling hopeless, it feels powerless to do anything.  It feels paralyzed.  It feels that you can't make a difference.  But do you realize that you can get out of that limbic brain into your cortex and say,  even though I feel hopeless, I can choose to do something.  I can choose to act.  Further, the limbic brain, when it's all triggered by hopelessness, it distorts reality.  It distorts your thinking.  It gives you lies.  It presents worst case scenario.  And so if you go into your cortex, you're able to say, okay, even though it feels this way and I want to believe this lie, I know it's a lie.  And so I choose not to believe this lie or distortion because here are the facts over here.  So this is, I think, the most important part of dealing with hopelessness.  It's choosing to go to your cortex, which means choosing to do something even though your limbic brain says it's useless, it's hopeless, but you do it anyways.  And as you do things, they result in positive consequences and then hope starts to be reborn.  And gradually your hope grows.  Now again, it takes time.  So be patient with yourself and be prepared that your hope can grow for a while and then it can have a setback.  Don't let that setback defeat you because that's where the hopelessness in the limbic brain says, see, didn't work.  What was the point?  Get out of the limbic brain back to your cortex and say, that's just a setback.  I'm not going to beat myself up about it.  I'm going to learn from it.  And here's what I'm going to do next time that that's different and you will again grow next into a greater place with greater hope.  So I hope that helps you.  Hopelessness is such a painful debilitating part of complex trauma.  It keeps so many people in self-destructive behaviors defeated, not willing to try.  And I just hope you will take the initial steps to make a change.  Well, that's the end of part one.  We're going to take a short break and then I'm going to come back and do part two, which is a Christian part.  If that doesn't interest you, not a problem, you're free to go. We'll see you next week.  Everybody else, I'll be back in just a minute.  Well, welcome back.  We're continuing our look into the life of Peter, one of the 12 disciples of Jesus who became one of the leaders after Jesus returned to heaven.  And we've been looking at the time in Jesus' life around his death.  And today I want to look at what Jesus' death on Calvary was like for Peter.  As far as we know, Peter wasn't at Calvary when Jesus died.  After he denied Jesus, while Jesus was on trial, Peter was in the courtyard of the building.  After he denied him three times, he took off.  And there's no record that he ever went to Calvary to watch Jesus as he was crucified.  A couple days before Jesus rose from the dead.  And so I think those were the two darkest days of Peter's life.  I don't even think I can begin to put into words the torturous soul that he experienced, the pain emotionally, spiritually that he went through.  I want to try tonight to just look at what made this so dark and painful for Peter.  And as I do it, I think many of you are going to relate because you've had those extremely dark days where your soul is tortured with pain greater than you've ever experienced before.  This will connect with you and help you, especially if you're struggling like that right now.  So the first thing I think after Peter took off and was gone for two days, and then here's that Jesus's dead was crucified.  It was brutal. I just think the guilt would have overpowered him.  He had denied with an oath saying, God, strike me dead. If I'm lying, I do not know this Jesus.  That was like saying, I don't want any part of him. If he's here, I'd spit on him.  But then he wasn't there for his best friend, his best friend who had cared so much for him.  And he wasn't there at his time, a needy fell asleep and then he fled to preserve himself.  And I think what Peter saw is that there was a dark part of him, a darkness in his soul that he had never seen before, that made him willing to ditch his best friend in order to preserve himself.  I can't imagine what it was like for Peter to just sit in those emotions.  And I expect that he wondered, will God ever forgive me? Is God done with me?  Because I just fled and let down his son. Maybe basically I'll get punished big time by God for this.  Maybe I've messed up too badly. And some of you can connect with that depth of guilt that Peter felt.  But then I think his hopes and dreams were crushed. So even talking about hope being crushed.  What was it like for Peter over the last few years, especially the last year, he had come to believe in his very soul that Jesus was the Messiah.  And so he had these amazing hopes and dreams that Jesus was going to set the world right. He was going to rule.  Peter would be employed by him, be one of his closest friends and be in a position of power next to Jesus as his right hand man.  And he was going to be part of changing the world in a wonderful way. And you can imagine the dreams that he had over and over again of what his life was going to be like.  That was all gone now. Jesus is dead. Now what? His life just hit a dead end and he can't see beyond that dead end.  What will he do now with his life? Should he go back to fishing? All of his hopes for the future were crushed.  All of his dreams were crushed. All that he thought God was leading him to do was gone.  And some of you have been there. But more, there was this uncertain future now. He didn't know what to do with his life.  He was so embarrassed that about kind of all of these dreams that were now seem like pipe dreams, foolish dreams that are crushed.  And I think you can just imagine it was a kick in the gut that was just intense to have all of those dreams crushed.  And so I think that led to a whole bunch of confusion, disillusionment.  He thought for sure he was believing the truth that Jesus was a Messiah. Had he believed a lie? Had he based his life on a lie?  Had he given his life to a fraud to the wrong thing? Had he been deceived? He didn't see himself capable of deception maybe before.  And now it's like he sees that he's just believed nothing but lies. What he thought was the foundation of his life was nothing but sand.  And this little storm has just washed his whole house away all because of lies. And then maybe he wondered if Jesus really was a Messiah, why didn't God act?  Maybe he's God is thinking wrong about God. He saw God as a loving, powerful God, the king of the universe. But if his son is dying, why didn't he step in and stop it?  Maybe he got it all wrong about God too. Maybe God isn't the God he thought he was. Maybe there isn't even a God.  And you can just feel the tortured thoughts that Peter is wrestling with as he realizes that Jesus is dead.  And so what I want you to see is Peter was going through probably emotional pain greater than many of us have been through.  You probably have been through what he's gone through, but it was intense. And it was emotional pain, but there was a spiritual pain there around God who had been the center, the foundation of his life.  Now that was up for debate. The weight of that emotional pain must have been crushing. And I sometimes wonder that people look at Peter and go, I don't think he's going to make it.  This is just going to break him too much. This is a weight that no man can carry. This is going to be the end of him.  And some of you can relate to that. Now what would happen for a person from complex trauma when they felt that kind of emotional pain?  What would they do to survive? They would close their heart. They would be consumed by anger. That would give them energy. That would keep them from feeling all of those painful emotions.  That would be their tool for survival, closed heart and anger. And some of you have gone there.  But the beautiful thing about Peter is he didn't go there. He was tempted to, I'm sure, he started to close his heart somewhat, but he didn't give in to it totally.  And he came out of this. So let me give you some lessons that I hope will be helpful to you.  What I want you to understand, first of all, is that even the greatest followers of God are not exempt from deep emotional pain, from heart wrenching, heart breaking, death of dreams, confusion, disillusionment, they're not exempt from those times.  So following God does not mean that the more you grow, the easier your life will get.  Even those closest to God go through some excruciating things. So you're not alone. And the fact that you're struggling does not mean you're bad Christian, where you're doing something wrong.  It's part of the journey. Secondly, if somebody could have seen the big picture, they would have known, Jesus died on Friday, would rise again on Sunday, they could have gone to Peter and said, Peter, you only see Friday and Saturday.  You only see the darkness. It looks hopeless, but Peter Sunday is coming. And it's going to change everything. So Peter just hang in there, hang in there for a little while longer, and all of this will end.  And I think that's the truth for all of us. When we get in those dark times of feeling hopeless, we only see Friday and Saturday.  And we need sometimes to be reminded that Sunday is coming. There will be changed for good. And then part of why Peter went through this is because he didn't understand some truth.  See, he thought Jesus would be the Messiah and become the king and set up a government and turned the world around. Jesus had tried to explain academically to Peter. That's not going to happen that way. I'm going to die.  But Peter couldn't quite hear what Jesus was saying. It didn't penetrate.  Now, I've had many people where I've tried to explain stuff academically to them about kind of what's going to happen in their life.  As they go in recovery, and I can tell they just don't get it. And finally, I have to say, okay, you're not going to really learn this truth to experience it.  And that's what happened with Peter. Jesus tried to prepare him for this. Jesus explained it, but Peter wasn't able to grasp it. And because of that, when Jesus died, he didn't wasn't able to come and say, oh, that's no big deal. He's going to rise again. No, it devastated him.  But the only way he could truly learn the resurrection was he had experienced all of that. Then his thinking changed. Then his theology changed.  So sometimes the only way we learn and grow is not just from sitting in a classroom. It's through life experience. And it's the hardest part of learning.  We don't like it because often there's a painful element, but Peter learned. And Peter came out of this experience with a new hope, and he started to change in ways that would cause him to become one of the leaders in the world.  And all of this was not wasted. All of this led to wonderful change in Peter.  I hope that helps you, especially if you're struggling right now. It's Friday and Saturday, maybe in your life. I hope you can hang on to Sunday's coming. Let's pray.  Father, thank you for this story. Thank you for the example of Peter, or sometimes as we see the things that he went through, we just are grateful that we're not alone.  And I pray for any who are struggling that you would just encourage them through Peter's life and through your faithfulness. Amen.  Well, thank you again for being here this Friday. I look forward to seeing you again next Friday. Have a great weekend.
