I want to talk tonight about an aspect of trauma that we are really beginning to understand better and a lot of research is being done on it.  And it's just how trauma affects your relationship with your body.  So most people with complex trauma find out as they get greater self-awareness is that they have a very conflicted relationship with their body.  So let me just read you a couple quotes that will set the stage for what we are going to say.  When you have an overwhelming experience, your logical mind might get over it before your body does.  In other words, people can resolve traumatic experiences often in their brain long before their body resolves it.  It still continues in their body.  The philosophical pioneer of much of trauma understanding today has said this.  For many, trauma comes back first as a reaction in your body, not a memory.  And so your brain does not even have the memory, but your body is reacting to stuff.  So trauma is not just in your head.  Trauma leaves a lasting imprint on your body.  It disrupts your memory, storage processes, and changes the way your brain works.  Trauma left untreated can have a big impact on your future health.  Trauma can lead to physical and emotional distress, which can lead to more serious health conditions such as heart attack, stroke obesity, diabetes, and cancer.  A computer that has more than one virus will have even more glitches and the same thing goes for multiple traumas.  The more adverse childhood experiences or ACEs a person has had, the more glitches are likely to occur later in life.  And then someone has said this, when trauma is particularly severe or chronic, individuals report being ungrounded, unable to identify emotions.  And we talk about that a lot, so dissociation, and disconnected from others.  The overpowering sensations of traumatic stress result in feeling unsafe in one's own body and a lack of self-agency and boundaries to prevent further trauma.  So not only do you have the past trauma that makes you feel unsafe in your body, but that trauma affected you in such a way that you do not know how to protect yourself in the future.  Individuals report feeling too much, so they are overwhelmed or activated or too little.  They are numb, withdrawn, lethargic, frozen.  The body mind states that make a somatic focus difficult and often uncomfortable.  In other words, trauma can affect your body by causing it to be over-sensitive or under-sensitive, dissociated from your body or hyper-alert to your body.  Now we have talked in the past about ongoing cortisol and how it negatively affects your brain, your immune system, but it also begins to affect all your body stuff, your organs, so diseases from stress-related stuff.  And so some of the symptoms of too much cortisol on an ongoing basis, low-energy headaches, upset stomach, including diarrhea, constipation, IBS, nausea, aches, pains, tense muscles, chest pain, and rapid heartbeat, frequent colds and infections, loss of sexual desire or ability, nervousness and shaking, ringing in the ears, cold or sweaty hands and feet, dry mouth and a hard time swallowing, insomnia, clench jaw or grinding teeth.  So let me explore a bunch of different ways that trauma can affect the body.  And we have looked at some of these in the past.  I am not going to go into that in detail.

I want to develop some of the newer research and just help you see what we are beginning to understand.  So we have talked in the past that much of complex trauma is experienced by child and infant in a preverable state.  So their brain does not have words to put to the feelings, their emotions, they cannot put words to the emotions, and so the body is not able to process all of the trauma that's happening and as a result, the brain cannot resolve it.  And so it stores the trauma in the body and it stores it as physical pain, physical sensation.  You feel it in your muscles, in your certain parts of your body, you get headaches, you get gutaches, chestaches, all kinds of different body sensations.  What we also know about trauma is this.  Trauma decreases activity in the area of the brain that is responsible for language.  So it affects how memories are stored in the brain.  So they are stored without language.  So now the memory is experienced not so much with details but as a visual memory or a visceral memory.  You feel it in the body.  The other thing that we have seen is that trauma affects your five senses and so many people with trauma are very sensitive to sound, light or touch.  So they are hypersensitive to light, to touch, to sound and that affects their sleep, that affects their ability to be in social settings.  It can have a very debilitating effect.  The other thing we have looked at regularly is trauma and its effect on dysregulation.  So that a person now is hyperaroused.  They have a startle response so that they overreact to a sound, to somebody touching them.  The flip side of that is not, they can be hypersensitive to pain, to sound, to touch, but they can also be under sensitive.  They do not feel pain.  And so now their body, they are out of touch with what is going on in their body.  So it's not just that they are dysregulated by it but they do not even feel it.  Now the one I want to start to focus on in more detail is what we call body dysmorphic disorder.  And so it's a condition in which you cannot stop thinking about one or more perceived defects or flaws in your appearance.  A flaw that appears minor or cannot even be seen by others.  You may feel so embarrassed ashamed and anxious that you may avoid many social situations.  So here's some of the signs or symptoms of body dysmorphic disorder.  So you are extremely preoccupied with perceived flaw in your appearance that to others cannot be seen or appears minor.  Secondly, you have a strong belief that you have a defect in your appearance that makes you ugly or deformed.  Or you have a belief that others take special notice of your appearance in a negative way and mock you.  Or you attempt to hide your perceived flaws with styling, makeup, or clothes.  You engage in behaviors aimed at fixing or hiding the perceived flaw that are difficult to resist or control such as frequently checking the mirror, grooming, or skin picking.  You are constantly comparing your appearance with others.  You are frequently seeking reassurance about your appearance from others.  You have perfectionist tendencies, especially relation to your appearance.  You seek cosmetic procedures but with little satisfaction and you avoid social situations.  So if you have most of those, then you probably be diagnosed with body dysmorphic disorder.  So you do not have a relationship of acceptance or being happy about your body.  What are the causes of this body dysmorphic disorder?  In this to me, it's all trauma, complex trauma-based.  So some aspect of your body, you were teased about, made fun of, or it was criticized when you were a child.  Or your family had a belief that about the body.  That there was a certain type of perfect body and your mom might have portrayed that, communicated that in all kinds of different ways.  Or that you needed a certain body type to be sexy or to be manly.  Or to be pretty.  Or you might have been taught by your religion that the body is evil.  It's a source of your problems.  And so you just hated your body because of that teaching.  Or you grew up in a very sexualized culture, and it could even be in movies.  It could be just in the way men treated you, in the way other friends treated you.

But they presented that there's a standard on how the female body should be in order to be good enough as a female.  Or sexual abuse can create this.  That you now hate your body because it gets you unwanted attention.  Or gender confusion, and this to me is very significant, is that you have always felt that you are in the wrong body.  You have the genitalia, let's say of a man, but you feel and know that you are a woman.  And so there's that gender confusion that causes you to have a relationship with your body that's discordant.  Or you are in constant chronic pain.  So you just hate your body.  Your body's a prison of pain for you.  Or you have a body that just does not function properly.  You have a chronic illness, physical handicap, and those greatly limit what you can do and cause you to hate your body.  So all of those can result in this body dysmorphic disorder.  So how do people respond often when they have this disorder to their body?  So some engage in self-harm.  They hate their body.  They are going to punish their body.  Others eating disorders.  So I do not want to be pretty, so I am going to eat.  And eating is going to take away my physical characteristics that cause me to get unwanted attention.

But what is so common and happens so often is that people become no longer present to their body.  They do not like their body.  They do not want to be in this body.  So they do not listen to their body.  They get out of touch with their body.  They disconnect from their body.  And I am going to expand on that later.  Others just do not take care of their body.  Others become a walking head.  They do not want to connect to their emotions or their body.  They just want to live in their head.  Be a thinker, be analytical, to learn, to solve everything just with academic thinking.

But then there's the flip side.  Others begin to think their body is their greatest source of value.  Others then on the flip side of that see their body as their greatest source of shame.  So you can go one extreme to another.  You hate your body.  It just causes you shame.  It feeds your shame.  Or your body is what gives you value.  And so you become constantly self conscious about your body.  You can be embarrassed about your body if it's a shame.  You wear big clothes.  You avoid shame settings.  You engage in fantasy lies that have only I had the perfect body.  It would solve everything.  It would make me likeable, popular.  It would get me respect.  And people go down that road or you have become obsessed with having the perfect body.  Now a lot of people with is important to understand here is there's a healthy part of what I am going to talk about in an unhealthy part.  So it's so important in taking care of our body to have good nutrition, to have good exercise, a good diet.

But others take it too far.  They become obsessed with nutrition, exercise, diet, they even go to plastic surgery.  And so what I want you to see is that exercise, nutrition diet, all of that is one piece of a thousand piece puzzle in becoming healthy.

But what is happening with people in with body dysmorphia is they are seeing it as the only piece of the puzzle that if they could just have perfect nutrition, perfect diet, constant exercise, they would end up with the perfect body.  That would solve all their problems.  That would take away all their trauma issues.  That would just fix everything.  So they are putting all their eggs in that one basket.  And it's really setting them up to get hurt again.  So let me go back to this disconnecting from your body.  So a term that has become very popular and but important in psychology now is disembodiment.  And it's really a type of dissociation.  So usually when we think of dissociation, we think of a person that cannot fight or flight because of trauma.  And so their response is to go to freeze or dissociate.  Go to an internal world where they are not present in the present.  So they do not have to feel their emotions.  They do not have to be present to their circumstances.  They can escape to this dissociated internal world.  And so much of trauma response is a form of dissociation.  What can happen with some people is they actually go a step further and they dissociate from their body as well.  So they are no longer aware of their body.  They no longer feel connected to their body.  They do not even feel a lot of their bodily sensations.  So they dissociate not just from emotions, not just from their environment.  They dissociate from their body as well.  So that is what is called disembodiment.  It's the experience of losing one's touch with one's body, including feelings of your body sensations, movements of your body and how your body relates to others.  So it's almost like you are in a body, but you do not feel connected to your body.  You feel disembodied from your body.  Your body is not hardly even part of you.  So disembodiment refers to a feeling as if you are not present in your body, such as spacing out or feeling that you are observing your body from outside of it.  Unsafe in your body out of control of your body or experiencing unpleasant feelings in your body.  And for many with complex trauma, this is huge.  And it takes, often takes a while to become aware of this.  Often you become aware of your emotional dissociation before you become aware of your body dissociation, but eventually become aware of this and the degrees and how it works itself out in your life.  Suzy Ferrello says this, did it ever happen to you that you feel like a stranger to your own body?  Have you ever had those mornings in which you do not recognize yourself in the mirror or you do not accept the imperfections you see on your face?  It might happen that those mornings stretch into a day of senseless feelings when whatever touches your body does not truly reach you, whether the hug of a friend or the swift contact of someone we barely know.  Although feeling disembodied does not seem to have immediate consequences, it can still make us miserable.  Feeling disembodied might create a drift between ourselves and our lives because somehow we get out of touch with the instruments that allow us to live fully.  In other words, people go, well disembodied, but I do not think it really affects me a whole lot.  Yes, it does.  You may not see the effects immediately, but part of true joy and happiness and living life fully is being fully present to your body.  So let me give you some examples of disembodiment.  So it's a person that they are full and their bodies trying to tell them they are full, but they ignore it.  They do not even realize that they are not aware of it.  They just keep eating way past the full sensation or a person who's hungry and they are not even aware of it.  They end up with anorexia nervosa.  They are just the hunger sensation no longer registers.  Or you can take it to a person who pushes past what their body is saying in workouts.  Their body is saying I am tired.  I cannot take anymore.  I have had enough and they just pushed past it.  They ignore all the bodily sensations.  Another way that disembodiment can show up is that you are much more attuned to others' emotions, others' needs, others' expectations, but you are not attuned to your own.  You are not attuned to your own needs, but you are not attuned to your own body.  So a child who's been trained to be more attuned to others than themselves often ends up with disembodiment feelings.  Another one that they are finding is bed-wedding.  So bed-wedding or anuresis, you have to be in touch with bodily and sensation.  So if a person has dissociated so much from their body, they can be not even in touch with bodily sensations and the need to go to the bathroom.  So dissociative disorders can be associated with anuresis or bed-wedding, which can also be caused by psychological or emotional stress.  Now a new disorder has come along that's connected to this and it's called depersonalization, de-realization disorder.  So the depersonalization part of that is you feel detached from yourself and the de-realization part of that is you feel disconnected from your environment.  So while feelings like this may come and go for many people, people with this disorder, they persist for a long time or they come for a long time, go away, but then they come back.  And so it's this very regular long-lasting state of feeling disconnected from your body, yourself or from your environment.  So depersonalization affects your ability to recognize your thoughts, feelings and body as your own.  It might feel like you are watching yourself play a role in a movie rather than living your life.  De-realization affects your ability to see your surroundings accurately.  Things might not seem real or you might feel like you are looking through a clouded window or in black and white rather than in full color.  So let me give you some symptoms of the de-personalization.  So you feeling that you are seeing your thoughts or you are seeing your feelings or body or parts of your body from the outside.  For example, you may feel like you are floating in the air above yourself watching your body perform your thoughts, your feelings, or you feel like a robot and that you are not in control of what you say or how you move.  The sense that your body, legs or arms appear twisted or like they are not the right shape or they may seem larger or smaller than usual.  You also could feel that your head is wrapped in cotton or emotional or physical numbness in your senses or responses to the world around you.  You just constantly just feel numb.  A sense that your memories lack emotion and that they may or may not be your own memories they just do not feel real.  Then symptoms of de-realization.  So feeling that your body and your surroundings are not real like you are living in a movie or a dream.  Feeling emotionally disconnected from people you care about is if you are separated by a glass wall.  Surroundings that appear out of their usual shape or blurry or colorless or they may seem like they have two dimensions so they they are flat with no depth.  They are not three-dimensional or you could be more aware of your surroundings and they just appear clearer than usual.  So there's a sharpening of focus or thoughts about time that are not real such as recent events feeling like they are the distant past or unrealistic thoughts about distance and the size and shape of objects.  So again people can have boats of this but to have the disorder it must last for days, weeks, months.  So I do not know how this affects you.  I suspect that for a lot of people listening you are going, wow I relate to a lot of this.  I never really piece this together before that trauma has affected my body so much.  What do I do about it?  And this to me is huge.  This is where we are really learning that a lot of important healing comes through what we call embodiment.  So trauma results in dissociation from your body, disembodiment, depersonalization, de-realization, all of those forms of disconnection from your body.  So healing becomes getting in touch with your body but it's more than that.  So much of trauma therapy in the past has been thinking that the brain is the key element to healing and it is a major element.  And it's thinking you just have to get people thinking correctly, you have to help people understand how their brain works, heal the limbic part of the brain, all of that is important.

But so much of the emphasis has been just on the importance of the brain and healing the brain.  And basically that the brain determines one's actions, attitudes, behaviors, the brain is the main part of everything.

But what we are learning is the body influences the brain.  Somebody said this, states of the body modifies states of the mind.  All psychological processes are influenced by the body.  In other words, for a person to heal, they have to heal the brain.  They have to heal the psychological processes, all the mild adaptations.

But a key part of the healing process is to heal the body, to get in touch with the body, to embody the body, to be embodied, to develop a good relationship with your body, to reconnect with your body to allow the body to help you in the healing process.  So Melchiodi wrote this, embodiment implies that the central focus for emotional repair, transformation, and recovery is through becoming aware of your physical being through the senses.  It is a way to include the body as a focus for health and well-being through self-appreciation and self-acceptance of what we physically sense and feel in the moment.  In other words, we are learning.  The body, getting in touch with the body, being okay with your body, is critical for healing trauma.  Amber Gray said, we each have a right to inhabit our bodies with safety and self-agency and with joy, curiosity, and enlivenment.  The body is not something we should be afraid of.  The body is something that is our safe place that we have a wonderful relationship with.  That's where we are heading.  And Safi Biasetti said this, embodiment can be simply defined as living life in forms through the sense experience of the body.  And embodiment in our context is not a noun, it's a verb.  It's an active and intentional process, not a static thing.

Furthermore, it's a choice to consciously inhabit the full spectrum of our experience of being a human, not dissecting different sensory pathways.  In other words, to be fully human, we have to be intellectual, we have to be emotional, but we have to live fully in our body and experience all the sensations of our body.  That is what we are saying.  It is not a set of practices intended to create certain desired therapeutic outcomes, though we use practices to learn how to embody.  They are like a baseball player hitting balls in a batting cage.  The point is not to hit balls over and over again.  The point is to hone one's overall ability as a baseball player.  The act of expanding one's self-awareness to include not just your emotions, not just your thinking, but the felt experience of the body, such as sensory, sensational, emotional, and physical experiences, and incorporating that information into one's overall conception and conduct of themselves, their identity, beliefs, behavior, and ways of being.  That's what embodiment is.  It's bringing all that our body is and communicates to us into our experience, into recovery, and it's so important in the healing.  Kathy Melchiori says, this somatic awareness is not just about the identification of distress, so the danger and embodiment is people want to get in touch with their body just to become more aware of bodily sensations, and that mainly is becoming aware of pain in their body, distress in their body.  What she's saying is that's part of it, but it goes way beyond that.  It also is about engaging our body's capacity as a positive resource when we are distressed.  I call this restorative embodiment, a somatic shift that helps us focus on what our bodies can experience to counteract activation and withdrawal, so we are not just aware of our bodies, we are using our bodies to help heal the body.  That is what we call bottom-up approaches.  We have learned for many years now that you do not heal trauma with top-down with your brain cortex only.  That's important, but you have to use bottom-up approaches.  You have to use the body to help heal trauma.  What is becoming popular and very effective is what is called action, psychotherapy, or movement therapy.  So it's a form of therapy where your body is used to facilitate healing of feelings that might be trapped within your body, and so you are using movement to help heal emotions.  Types of psychotherapies that are experiential as opposed to only talking during sessions means one explores feelings through action, so drama, art, music, danics, movement.  All of those are becoming very important types of therapies to help get in touch with our bodies, be aware of our bodies, but to use our bodies to help in getting in touch with our feelings are thinking and to heal.  Gabra Matay's developed compassionate inquiry, and it's understanding that much of trauma got stored preverbally as physical sensation, and so when a person is triggered it's becoming aware of what you are feeling in your body at that moment, seeing all of that with compassion and curiosity about the first time it occurred in your life.  Then mindfulness, we often think of mindfulness in terms of being mindful of our emotional state and our mental state, but mindfulness needs to expand to becoming aware of our physical body sensations.  We have talked about somatic healing, all the different types of somatic healing that help the vagus nerve and help us to get into our parasympathetic nervous system in a healthy way.  Then what they have found is yoga and meditation are just so helpful in this becoming more embodied.  Then EMDR, eye movement, desensitization, reprocessing is effective in this.  Tension, release exercises, so tensing all your muscles up in your body and then releasing them.  Finding that to be very helpful for helping people start to connect to their body, get in touch with their body.  I hope what I am helping you realize is in order for us to heal from trauma, there's a mental aspect, there's an emotional aspect, there's a relational aspect, a connection aspect, but there's also a body aspect.  Many people with trauma have felt disconnected from their body to some degree or another, and so this becomes an important part of the healing process.  I hope that helps you.  I hope it gets you started in becoming more aware of this area.  Well that's the end of another Friday night.  Thank you for being with us.
