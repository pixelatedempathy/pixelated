over 90% of people with complex trauma end up with anxiety and depression, and the two usually go together. So if you were to reduce a definition of anxiety or understanding anxiety, think of it through the eyes of a child. You feel anxiety when you don't have resources to handle a situation. Anxiety or fear then is actually a gift, because what happens when you don't have resources as a child to handle a scary situation? You feel fear, but what does fear make you do? It makes you run to somebody who's bigger than you, who's stronger than you, who can protect you, and it makes you want to connect with them, and if you connect with them, and they then come in to protect you and help you with that circumstance that's too big for you, then you relax, because the problem is now resolved. You've connected to somebody stronger than you that loves you. So fear is a gift that drives you to the right person for protection, and so that the situation is resolved. But what happens in complex trauma? The child's in a situation that they can't handle. They're afraid they're going to get hurt. They run to mom and dad to connect, and no connection is available. Dad's too busy. Mom's got her own mental health issues. They're angry. They lash out, all kinds of different things, but they're not able to connect with the people they should be able to connect to. They're afraid. They're afraid of the people they should be able to connect to. Therefore, they're not able to resolve the fear. The problem doesn't go away, and so the fear now is constantly there, because they feel all alone to face a scary, big, bad world. They feel abandoned, and fear becomes a constant, and it now begins to control because basically if I can't connect with anybody, I better figure out how to do keeping myself safe, and so fear just constantly becomes this controlling emotion for them. So let me just take you through a list of the main fears that come out of this fear, and then I'm going to give you a bunch of secondary fears, and you can check off the ones that are true of you, and what you're going to hopefully begin to see is how much fear actually plays a part in your life, and it might be a little bit scary, but hopefully eye-opening and lead to some real growth for you. Fear of getting hurt. That's the big fear, because you see, I'm just me. I can't connect with anybody, so I'm going to have to do a lot of work. I'm going to constantly be going up against things that are dangerous and bigger than me, so I could get hurt physically, emotionally, and I don't want that. So there's this constant fear in every situation of getting hurt. How do I avoid it? Next one, fear of failure. You see, in a healthy home, if a child fails, the parents nurture the child, teach the child, and they're going to be able to do a lot of work. So I'm going to constantly be going up against things that are dangerous and bigger than me, and I'm going to want to keep trying to do it. So I'm going to have to keep trying to do it. So I'm going to have to keep trying to do it. the failure, the failure turns into a positive growth experience. What happens in many complex trauma homes is if you fail, then you get made fun of, you get punished, you get disrespected, you get told you're stupid, people are impatient with you, people reject you. So failure is not a positive thing. Failure is a negative thing that hurts but also results in more painful things shame disrespect rejection and so for most people coming out of complex trauma they don't ever want to fail because fail failure for them nothing good comes out of failure so they have a great fear of failure then that fear of the unknown when I go into a new situation that I've never been in before oh something might be there that could hurt me and so there's a huge fear of going into unknowns it just triggers a whole bunch of fear and that's why for many people when they go into an unknown situation they pester you wanting to know every little detail about what's going to happen because they're trying to get rid of as much as possible of the unknown and they're trying to get rid of as much as possible of the unknown many unknowns as possible that's how big their fear is fear of change every time you go through a change you're kind of going into a new unknown you might know some of the new territory but you're not going to know all of the new territory because stuff has changed so you might get hurt and that's what's coming up again unknown possible hurt change possible hurt therefore the brain says avoid change avoid the unknown that's the way to avoid hurt but one that very interesting for many people is fear of success so if you've gone through a life where you were put down nobody taught you tools so failure was a constant part of your life now you're learning tools now you're beginning to grow and you're learning to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to learn to grow and you're getting successful your relationships are going well your job is going well and what happens in the brain is this is an unknown we've never been here before we don't know how to handle this something bad might happen we could get hurt so success let's not celebrate it let's get scared is what comes out of that fear and then for other people coming out of complex trauma one of the worst times for them in childhood when is when everything was quiet and going smoothly because for them that meant oh the other shoe is about to drop something bad is about to happen so as soon as anything is going too smoothly uh-oh that is a sign that something bad is about to happen and so that leads to the next thing that characterizes people with complex trauma is they often sabotage success they sabotage when things are going smoothly because they go something bad is going to happen anyways so let's just get it over with and go back to failure back to pain and chaos and drama because we know how to handle that so maybe something bad happened many of us areでき to το good can do good work all that that by earlier painting and Didn't You See Tim uh thisabolism came up and said you can't say this moment but we need to have a real savior after this I'm afraid of being a Первin Because then you're going to think I'm too much work and you'll reject me. And then also coming out of shame is I long for intimacy, but I'm afraid of intimacy. Because if you get to know me too well, you're going to find out I'm not much of a catch and you're going to reject me. So there's a bunch of fears we've already covered. I just want to repeat. The next one that's so important to understand is people with complex trauma want to hope, but they're afraid to hope. So the graph shows what happens for most people coming out of complex trauma. They get their hopes up that, okay, dad just rejected me. Dad didn't have time for me. I couldn't connect with dad and I tried. I didn't get my needs met. So. So hopefully if I just change, it must be my fault. So I'll do more chores. I'll be kinder to dad. I'll do extra things for dad. And then hopefully then dad will accept me and want to connect with me and meet my needs. So that's where they go in their head. So they start doing extra stuff and it seems to be going well. Dad seems to be. He's not rejecting them. He's kind of meeting their needs. So they start to get. Their hopes up. And then all some something triggers dad and it's back to disconnect, not meeting needs, rejection, hurt. Their hopes get dashed. Now there's really two dynamics that have happened there. Number one is they got hurt and that is very painful. But secondly, they got their hopes up in their hopes for dashed. That's really painful. That's a second. Painful. Pain that got added onto it. But the child has this amazing capacity to keep hoping. And they keep thinking, okay, it must be my fault. I got to figure out what I'm not doing right. And I got to change that. So maybe if I wear this mask, maybe if I become a hero, maybe if I become a comedian, maybe if I get involved in sports because dad likes sports and they just keep trying one option after another. And each time they get their hopes up, maybe this is going to result in getting connection in my needs net. And it doesn't. Around 10 to 13, they finally get to a point where they go, I don't think there's any point in getting my hopes up anymore because dad is never going to meet my needs. Dad's not going to connect with me. And they lose hope. Now, what happens 20 years later? They get into recovery. They start doing well. They get a good job relationships. And it goes, do I get my hopes up that I'm going to get a healthier, better life? Oh, boy. Every time I've got my hopes up so far in life, they've got dashed. You know what? I don't know if I want to get my hopes up again. So that, again, is where a lot of people will sabotage doing well in recovery to avoid getting better. It's easier in their mind to not have hope. It's less painful to not have hope than to get your hopes up and have them dashed. That's a powerful fear. Now, the next one to me is one of the biggest ones that most people aren't aware of. And that's the fear of abandonment. So what happens in complex trauma? A child wants to connect but can't. So they feel rejected. They feel neglected. They feel alone. But they feel abandoned. Some are actually literally abandoned. They're given up to the child welfare system or for adoption. But even in homes that their physical needs are met, when their emotional needs aren't consistently met, they feel a certain amount of abandonment. What? What is the thing, the hurt, the wound that gives the worst, greatest pain? I think it's abandonment. Nothing says to you more loudly and more painfully that you are a zero than for people to abandon you. Basically, it says you're worthless. We don't want anything to do with you. It is the loudest statement of a shame message. That you have zero value. It is super, super painful. And what comes out of that is this deep fear of ever being abandoned again. Of a commitment to never be abandoned again. That is so loud inside of most people. Loud in the sense that it's big. But they're not. Maybe. They're not aware of it. So let me just get you to think about this a little bit further. Because to me it's such an important thing to understand. And to see if it applies to you. See, what happens when a person is abandoned, it alters their identity from positive to negative. From I have value to I have no value. It's the biggest shame message. And the child believes it. Usually at a subconscious. Level. It is the controlling core belief. I have no value. So what happens when they go into a relationship in adult life. Is they basically have already concluded that once these people get to know me. They're going to abandon me. Just like mom and dad. That's the truth of my life. They're going to find out I have zero value. Zero value. So. With that core belief guiding them as they go into relationships. When they get into a relationship. They now. Twist and distort everything that the other person does. To fit that belief. That they must see I don't have value. They must think I don't have value. They must be preparing to abandon me. They think I'm stupid. They're about to reject me. All of what the other person does. Gets twisted to fit. The core belief. So let me show you some of the things. That happens. So let's say. They're watching this person. They're now building a friendship with. In a relationship with. And they see them doing all kinds of nice things. To them. But they have a core. Abandonment. Shame. Belief. So what do they say in their head. Well. They twist that. They go. Okay. They're acting loving to me. They don't really love me. They're just probably using me. They've got some agenda for me. They're saying lots of nice things to me. But they're probably. Saying. Lots of negative things behind my back about me. Wow. They didn't seem super excited to see me today. Yesterday. Their eyes lit up when they saw me. Today's their eyes didn't. Light up. Oh. Oh. They're probably. Getting tired of me. And are getting ready to get rid of me. Or. They probably have so many filters in their brain when they talk to me. If they were to take those filters out. They would say all kinds of negative things to me about me. And only a few positive things. But because of all of their filters. They only say positive things to me. They must filter out. Hundreds of negative things that they wish they could say. But they don't want to hurt my feelings. Or. You see them talking to somebody else. And they're laughing and having a good time. And you go. See. They're probably. More interested in that person now than me. They're probably going to start spending more time with that person. And less time with me. And eventually they're just going to. Leave me. And that's going to be their main friend. That's. That's what's going on. In the brain of a person with. That fear of abandonment. But then it goes even further. They will then. Go you're going to abandon me anyways. So I am going to try to drive you away. And they actually. The very thing they fear. Is to be abandoned. But they actually end up creating. Trying to get people to abandon them. So they'll do it in. One of two ways. Or both. Become super super needy. Clingy. Demanding. Smothering. Not give the person any space. Always there. Always wanting something. Always wanting attention and validation. And the other person. Person eventually just goes. Whoa. Whoa. You're way too much work. I can't take this. You don't respect my boundaries. I'm out of here. And the person goes. See. They're going to abandon me anyways. That's what everybody does. Without realizing. They brought it about. Or some. They meet a really healthy person. And then they meet a really unhealthy person. And they will get in a relationship. With an unhealthy person. But the really healthy person. They go. Nope. And they just cut that person out of their life. Because they don't feel worthy of them. They feel that once that healthy person sees them. That healthy person. Not going to want anything to do with them. When they see what they're really like. And so they create. Abandonment. By healthy people. Get in relationships with unhealthy people. Who will eventually abandon them. And then another thing they do. Is they test. Constantly in relationships. By game playing. So they might just. The person wants to give them affection. And they just push them away. Person wants to talk. They don't want to talk. Why? They're testing. Is they're going to keep pursuing me? Are they going to. Give up easily. Or are they going to keep. Trying to get to me. Or they might question them. And go. You know. You don't really love me. Do you? And they might put that question. Many many different ways. But. But they're just. Constantly challenging. You don't really love me. Or. Or they may go around. You know what? I'm such a loser. I don't know why you have me. Why you want a relationship with me. You're probably. Getting tired of me. You're probably going to. Start to think about finding somebody else. Because I'm just. I have nothing to offer. Or they might even suggest someone. Have you noticed that person over there? Wow. I just. Really am impressed with them. They're so nice. They're so outgoing. And you're. You're just. Testing to see what their response is going to be. To that person. Testing. Testing. Testing. Are they going to abandon me? But do you realize how. Tiring that gets in a relationship? And all the time is you're not receiving any love from them. You're keeping them at arm's length. And that takes to the next one. People with huge abandonment issues. Basically. Say I can't let anybody connect. In a healthy way with me. And truly get to know me intimately. I need to maintain walls. I need to wear masks. Adopt roles. That's the only way they're going to want to stay with me. Is with a. Fake intimacy. A superficial intimacy. And so. What? They do. Is keep walls in place. So a person trying to get to know them. They keep bumping into a wall. They only get to know them so far. And then they can't get to know the real them. And what do you do? You end up driving people away. Or. Some go to. Creating unrealistic expectations. For the relationship. So what they basically say is. If you love me. And you're not going to abandon me. Then. You will only love me. You won't love anybody else. If you love anybody else. That's a sign you're going to abandon me. And so they then try to control. All the other relationships. So you have no other friendships. I'm the only person in your life. That's my way of. Securing that you're not going to abandon me. We see how. That's abusive. That's not going to work. Second thing some people. Do as far as expectations is. The only way I can be sure. You're not going to abandon me. Is. That you never have a flaw. You never fail me. You never let me down. You basically are perfect. The moment I find a flaw. And you can be sure. I'm going to be looking for a flaw. The moment I find a flaw. I'm going to be looking for a flaw. That's going to make me. You're not going to be a failure. You're not going to be a failure. You're not going to be a failure. You're not going to be a failure. You're not going to be a failure. You're not going to be a failure. Nobody can live up to that. Or another one is. You must give me constant validation. You must tell me many times. Every day. Fuss over me. How you love me. How wonderful I am. On and on. If you don't. Then that tells me. You must find me unlovable. And you're planning to leave me. Or you must never. set boundaries with me. You must never say no to me. You must never require your own space. You must never confront me. You must let me do whatever I want. That's the only way I can be convinced you're not going to abandon me. That's really unhealthy. You must give me constant attention. If you want to do something on your own one night, well, basically that tells me you're losing interest in me and you're going to abandon me. So you must have no personal space. And then you must never criticize me, give me constructive criticism, give me advice because that's saying I'm wrong, I'm stupid. That's saying you look down on me. That's saying you reject me and so you're going to abandon me. So you must never say anything. You must never say anything negative to me. So all of those for many people come out of that fear of abandonment. And it is just huge and I hope if you can see that in yourself, you realize that healing that fear is healing the deep wound of abandonment and the shame that goes with it. Okay, next fear that comes out of complex trauma. Fear of angry people. Many people grew up with anger, were abused because of anger. They just hate conflict. They just give in to make peace at any price because they're afraid of angry people. And then, like we said, you create what you fear and we looked at it with abandonment. Let me give you just one more example. A lot of people who are never validated as a child, they're afraid of anger. They're afraid of anger. And as a child, they long for validation. Their fear is that they're not going to get validation. But what they end up doing is creating what they fear, so they long for validation. That's what they want so much. They fear never being validated. So what do they do? They try to be the center of attention all the time. They ask people constantly, did I do good? Did I do good? Do I do good? And after a while, people just go. Whoa! this person is way too needy, and they just stopped giving them validation. So the person created the very thing they feared, the thing they were trying to avoid. And that's the sad thing that comes out of complex trauma.
