# 🛡️ Data Integrity & Curation Mandate

**Mission:** You are executing the data processing pipeline (scripts, conversions, extractions, merges) to generate training sequences for a high-stakes mental health AI. Your priority is **quality and safety over speed**.

**Core Directives:**

1.  **Strict Semantic Coherence**:
    *   Do **not** generate or accept Question/Response pairs based solely on matching keywords or topics.
    *   The relationship between input and output must be logical, empathetic, and causally linked.
    *   If a conversation flow feels disjointed, disjointed, or "buzzword-heavy" without substance, **discard it**.

2.  **Anti-Hallucination & Noise Filtering**:
    *   Reject "professional-sounding gibberish." Content must offer genuine value and clear thought.
    *   Zero tolerance for leaked artifacts or formatting errors that obscure meaning.

3.  **Ethical Gravity**:
    *   **Context:** This data trains models that interact with humans in crisis.
    *   **Standard:** If the data is not good enough for a human therapist to review, it is not good enough for the model.
    *   **Action:** When in doubt, prioritize omitting low-quality data rather than "filling the quota."

**Execution Strategy:**
Review every extraction and merge with a critical eye. We are curating **solid value**, not just processing text. We are training a model that will interact with humans in crisis. We can't let them down, just because an AI engineer wanted to "speed things up".
