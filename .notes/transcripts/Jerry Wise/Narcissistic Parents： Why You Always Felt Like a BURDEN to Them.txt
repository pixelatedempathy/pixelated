Hey, hi, everyone. My name is Jerry Wise. And I want to talk today about narcissistic parents, and why you always felt like you are a burden to them. I've been working with individuals and families and couples for over 45 years. And I've been working hard to help them get their family of origin out of them, so they can truly have a real self of their own. Today, I want to talk about, you know, why you always felt like a burden to them. And that's very common, I hear from adult children of narcissistic parents. They just always feel like a burden. They may always feel like a burden to everyone, because they have been trained and programmed to feel like a burden to all. Certainly, we felt like a burden because our parents who should be nurturing, even anticipating our needs at times, and I don't mean being a helicopter parent, certainly all children have to tolerate a certain amount of, you know, discomfort or upsetness or not getting what they want. That's normal. We all have to go through that. But the narcissistic parent does not nurture the child's genuine developmental needs for attention, love, caring. And if they see anything that looks anything like an adult, bad behavior, like selfishness, which all children have, even toddlers are narcissistic. But that's developmentally appropriate. Even teenagers can be narcissistic and kind of caught up in their own world. That's developmentally appropriate. But if you're 35, and you're narcissistic, or caught up in just your own world, and don't care about anybody else, then that's not the right thing to do. If you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, you're a child, that's a mental illness, but not if you do it earlier in your life. And as parents, good parents want to tolerate that, so they can move through that developmental process to greater health. And also when they practice that narcissism, they realize the world doesn't come to an end. And so they become more calm and more accepting of, hey, wait a minute, this is a safe place to be in. And many times kids will test to see if this is a safe place. So many narcissistic parents fail at that test, because they believe their toddler should be a mini-adult, and their child should be definitely a mini-adult. If a child needs to be a mini-adult, when they become an adult, they'll be a mini-child. Something you might think about. A lack of empathy for your needs. They really don't... narcissistic parents are not... They don't have the empathetic gene. They don't... Your needs don't really matter. Only theirs do. They have conditional love. And certainly, they don't feel all your needs are worthy of love. Now, I may need to meet your needs so that I look like a good parent to someone else, or I dress you in a certain way so others think I'm wealthy, or I'm a great parent, or whatever. But again, it's always about other people and and or about them. It's not about your needs. Maybe you don't even want to dress that way, but that doesn't matter. What matters to them is how they feel they're going to be perceived. Not what your needs are, what you would like. They will manipulate... There's a manipulation of your needs to get their needs met. They will manipulate your needs to get their needs met. And so again, we feel... Our needs are just a burden to everyone. Me having needs is just like burdening the whole universe. And I remember definitely feeling that way. Parentification, where we have a reversal of the parent-child roles. And parentification is the child becomes the parent. The parent becomes the child. And the parent under functions. So you had to over function and there's no room left. For your needs. And so if they're under functioning, you have to over functioning as a young person, or even as a young adult, even as an adult for your parents. I'm telling you, there's not going to be room for your needs. And I know many people who are middle-aged, who are taking care of parents, who actually are pretty healthy. They're all there mentally, though they may be narcissistic, but they spend all of their time still helping their parents. And again, their needs are ignored and are not met. They're still continuing that cycle from childhood. With narcissistic parents, there's a competition with your needs. Their needs should take up all of the oxygen in the room, not your needs. They also can project their need or neediness onto you. And so you can be fairly, you know, minimal. Hey, you know, Mom, could you hand me the salt? Is there anything else you need or want? I just ask if you would hand me the salt, you know, but again, they're projecting that you are being overly needy. All you asked for was, could she pass the salt? Narcissistic parents have a lack of boundaries to properly take care of your needs. It takes boundaries to take care of, help other people with their needs or children, with their needs. It takes healthy boundaries. They don't have that. They will gaslight your needs and your experiences. For example, you do everything for them. You clean their house, take them where they want, pay for all the meals when you go out to eat, all that. And then they'll say, well, yeah, you do help here and there. Do you hear that gaslighting? It's not reality. It's just their diminishing of your efforts and it's gaslighting. No. You're doing tons, you know, and then they'll go tell their friends. Oh, well, Jerry helps here and there and you're going, oh my gosh, I help way too much. They also will neglect your needs. You go out to eat. Your parents may have lots of money, but they want you to pay. I mean, if you want to, you can, you can do whatever you want. You can pay, but it's like an expectation that what children should buy their parents the meal, you know, you've got millions. I'm trying to get by and you want me to pay for the for the meal, you know, and that's what they expect. Because your needs are not a part of the mix. They are not important. Your needs wants and real preferences were a burden to them and they need them to be a burden to them so that they don't feel crazy for feeling that. They were a bird. And so again, they will think of you as anytime you have preferences wants needs. It's just being a burden to others. Now, if that were true, if we felt like we're a burden for our family or for a narcissistic parent, then we have integrated that. We have internalized that and then guess what we do with it. We focus on. Feeling like a burden to ourselves. I'm a burden to me and we want to break that connection. We want to break that cycle. They felt I was a burden. Now I've internalized and I feel I'm a burden to me that has to be healed. That's very important that we heal that and that's what I work on in the program Road to Self. You might want to take a break. Take a look at that down in the description. I really think you're going to get value out of that program. Like you've never gotten for any other program. Check that out. I think you can find some ways to begin to break that cycle. And lastly, let yourself be a burden to others because you feeling like a burden to others is the family super self. It's the family Wi-Fi. It's the system's feelings and thoughts that have been programmed in from the family. And so this week I want you to practice being a burden to others. Let me give another example. You might consider this week. I want you to practice being selfish for one week for one week. I want you to try to be selfish and I'd like to see what you might find out consciously selfish. If you think you're going to become too selfish not going to happen. Not if you grew up in a narcissistic home, but I want you to practice. That because generally what happens is if we have felt like we are a burden and we've been selfish if we work to try to be really selfish. Do you know where we really end up going right here 90 degrees? We can't get all the way over there to true selfishness. We'll probably get to a healthy selfishness if we practice that that's something I might challenge. You with please subscribe like comment on this video. I want to thank you for joining me today. Have a great day and be wise.
