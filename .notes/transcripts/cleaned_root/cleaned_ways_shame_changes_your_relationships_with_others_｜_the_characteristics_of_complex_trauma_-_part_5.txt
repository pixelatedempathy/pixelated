We are moving along in our series on pulling all of the 85 characteristics of complex trauma together in summary form and today I come to the last ones that come out of shame.  So what we saw is that complex trauma.  One of the most damaging effects is it changes the identity of a child from positive to negative.  So it creates the shame identity that I am not good enough.  Something's wrong with me.  I am not lovable.  I am not valuable.  And so that then results in all kinds of different characteristics that come out of that which are the brain trying to solve shame.  The brain trying to feel better about oneself, the brain trying to get others to feel to respect you trying to hide that true identity.  And so what we have seen is there's over 20 different characteristics that come out of just shame.  So today I want to wrap that part up.  And the first one I want to look at is manipulation.  So in a healthy home, a child's able to be authentic.  They can trust that those in authority want the best for them.  And so they openly communicate their needs.  They openly communicate their desires, their dreams.  And they are listened to.  They are heard.  The parents are understand them and get them.  And so the child does not have to try to manipulate anybody to get their needs met.  They just communicate their needs and know that the parents want what is best for the child.  And the child trusts that.

But in complex trauma, it's very different.  So the child follows those healthy instincts initially.  They communicate their needs.  They communicate their desires.  They are authentic.

But those get left at.  Those get punished.  Those get shame.  And the child begins to feel something's wrong with me.  I am not good enough to have needs as to be rejected.  So they still have needs.

But how do they get those needs met?  They cannot just express them honestly.  So the child has to begin to learn to manipulate.  It's the only way of survival.  It's the only way of getting their needs met.  Now we have done an entire video around manipulation tactics in the boundary series.

But let me just kind of give you the highlights of the main manipulation tactics that a child begins to learn.  So the one, the first one is love bombing.  And that is, if I am super, super, super nice to you.  If I give you lots of things, then you will want to give me something back.  So it's a way of manipulating by being super nice.  And children learn to do that.  They bring their dad coffee.  They do extra chores for dad.  And then they want to ask dad for something.  The second one is using guilt.  And so many think of this in terms of how their parents try to manipulate them.  If they are, if they set a boundary with their parents, and the parents say, after all we have done for you, you are so selfish.  And it's basically trying to create a feeling of guilt in the child that they are a selfish, unappreciative child that then causes them to, okay, I will do whatever you want, just do not just to get rid of the guilt.  Then some begin to use false accusations.  So they misrepresent the story.  So some children, they will tell you a situation.  And they only tell you 75% of it.  They leave out a few details.  They only include the details that make you want to help.  That make you think the child is asking for something very reasonable.  So they learn to manipulate the truth in order to manipulate people.  Others, they will have, again, think in terms of their family, where their family will falsely accuse them of stuff in order to get them to go, no, that's not me.  I will prove you wrong.  So they go, you think you are better than us.  You do not value your family.  All you think of is yourself.  And so now that the person goes, no, that's not true.  I will give you whatever you want, I will do whatever you want, just so you do not think badly of me.  So false accusations is a tactic used to manipulate people.  Then a big one within complex trauma families is fear, the threat of violence, the threat that if you tell this secret, if you tell anybody about this, I will hurt you, I will hurt your sister, I will kill you, or many children begin to go, I am going to go commit suicide.  If you do not do what I want, I will kill myself.  And that fear causes the people to do whatever they want.  Another one is anger and intimidation.  And so that fear of angry people.  So if you become very intimidating, if you get angry, I will do whatever you want.  Just do not be angry at me.  So it's a powerful manipulation tool.  Then some go more passive aggressive.  And it's, I am going to punish you if you do not give me what I want.  So I will withhold love.  I will pout.  I will give you the silent treatment.  I will be super cold to you.  I will give you one word answers when you want to connect.  I will push your buttons on purpose just to get you angry.  So I am going to punish you for not giving me what I want.  Others, they learned an egg.  If you say no the first time, that's all right.  I will just keep asking until you get tired of me asking and give in and say yes.  Some resort to begging.  I would do whatever you want.  Please just give me this.  I beg of you.  And so it's just lording themself to that servile place of begging just to get what they want.  Others create a crisis.  So you set a boundary with your mom.  Let's say I can only see you once a week when you mom's been used to seeing you every day.  Mom does not like that.  And so all of a sudden mom creates a crisis.  Oh, I am having a hard time.  I really, really, really need you just to get you to go and spend more time with her more frequently or people propose a compromise.  So we will not date anymore, but how be we still be just be friends or how we still go for a coffee once in a while.  So you are still manipulating to keep the relationship.  You are just formally saying it's no longer a relationship.  Then there's triangulation.  So this is where mom's upset that you have set a boundary and are only going to visit once a month.  She may have tried all the other things to guilt trip you to create a crisis and you have not given in.  So now all of a sudden you get a phone call from your aunt.  And it's very concerned about your mother.  She's not sleeping well.  And I think it's because you are not seeing her very often.  And so now you are getting a third party that is voicing mom's request.  Then you can get all they can then start including all kinds of different friends and family members who start coming and taking you aside and talking to you and putting pressure on you to go back to do what mom wants.  So these are called hooks where the person who does not like the boundary is trying to hook you back to the old boundary and they are manipulating you by playing off different emotions to get you to go back to the old boundary.  And then some people they recruit support not just from family, not just through triangulation, but they go, wow, I was on Google and I found out all this information that you need to see your mother more regularly.  And they present all the experts say evidence to try and add pressure to you.  So manipulation, if that became a child's way of surviving, to come into recovery and to realize manipulation absolutely destroys trust and relationship.  It causes people to suspect there's always a hit in gender agenda.  They suspect that they are going to be used somehow that the truth that you are saying is not actually what you are what's really going on.  It just begins to destroy, break down, trust, intimacy, connection, relationships.  You begin to feel this relationship is not about love.  This is relationship is about them trying to use me.  And so in recovery you go manipulation has to go.  I have to learn to be open and honest and vulnerable about my needs and desires.  So again, understand you can only do that with safe people.  It will not work with unsafe people.  They will use it against you.  So you need safe people.

But as you begin to get honest about your needs, it creates fear.  Fear that you are going to be rejected.  Fear that people are going to see you as a burden.  Fear that people are going to say no and not like you and set up more boundaries with you.  And so you have to fight through fear.  So what I am hoping you see in a lot of these things is to heal actually triggers fear.  To get healthy actually triggers a fear response that wants to go back to unhealthy.  And so you got to fight through that fear and say no, I know my cortex.  This is healthy.  I have to stick to the plan.  And usually you find while it was worth it.  The next characteristic that comes at a shame is this you long for intimacy, but you are afraid of intimacy.  So a child again has these built in longings that are all connected to wanting connection intimate relationship.  They want to be authentic.  They want to be known intimately.  They want to be fully accepted.  They want to share that with another person and experience not just physical intimacy, but they want to experience a deeper intimacy that comes from a deep knowledge of a person shared values, shared passions, shared beliefs, a deep understanding of that person and acceptance of that person.  Healthy meaningful relationships come out of that deepening intimacy that contains vulnerability, authenticity, total acceptance, total validation and knowledge of each other.  That is such a powerful thing that comes to complex trauma again.  A child tries to follow all of those longings to be authentic, to connect, to have intimacy, to be known, to be heard.  And they get ashamed, they get punished, they get rejected, they get hurt over and over again.  And so they go intimacy always ends up in getting hurt.

But the longing for that deep intimacy does not disappear, especially when they get into their teen years, into their 20s.  They just long for that companionship, that deep connection, that deep relationship intimacy.

But they go, I am afraid of it.  I am afraid if I go down that road, I am going to get hurt badly.  And so they long for it, but the fear keeps them from pursuing it.  So what they tend to do is the next characteristic, and that is they go for pseudo-connection, fake connection.  So I cannot have true deep intimacy.  Let's have kind of a fake false intimacy.  Let's do things that make us feel connected, but not at a deep, deep level.  So they give feelings of connection, but there's no total authenticity, total acceptance, total vulnerability.  It's trying to get intimacy without authenticity, intimacy without vulnerability.  That's what they are going for.  So just think of much of our culture today.  It is based really around people chasing, fake intimacy, surface intimacy, pseudo intimacy, not genuine real connection.  So they long for feelings of intimacy, they are afraid of true intimacy.  So bar room environments, lots of laughter, lots of fun, lots of storytelling, lots of warm emotion.  Everybody feels like a buddy, but nobody's talked about anything of any significance.  The conversations only went a millimeter deep.  You think of team sports.  You have a shared goal.  Everybody's striving together for the shared goal.  They are in the same struggle.  You experience victory, defeat together, the hard work, the coming together, laughter, a family environment.  It feels so close, so connected.

But nobody talks at a deep level.  It's the feelings of closeness without the actual authenticity and vulnerability.  And that's what happens often in many military settings in gang type of settings.  You are in a shared goal, shared conquest, shared struggle.  Everybody's coming together.  Everybody's feeling close, acting close, but there's no true, deep intimacy.  Then you get people that come together with a shared common interest, a shared trauma, a shared goal, a shared hobby.  They bond over one topic.  They connect over being able to open up about one topic.  Sometimes when they open up about that one topic, it goes deep.  It gets raw.  It gets real.  There's emotions involved.  There's vulnerability in one area.  There's coming together, shared goals and desires and passions in one area.  You go, we are so close.

But that's only in one area.  That's only one part of you.  You do not know the rest of the person.  So it creates strong, intense feelings of connection, but only around one area.  So I hope what you realize is surface connection, pseudo connection.  Yes, there's a place for it.

But it's meaningful to a degree.  It gives good warm feelings, but it's not true connection.  It does not satisfy the deepest, longings of the heart.  It's not based on true authenticity and vulnerability.  It's based on hiding.  It's based on not being authentic totally.  So what again, I want you to understand is we all need deep intimacy.  We all need true connection.  Surface connection is great in superficial friendships and casual friendships, but we need a soul meet.  We need close friends where there's total authenticity, where there's ability to be totally vulnerable, where there's acceptance, where it's safe to do all of that, where we are understood, where people get us.  We share all parts of life, intellectual, emotional, relational, spiritual.  That's what we need to get healthy.  And so in recovery, it becomes very important to at least try to find one person that you can begin to gradually build towards deeper and deeper intimacy, deeper and deeper connection.

Now, you have to be careful because a lot of people they go to physical intimacy too quickly.  And all of a sudden they go, oh, we got physical intimacy, we are really close, we are in a relationship.  And they forget all about the other forms of intimacy.  Really work at I want to have soul intimacy.  There has to be getting to know each other, a deep knowledge, shared experiences, talking about a broad range of things, sharing all kinds of difference emotions.  Then, as we do that gradually over time, there's this growing sense of connection and intimacy.  That's where the focus needs to be.

So, I need to add this, for some people who basically as a child and complex trauma say, intimacy always results in pain.

Therefore, forget relationships.

But they still have a desire for connection and intimacy.  And so what they then do is discover, usually by a fluke, that if they connect to certain activities, it gives the feelings of intimacy.  It releases chemicals in the brain that make you feelings of connection.

So, what we have learned is when people engage in sex or watch porn, releases oxytocin, releases dopamine, releases serotonin.  Those are the chemicals of connection.  And so people now go, who needs relationships?  I can just do these activities.  And it gives me the feelings of connection.  And that seems to satisfy others.  They get that through eating food.  Others, they get that through shopping.  They get that through playing video games.  Some even find it in drugs and alcohol.  And so the point is this.  Our brain is driven to find deep connection.  If you are not going to find it in human relationships, it will find it in activities.  It will find it in things that produce the same chemicals.  The problem is, is that without the true connection happening, those chemicals do not satisfy.  Those chemicals give you a thrill for a little while, but leave you empty again, because your deep connection needs are not being met.  And it sets a person up for addiction.  It sets a person up to pursue sex, porn, gambling, food, shopping, video games.  I just need more.  I just need more.  I just need more.  And then they become addicted.  So again, healthy connection is what living is about.  It's what recovery is about.  It is such an important aspect of life.

Let me take you to the next characteristic.  And that is people with deep shame issues coming out of complex trauma have jealousy issues.  So shame is convinced that if you get in a relationship, your partner is eventually going to find somebody better than you.  That there's a whole lot of fish in the sea.  And shame believes I am not a very important fish.  There's a whole lot of better catches out there than me.  That's the bottom line belief of shame.  So shame believes that if I am in a relationship, it proves that I am lovable.  If I am not in a relationship, that must therefore give proof that my shame belief is the truth.  I am not lovable.  Anyway, it's no me has rejected me.

Therefore, if I am in a relationship, I must not lose that relationship.  I have to hang on to that relationship to continue to convince myself that I am lovable, to solve my shame is what it's really trying to do.

But there's another component that comes out of complex trauma that feeds into jealousy.  Most people with complex trauma, children, it's not just that they lived in an environment where their knees were not met where they did not feel safe.  They were betrayed by their parents.  They experienced the violation of trust over and over again.  Promise is broken.  Parents not being there for them.  Not being able to depend on these parents to meet their needs, to care for them, to nurture them.  And so betrayal trauma is part of complex trauma.  Violation of trust is part of complex trauma.  And so now, when they get in a relationship, they expect to be betrayed.  They cannot trust anybody.  Trust, if you trust somebody, you are setting yourself up to get hurt.  So that feeds into jealousy.  And so what does the person do where they are in a relationship?  They are afraid of losing that relationship because that will prove that they are not lovable.  That will expose their shame to everybody.  They got to keep the relationship together.  So they use fear.  I will make that person afraid of leaving me.  I will make that person afraid of having any other friendships.  Even having relationships with their parents, I will use my anger.  I will use abuse.  I will threaten them.  I will keep them afraid of ever leaving me.  Then I will manipulate them all kinds of different ways to try and get them to never leave me, to continue to stay with me, even though I am not meeting their needs, even though this relationship is not satisfying for them.  I will love bomb them.  I will guilt them.  I will threaten them.  All kinds of different things that we just talked about.  The ultimate for many people, and this one takes time, but it's gaslighting.  I will slowly wear them down so that they no longer trust their own thinking.  They no longer trust their own perception.

But they now trust me more and more to think for them.  They trust me more and more to perceive reality.  So I will do things early in the relationship to say, no, you are not thinking right.  Oh, you did not see that correctly.  And they will start to doubt themselves.  They will start to give me more weight in their thinking, me more weight in their perception.  What I will do is feed shame in a subtle way that they will get to a point where they do not trust themselves at all.  And they trust me totally.  That takes time, but when a person can do that, then the other person probably is not going to leave.  And so jealousy is this powerful negative force that is basically working for mind control, basically working to totally control the other person.  It almost creates these like a pimple or cult type of culture within the home over another person.  So it's interesting to me as I have worked over the years with people with huge jealousy issues, is they never admit to themselves how ugly it is, how damaging it is, how controlling it is, how abusive it is.  They always say, but I love them so much.  I just do this because I want the best for them.  So they cannot admit their own fear.  They cannot admit their own shame and the extents that they are willing to go to try to solve their shame, to try to protect themselves from being abandoned.  They just try to spin it as love.  So the issue what I am hoping you see with jealousy, jealousy tries to make it the other person's fault.  It tries to blame the other person.  Oh, you talk to that guy too much.  Oh, you dress inappropriately.  Oh, you go out so often.  It's always trying to make my feelings your fault.  What I hope you are beginning to see is jealousy is it's my shame.  That's the issue.  It's not the other person at all.  That other person can change in a thousand different ways.  They can do everything that I say they need to do to change.  And I am still going to be jealous because I have not dealt with my shame.  I have not dealt with the belief that I am not good enough that the person will eventually leave me when they really see what I am like.  Because there's a lot of better people out there.  So you got to heal the shame.  The next one is a deep longing for validation.  So we talked about that shame basically is always felt less than not good enough.  I do not have any inherent value.  And so the longing still is there that I want to be validated.

Now, let me just add a piece to this.  So just being in complex trauma where your needs are not being met is a child begins to feel that they are they do not have value.  They are not something's wrong with them.  That's why their needs are not being met.

But many families in complex trauma, they operate it off a belief that the worst thing you could create in a child is pride where the child thinks they are better than everybody.  And so their solution to that was do not validate your children because you might give them a big head.  So never praise them.  Never talk about how great they have done because then your child's going to get a big head and they are going to become proud.  It's a totally wrong understanding of validation.  Validation does not lead to pride.  Shame actually leads to pride.  And so this lack of validation is what caused a lot of people to have even heightened shame because nobody ever validated them and a child needs to be validated.  Then for others they had workaholic parents.  They had angry abusive parents.  They had critical parents.  All of those instead of giving validation they got criticism.  Instead of getting validation they got nothing.  Nobody was there for them.  And so this growing shame inside of them.

But we have a need for validation.  It lets us know who we are.  It lets us understand that we are valuable just the way we are that our personality is just okay the way it is.  That our body is okay the way it is.  We need validation.  And if we are not getting it if we are in an environment that is non-validating we can develop a hyper drive for validation.  Some children they try to suppress it and push it down.  I do not need validation.

But others they go to this hyper longing for validation.  And so it can go in two directions.  Some are just very overt with it.  They are out there trying to get validation.  They try to be the center of attention.  They try to get the spotlight on themself.  They brag all the time and point out and tell everybody how great they are and about all their accomplishments.  They lie and embellish stories and make up stories to try to impress people.  They drop hints all the time about things they have done trying to be a little more subtle but they are just hoping somebody is impressed with them or somebody says wow you are amazing or they get lots of degrees.  Lots of possessions.  They show their greatness through their degrees and possessions to impress people to get people to validate them.  Others are more subtle.  They are not in your face but this can go a couple different directions.  So the first is to me a significant one.  I have had so many clients that every time they get a new job every time they accomplish something the first thing that pops into their head is I wonder if dad will be proud of me.  I wonder if mom will say anything.  They are not going to go advertise it but the longing is there that mom and dad will still validate them and communicate that they are proud of them.  They have never gotten that and even at 40-50 they are still hoping for that.  That shows how powerful this is.  Others they do not necessarily put it out there that they have accomplished stuff but they might hint at it a little bit.  They might just do little things that they hope draw attention to something that they have accomplished or some they just do really really nice things for people and the reason for doing extra nice things for people is that somebody will say thank you.  Somebody will say you are so wonderful.  Somebody will validate them.  So they are not going to ask for it.  They are just going to do things and hope that somebody validates them and that can drive them.  Once they get a few people, when they do nice things and a few people compliment them and praise them, now they can just be driven to keep doing nice things constantly because that longing there's so thirsty for validation.  Now I need to add something here.  Some children did not get validation from their parents.  They had workaholic parents.  They had angry critical parents but they long for validation.  The first thing they got validated for from a friend, from a teacher, from a relative, all of a sudden that created this thirst and they began to do that thing over and over again.  So we talked about this in the last video.  For some it was being funny.  For some it was being good in a certain sport.  For some it was certain hobby.  For some it was their looks.  All of a sudden now they focused on that but what we saw is now they are looking for their value in externals.  Now they always have to pursue only that and they begin to pursue it in unhealthy ways and it actually becomes destructive.  There's another thing that I need to add and that is that some children did not receive any positive validation but they got negative validation.  They got noticed.  They got attention.  They got validated when they were bad, when they misbehaved, when they went against what mom and dad wanted.  When mom and dad got angry and gave them attention, that was a form of validation.  And so to the child it was even negative validation is better than no validation at all.  What often happens with that is they then begin to continue to do what gets them the negative validation.  That then attracts a certain peer group.  Other kids who are in the same boat, they know from a group and they respect each other for how bad they are, for how tough they are, for the trouble that they get in.  And so they validate each other now.  Then for some that leads to now they develop an identity that they are the bad kid, that they are the kid that steals all the time, that lies all the time, that breaks the neighbor's property all the time and that identity becomes something that's respected.  So this can just build in more and more negative directions.  The next characteristic is people with shame become hypersensitive to disrespect.  So if you look at complex trauma and shame it comes out of an environment where you are not treated with respect, where you are neglected, where you are abused, where you are laughed at, where you are criticized, where you are abandoned, all of those communicate disrespect, or you even get you are compared with others.  You are made to feel like you are a burden, that you are a failure, that you are a mistake, all disrespect.  So disrespect is part of shame.  That's what a shame is, I now feel disrespect for myself.  I now feel that I do not deserve respect.  I have to earn respect.

But what is important to understand is that disrespect hurts a lot.  Disrespect spits on my value.  It says I am a zero.  It is like pouring salt in a wound.  Disrespect is a very, very painful emotion because it's a statement about my identity that's very negative.  So for children growing up in complex trauma, disrespect can be verbal, but disrespect can also be how people treat me.  They do not see me.  They do not hear me.  They ignore me.  All of those disrespect, disrespect, disrespect, it is so painful.  And so what happens when a child's in an environment where they are experiencing disrespect every day.  That's complex trauma.  Is the child begins to do a couple things.  Number one, they believe that everybody looks down on them.  Everybody sees them through the eyes of disrespect.  They assume that now.  Secondly, that then means when they go into relationships, they re-disrespect into situations where there's no disrespect at all.  So let me give you an example.  I was teaching at a seminar and afterwards people come up and talk to me and ask me questions.  And so there was a line of people waiting to talk to me and there's a person talking to me.  All of a sudden this person came up and they tried to butt in front of the line and they tried to interrupt the person who was talking to me and they wanted to talk to me now.  And I just very respectfully put up my hands and just serve.  You could just give a minute here.  I am talking to this person and I will get to you very shortly.  That person left in a huff.  That person said to their friend, he just treated me with great disrespect.  All I did was set a respectful boundary.

But because of all of the disrespect they had experienced all their life, they now red disrespect into me setting a respectful boundary.  So that is what happens all of the time with children coming at a complex trauma.

But then it does a third thing.  Now if I sense disrespect, there's a powerful, intense reaction to stop it, to fight back.  And so if I sensed respect, it could be true disrespect or it could be disrespect that I read into situations where it's not even there.  Now I am going to lash out.  I am going to get angry.  I am going to disrespect the other person.  I am going to do all I can to hurt them worse than they are hurting me.  So shame creates this powerful reaction every time that disrespect thing gets triggered.  And wow, that can do a ton of damage in relationships to children, to partners, to friends.  That is the problem with this hypersensitivity to disrespect.  You read it in to where it's not even there and then you overreact and do a ton of damage.  That leads to the next one.  Shame also is hypersensitive to criticism.  So these are connected.

But a child where shame develops is often been criticized verbally by being made to feel they are not good enough by not being seen, by not being heard, by being laughed at, by being teased, all kinds of different things.  Many children grew up in families where it did not matter how well they did, how hard they tried, it never was good enough.  Their parents always found something to criticize about it.  They always came up short.  Now most of us, if I know I have done something wrong that violates love, I can accept criticism because I know it's designed to help me.

But boy, when I am doing my best, when my heart is pure and I am still being criticized, it hurts like crazy.  It feels unjust.  It feels wrong.  It feels I cannot win.  It causes deep pain.  It's very discouraging.  And so again, criticism like disrespect hurts a ton.  And we develop this powerful reaction.  Every time we sense that it's coming because what criticism is doing is exposing our shame.  It is putting out for all to see how bad we fear we are.  And so people, when they sense that criticism is coming, they can overreact.  They can get very angry.  They can lash out because they never want to look bad again.  The problem is, is that they redefine what is a criticism.

So, whenever somebody gives them a different opinion, they, they, you are criticizing me.  No, I am giving you a different opinion.  Whenever somebody gives you feedback in a situation, you are criticizing me.  You are trying to make me look stupid.  Whenever somebody points out a legitimate mistake that you have made, you are criticizing me.  When somebody is trying to even be helpful in a situation, you are criticizing me.  And so what begins to happen is they go, they develop a belief that for you to not criticize me means that you must never disagree with me.  It means that you must never call me on my stuff.  Even when I am doing stuff that violates love, that's clearly wrong.  In other words, if you are not totally for me and agree with me 100%, then you are against me.  Loyalty means that you will never criticize me.  That's how they begin to frame it.  That's how deep their shame is.  That they cannot look at themselves honestly.  They cannot have others look at them honestly.  They cannot see any of their flaws.  They cannot get any other opinions or help.  They must be 100% right all the time never challenged.  That basically moves people into narcissistic distorted thinking.  And that does so much damage in relationships.  The next one is what happens with shame is image becomes more important than reality.  So what shame believes and concludes is that if people get to know the authentic me, they will never love me and accept me and respect me.  In other words, based on my internal world, which is not good enough, I will never get love acceptance respect and my needs met.

Therefore, the only way to get love respect and get my needs met is by creating an external world that people respect my image.  So all the focus then goes to creating the perfect outward external world that they think people will respect, cause them to like them, then cause them to want a relationship with them, then cause them to meet their needs.  So the image, what they present to the external world now becomes all important.  So they have to act perfectly, they have to be impressive in how they look, what they own, performance, they got to control all of their external world in order to get acceptance.  Then if they have children and many of the clients they work with have experienced this when they went old in public, they had to be dressed to the nines, they had to behave with all the right manners, they had to show lots of affection to themselves.

But behind closed doors, it was a totally different story.  There was anger that it was it was chaos.

But in public, you had to be the perfect family because that's how you got respect.  So the bottom line again is this, people cannot get to know the real me.  We got to keep a big part of our life a secret and only let people see what we want them to see, what we can control, what makes us look good.  Do you realize that that creates constant insecurity, constant fear that this host of cards that you created just might collapse, it feeds shame.  And if something goes wrong, boy, that could mess up everything.  So this whole image issue is big for many people because the alternative has become authentic and that is super scary.

But that is really what recovery is about is becoming authentic.  The next one is shame results in many insecurities.  So shame basically begins to feel the need to hide parts of yourself that were rejected.  So I got to hide my personality.  I am an introvert.  I got to hide parts of my body because I got teased for that.  So now what happens if I cannot hide some parts of me, I cannot hide my body.  I feel insecure all the time about my body.  What happens if parts of me that have been hiding from my personality come out.  So I start crying or I get really sad or I get angry or I show fear.  Then I get really insecure because I got punished for those before.  I got made fun of for those before.  And then what happens if the things that I turn to to try to make me feel secure, to try to make me feel important like my body, like my job, like my money, like my possessions.  What happens if something threatens them so I get older and I start losing my looks and I start losing my body and my figure.  Or I come up to retirement and I am going to lose my job in security, in security, in security.  So shame produces many insecurities.  In securities about every aspect of you that has been criticized, made fun of, that you have rejected and hated about yourself, things that you have built to try to build security in your life, but are actually things that could be threatened.  All of those cause a person of deeper insecurity.

But there's a second piece that comes out of complex trauma.  What is it that causes child to feel security?  It's not just having a secure external environment.  It's having a rock to firmly connect to.  Mum and dad who are safe, who are reliable, who are trustworthy.  When a child has a rock, they can have an external or that's not totally secure, but they still feel secure because they are connected to the rock.  So what happens if you cannot connect, you feel insecure all the time?  Complex trauma produces insecurity at that level as well.  Then if they have a major failure in their life, they work away at something and fail, that creates insecurities.  Then if they are abandoned, that creates deep, deep insecurities.  So they can get insecurity from all kinds of different sources.  That comes out of shame and complex trauma.  The final one is they promise more than they can deliver.  So shame basically says that people will not love me and respect me for who I am, just the way I am.  The only way they will respect me is if I seem bigger than I am.  So I need to promise more than I can deliver.  So the bigger they can make them self, the more they think they are going to be liked and accepted.  So let's promise the moon to everybody.  Let's promise that, oh yes, say yes to everybody, I can do this.  Let's build ourselves up, make yourself look really big.  They set themselves up to disappoint people because they cannot deliver.  They are not superman.  And often they end up making all these promises and spending all kinds of time trying to wiggle out of those promises because they know they cannot do it and making excuses for why they cannot do it and still try to save face.  So people from complex trauma with deep shame often end up promising more than they can deliver.  So that's shame aspect.  I hope it just fills out your thinking that of how complex trauma has affected you, that you can begin to spot some of these areas in your life and go, oh yes, I can see now that that's not healthy, that ultimately feed shame, hurts relationships, hurts me, I want to change.  Okay, that's the end of another week.  Thank you so much again for being here.  We will see you next week.  Have a great week.
