How do you know if you are in the family scapegoat role?  That's what I will be talking about in today's episode of Beyond Family Scapegoating Abuse, so stick around.  Hey everyone, welcome to my channel.  I am Rebecca Mandeville, psychotherapist and certified clinical trauma professional, and the author of Rejected, Shamed, and Blamed, Help and Hope for Adults in the Family Scapegoat Role.  And I wanted to first thank all of my subscribers for your kind messages after the loss of a family member.  It was very moving for me.  I was not expecting it.  And the sensitivity shown in the comments made me feel privileged that I get to do these videos and meet all of you.  And we all have so much in common.  You may notice you are having a more expansive view of my office.  And that is because I moved a table into another part of the house and forgot I needed it.  And it's definitely a lot easier now, right?  I wonder what I want and all sorts of opportunities to come back with.  So I thought, well, you know, there's some symbology here because part of what I am doing in sharing my experiences, as a clinician, as a researcher on what I call family scapegoating abuse or FSA.  I am hoping to broaden and expand your perspective, not only to have better clinical in your dysfunctional or narcissistic family, but also to give you a sense of hope that you can expand beyond the scapegoat narrative, that damaging false narrative that sticks to you like feather onto tar, and you can expand beyond the pain, that deep soul pain, of being the scapegoat in your family of origin.  That does not mean we do not feel the pain at times, but knowing that we cared enough to feel something, that we have enough humanity to feel sad regarding missed connections, or lost connections, or connections you may have felt you never ever had.  And those of you who may have come across the clinical term attachment trauma, you may have an early sense of missed connection, so to speak, and attachment trauma, betrayal trauma, those are all a part of the trauma.  And that trauma is a part of the trauma that we have, along with complex trauma, of what I call scapegoat trauma.  I will be defining that in more detail later in a future video article, perhaps even a new book.  And that's the term I am using along with family scapegoating abuse is scapegoat trauma.  Scapegoat trauma is a result of experiences in your family of origin.  And in my book, I listed 16 experiences that I have experienced in my family of origin.  And in my book, I listed 16 experiences that I have experienced in my family of origin.  And I will be defining those experiences because I do believe that the different types of experiences common to FSA survivors, and these are research-based, I did not just pull these up out of the air, or make them up, or, oh, it happened to me, so it must be happening to everybody.  I have been doing various types of qualitative, that means someone's lived experience.  Sometimes we call that feminological research, qualitative research.  And that is what supported my introductory guide on family scapegoating abuse when I introduced the term.  So let's get to the 16 experiences common to survivors of family scapegoating abuse.  Number one, you may identify as being codependent or highly sensitive and empathic.  You may have the fawn submit response to avoid conflict or people pleasing.  Alternatively, you may have no problem setting boundaries and will defend yourself without hesitation if you feel you are being disrespected or violated in some manner.  And when I say response, I am talking about trauma responses.  I saw all of the trauma responses within the.  Not only my work with clients, but in my FSA research.  Two, you may have difficulty expressing your feelings because at a very young age, you learn to be careful about revealing too much of yourself as it would be used against you by family members.  You may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, and so on.  And you may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are heartless, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, and so on.  And you may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, too sensitive, heartless, selfish, dramatic, narcissistic, stubborn, et cetera, by a scapegoating parent when you did attempt to express your honest emotions and experiences even when you were very young.  And then I added here, as a result of stuffing down or repressing your feelings and natural responses, you may experience various physical ailments or struggle with addiction, codependency, anxiety, and so on.  And you may have been told by a parent or other family member that you are cold, unloving, insensitive, anxiety, depression, or obsessive compulsive behaviors.  Three, you are made to feel solely responsible for the quality of your relationship with a parent, primary caregiver, dominant sibling, or others in your family.  If there are problems in the relationship, it is viewed as being your fault, no matter what.  Four, you have been labeled a liar, crazy, mentally, or, and, or, I should say, emotionally ill by one or more family members.  And that can be part of the scapegoat narrative that family members get inoculated into and then adopt, as I have said in other videos, the shock of death of a parent and then the same ideology, propaganda is coming out of the sibling's mouth.  And you are shocked because you did not realize the siblings had actually bought into that narrative about you.  You may have distanced, this is still part of number four, you may have distanced yourself from select relatives as a result of continued character assassination.  Many of you know that as a smear campaign in an attempt to protect yourself and minimize personal harm.  Five, one or more.  Family members have been physically, sexually, emotionally, or mentally abusive towards you, including gaslighting you.  That can also, I call that reality distortion.  It can be that as well.  For example, denying, distorting, there I said it, and twisting events to show themselves in a better light at your expense.  And it's really important to remember that if a family member has sexually abused you, either when you were, if it was a sibling, when your children or a parent or step-parent, someone brought into the family, that person who sexually abused you has a vested interest in portraying you as a crazy liar to the outside world.  It works out very well for them.  So they might, even if you do not know it, behind your back might be at least more likely to think that somebody hurt their автомобile.  Because we know that this máquinal guy here, Erzőny, something very unusual, that one of her friends, his mother, who would have never settled down with herta engine.  Has an opinion towards someone.  Her mother was a vessel for the Scorpio, and she knew 그때 they were going to siècle, they would have dealt with erzőny.

But no one even knew of herpreneurship, right.  So this is kind of, would you say, imagine that right?  So for example, like maybe it's mainly attachment.  And you have been sexually molested and then you tell, you need to be discredited in case or when you did that.  So this can be quite calculated.  In no way would this fall into any kind of unconscious scapegoating.  Someone has something to hide.  Something needs to be covered up.  There's a secret.  And so not only has the child been molested in some fashion, but they now are being portrayed as someone who's not what we call in therapy land, a reliable reporter.  Probably the police use that as well.  Are they a believable reporter, reliable reporter?  So there's a, a conscious intentional need to make the abused family member, the unreliable reporter.  And that would go not just for sexual abuse, although that's where I can see it, where the campaign starts very early on in a child's life, but it can be also from emotional and mental abuse and physical.  So imagine what that child's going through.  And those of you who have been through it, you do not have to imagine it sadly.  Six, nuclear or extended family members, or even non-family members were informed by a parent or primary caregiver that you were a troubled problem child and were difficult to deal with and not to be trusted or believed.  That is also another way that a parent, sometimes it can be a grandparent, dominant, troubling, most often a parent.  Again, another way to discredit you if you were to ever spill the beans on how you are being treated in terms of being psychoemotionally abused, that invisible abuse and family scapegoating abuse is indeed invisible psychoemotional abuse.  Number seven, if you try to inform others within or 07 08 09 family of the abuse you are experiencing as a child or years later as an adult.  You are not believed and the abusive family member will deny their behavior, again, often via the smear campaign, whereby you are once again a liar or somehow mentally, emotionally defective, again, not a believable or reliable reporter.  Eight, your parents may have objectified and dehumanized you in various ways.  For example, you were told you were difficult or you were made to feel incompetent and not good enough.  You may have been maligned by a parent to others, including in your presence.  Again, it's a myth that scapegoating only happens behind closed doors.  Maybe that's true for narcissistic abuse.  I do not know, but I can tell you beyond a shadow of a doubt, it will happen right in front of you.  Example, parents saying when Janie's in the room, Janie was such a difficult baby.  She has so many emotional problems and this might even happen with friends you bring home or dates.  Nine, you may be accused of faking a genuine illness or injury by one or more people in your family, nuclear or extended.  Again, that can get wrapped up into the scapegoat narrative and now that tumbleweed or snowball is bigger and bigger, collecting more.  Data, so to speak, to supposedly support your being somehow defective or problem in your family.  And I do have a little passage on that, number nine in my book about faking, being accused of faking illnesses or injuries by family members.  And I have a video here.  So if you click on the video tab, look from my homepage, there's a menu on the top and click on the video tab.  Or look through my playlist on the homepage and you will find a video called you are faking it.  Ten, you blame yourself for any relationship difficulties you experience as an adult, fearing that there is something innately wrong with you and that you are somehow damaged and defective.  Well, why would not you?  Because you have been told that your whole life.  Well, I mean, some of you, your whole life.  It is you.  It's always you.  You know, this is such a no brainer and such an obvious thing to say.  And I am sure all of you have thought of this before, but think about it.  If you were physically assaulted by a family member, you would be believed, hopefully by an outside entity that you reported this to, or secondly, you would be supported with the physical assault with bruises visible.  That everyone can see.

But when you are a victim of this type of psycho-emotional abuse, invisible abuse, you can even be told by family members that you must have done something wrong and you should apologize to the person who in fact abused you.  This is why I call family scapegoating abuse.  One of the most horrific forms of abuse.  And I think that's one of the most serious forms of abuse that anyone could experience, especially a child.  And it just gets piled on more and more usually into adulthood, except in families where it's like musical chairs.  Someone's a scapegoat today and the golden child today, and then they switch chairs and now you are the golden child and they are the scapegoat.  And that's a whole nother video that we will get to at some other time.  11.  You feel uncomfortable around your family of origin, separate, different, not part of.  12.  You feel trapped in a role of some kind, feel stifled and constricted in your interactions, a sense of having to walk on eggshells.  You may feel your soul is in a vice and being squeezed.  13.  You may feel you are not able to relax and feel like your true self did a couple of videos on that, by the way, recently.  14.  Around your family member, this feeling of dis-ease lack of ease, dis-ease disease might translate into areas of your life, resulting in your feeling like an outsider.  This might in turn cause you to behave in ways that contribute to your sense of social isolation due to being unable to trust others or take interpersonal risks.  And so many scapegoated adults who, even if they have figured out what happened to them, I get a lot of people writing me saying, I get it.  I understand it.  I accept it.  Thank you for your work.  And I am going to probably isolate and keep to myself for the most part, the rest of my life.  And I understand that.  I also want to say that I know if you would want to, and you may not want to, you can push through that.  You can work through that.  And again, expand beyond that.

But it's something you would really, even if you did not want to do it, you might realize maybe you need to do it.  We are social creatures.  We do tend to do better when we have community or at least a few people we feel care about us and that we care about.

But I do not push my clients on that.  I just invite them to imagine that it's possible.  Or as an old Tai Chi teacher, that's hard to say, Tai Chi teacher used to say to me, to the class really, believe nothing, entertain possibilities.  So that's what I say to my clients.  Twelve, you may have difficulty forming healthy attachments and trusting, loving connections, and you may blame yourself for this.  You may be attracted to addicts or alcoholics, narcissists, abusers.  You know it's unhealthy, but continue to make self-damaging relationships.  And I think that's what we should do.  And then I think that the other thing that's really important is to understand what you are doing.  And I think that's what you are doing.  And I think that's what you are doing.  And I think that's what you are doing.  And I think that's what you are doing.  And try not to beat yourself up for that.  If that's what you have discovered, it's very understandable.  That family conditioning is like an imprint.  And remember your neural pathways developed around that.  And if your scapegoating started very young and you were in a high stress or addictive or high conflict, you are going to have to be able to get out of that.  And if you are in a high stress or addictive or addictive or addictive or addictive or addictive or addictive or addictive or addictive household, your neural pathways were developing around that.  80% of the brains developed between the age of four and six.  The good news is you can develop new neural pathways.  And that's the gift of some of the recent brain research, brain science and the findings there.  And that's why I have affirmation videos on my channel.  There's three now.  And again, look in the video section or on my Facebook page.  And I will see you in the next one.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Bye.  Trauma-informed, not always, not with everyone, but for some.  So watch out for that.  And there is trauma-informed meditation out there now.  You can Google it.  So those types of things might help a little, but not much, unless the healing professional understands you are in fact an adult survivor of child abuse, some kind of child abuse, psycho-emotional abuse.  They get that.  They see that.  They are able to recognize it as a clinician.  Fifteen, your family minimizes or ignores your personal or professional accomplishments.  No matter how highly regarded you may be outside of your family of origin, you might be considered an expert in your field, for example, or have a unique talent that's recognized or enjoyed by others.  To your family, you are essentially a fake.  You have somehow managed to fool everyone, by pretending you are something that you could not possibly be, such as successful, healthy, high-functioning, respected in your profession, et cetera.  And this, of course, may continue to your experience of imposter syndrome.  So I have a video about that too, and it's an oldie but goodie.  And it's probably one of my most popular videos, but it's bizarre realities.  The Mind Bending Reality, Scapegoated Adults Experience.  So number 15's in there, so you might want to take a look.  And last but not least, and I know there's more than 16, and I am going to ask you actually to share ones you would add in a moment.  16, you may have had no choice but to reduce or limit contact with one or more family members to protect your own mental and emotional health.  Sometimes physical.  I have had adult clients come to me who are being physically assaulted by siblings, for example.  So it's not always psycho-emotional.  You may question yourself for this decision.  You may feel guilty, bad, wrong for distancing yourself from your family.  Nuclear or extended family members may openly state to others that you deserve to be an outcast and take no responsibility for their part in the dysfunctional interactions or for your pulling away from the family system, particularly if their actions towards you were overtly or covertly abusive.  And if you broke contact, of course, then you are selfish.  You do not care about family.  And all of that now is rolling into the scapegoat narrative.  So that is a 16.  This VaultOS version 2,112,112,321.  We could figure out just exactly how many people had a i-sampleorar⁠—on ,show or by an otherwise— hatten이셨 Speaking 1-2,616.  I thought we could figure it out because it was just a ged, Puck instantlyessions Rule!  Following on from that.  Okay.  So we have this.  So if you feel you need to be cautious because of that, please do be.  I hope you got something out of today's video, even if you have already read my book.  And if you have, thank you.

And I have not been here quite as much the last few weeks because all kinds of things going on, including now a huge 100-plus pound dog of mine blowing out their knee.  So when it rains, it pours.

But I was really looking forward to getting back here in front of all of you today.  And I am so grateful for this community that we are forming.
