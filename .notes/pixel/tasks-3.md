### Next Steps

1. Start with HIGH priority items (analytics, authentication, database)
2. Focus on core platform functionality before advanced features
3. Address module resolution issues to improve overall compilation
4. Test each category systematically after fixes
5. Validate FHE encryption operations in isolated environment
