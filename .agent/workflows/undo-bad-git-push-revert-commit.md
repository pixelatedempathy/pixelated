description: Safely revert a pushed commit without breaking history
---

1. **Find the Bad Commit Hash**:
   - Identify the commit that caused the issue.
   // turbo
   - Run `git log --oneline -n 5`

2. **Revert the Commit**:
   - Use `git revert` to create a *new* commit that is the exact opposite of the bad one. Replace `[hash]` with the actual commit hash.
   // turbo
   - Run `git revert [hash]`

3. **Push the Fix**:
   - Push the new revert commit to the remote repository.
   // turbo
   - Run `git push origin HEAD`

4. **Pro Tips**:
   - If you haven't pushed yet, you can just use `git reset --soft HEAD~1` to undo the commit locally.
   - `git revert` is safe for shared branches because it only adds history, never deletes it.
