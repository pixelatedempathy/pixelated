July 2016. A cancer patient from the Netherlands is being taken to the hospital in Mönchengladbach. Joke K. has cancer. Two days later she is dead. The case is starting a debate that has been going on until today. Because she was treated by a German healer with a dangerous chemical. He played with the lives of people. I find that really unbelievable. The patients could not say no because they did not know the substance and thought, well, I can hurt according to the motto. Healers associations say it is a tragic case. But is that true? We want to find out more about healers and their therapies, which are so popular among many. I think that's a good thing. It's good that more is focused on the body, on the human being and that you can see the whole thing. We healers, we go with nature, because nature has developed everything. Like a doctor, healers are allowed to treat diseases. Do you need something of it? There is no regulated training. They are really in danger because they do not know, do I meet someone who knows exactly where his limits are or do I meet someone who tells me, what I can do in terms of what most people think about me, but if there is almost no idea that they live in the world, then no, because the patients do not know where they should be. You can see that the way we 셋 here in this institution are one where there are people try to fight the Iraq alot more than they really could and this is what they can at the moment. relação als держhilfe Joke K. trusted the German health system and paid for it with her life. The Dutch woman was always healthy and sporty. But in summer 2016 she discovered a knot in her chest. Cancer. For Joke K. the diagnosis was a nightmare. She had to witness the fight against the disease with several friends. Now she feared to lose him too. And that her children would grow up without a mother. We have recreated these scenes. Joke's husband André doesn't want the pictures of his mother to be forgotten. But we can see the pictures of his family on TV. The children should not be remembered for their mother's death in this way. He gives us an interview. But he doesn't want to be recognized. André remembers the day when the drama started as if it had happened yesterday. We went to the hospital and the doctor told us there were chemo, radiation, hormone therapy and surgery. What is this? That's it. He was sitting behind his laptop and didn't even look at us. The laptop said so. You have to do that or you will die. You have to do this or you will die. Joke refused therapy from the Dutch doctor. Instead, she trusted a German healer. How did it come about? We drive to the Netherlands. Near Genderen. There we are meeting two people who knew Joke well. Her brother-in-law and her friend Stefanie Niezing. Together they helped her husband André and the children through a difficult time. They are well informed about what happened. They have read Joke's medical records and her medical notes on all treatments. Would those people still live? Yes. Here, sodium biturate. What is all that? Why did Joke refuse a medical standard therapy that can heal over 80% of all breast cancer patients today? What Joke said was that she didn't want to have a traditional treatment. Joke said she definitely didn't want chemotherapy or surgery. Because she saw too often in friends and acquaintances how much people suffer from the treatment and the medication and then die anyway. With these fears, the doctors left Joke alone in the hospital. This is what her family sees. When the doctor gave the diagnosis, Joke asked a few questions. It was about nutrition and about alternative approaches. But the hospital immediately gave up. But she didn't get any answers. The hospital refused to talk about it. She didn't feel heard. She had real questions and expected real answers. I actually want real answers. I think she had the feeling that she wasn't taken seriously. She had the feeling that she wasn't taken very seriously. Joke is a doctor. Jutta Hübner knows that many patients are like Joke. She is a specialist in cancer medicine and has another special field. Natural healing and alternative healing procedures. A rare combination. With the support of the German Cancer Aid, she advises patients at the Jena University Clinic who, like Joke, after a cancer diagnosis don't know how to proceed. She엌 is in flavor,till you're ready. Joke is in the wherever she is, euros, が. Joke. Joke is in the matter.生. There are an incredible number of messages about what you can do. I think it's very difficult to distinguish between what is serious and what is not, especially as a layperson and now in a very exhausting situation for you. All cancer patients have fears and questions. Many want to do even more for their health besides standard therapy. But the few doctors take the time to get involved, says Hübner. I'd love to. Maybe we'll see each other next weekend. Bye! Time is money. And especially listening to the patient is hardly invested in talking. It is invested in devices and expensive instruments and drugs. But the immediate time between doctor and patient has been reduced to a minimum. And that's not a deficit of school medicine. It wants to talk. But that's a problem of our system and we have to change that. What school medicine doesn't do, many people look for in the around 47,000 paramedics in Germany. On average, 128,000 patients a day give them their trust, estimates the German Paramedics Association. What's different there than at the doctor's? After a long search, we find a paramedic in Bottrop who allows us insights into her work. So, hello Bärbel. Yes, hello. Welcome to my practice. I made a tea. It's fennel, anise, cumin. Relax. Yes. My parents always drank it, every day. Elisabeth Volke mainly has time for conversations. I think it's good that we focus on all people, on the whole system, that not only one symptom is treated and that we try to understand it all at once. And that strong drugs are not used immediately. You called me today and you have allergies. Do you have a cough or what are your current complaints? My eyes are dry, my nose is totally closed, I can't breathe and I'm totally tired. I think that's somehow this ... Bärbel has been to doctors, but she tells us that she couldn't help her. She is a private practitioner. That's why the health insurance company pays the appointment with the healer. The first conversation with Elisabeth Volke takes over an hour. It's often just a few minutes at the doctor's. People also need time to open up and just put their concerns on the table and tell me, actually I have other problems. And I have a lot of patients who have this problem. I have a lot of patients who sit with me and cry. And I think that's what the patients need. Joke would have needed someone who takes her concerns seriously from the start. But her husband tells her that she didn't find an open ear in the clinic. That's why she was looking for an alternative. She wanted a gentle, natural cancer therapy. And found it on the Internet, on Klaus R.'s homepage. The German healer was specifically targeting Dutch patients. Stephanie Niezing shows us the websites that Joke found back then. The healer has deleted everything, but the Internet doesn't forget. The websites are saved in the web archive. Why Germany? In the Netherlands there are... We find that healers in the Netherlands are not able to find patients. They are not allowed to treat cancer. Unlike in Germany. Klaus R. informed about this on his website. And about his alternative cancer therapy. A blessing for the patients, it seemed. Effective. 100% biological. That was exactly the treatment that Joke was looking for. Did you always get to know him? No, only in court. Yes. But he was always in the White Kittel. He just sold himself like a doctor. Even with his surgery... Joke knew that she had chosen alternative medicine. But I think she and her husband believed that he was an educated doctor. Someone with a medical background. That's what he showed on the website. If you appear like this in the Netherlands, with a white kittel and a stethoscope, then you are a doctor. Then I'm a doctor. Many people in Germany also consider healers to be an alternative to a doctor. But can you really compare the two professions? How do you become a healer? On the Internet, health offices and healers schools inform about the requirements. Who wants to become a healer must... be at least 25 years old, have a primary school degree, and have a medical examination at the health office. This includes a multiple choice test and an oral practical examination. The relevant healer should show that he does not pose any danger to public health, i.e. his patients. The training is not regulated. There is neither intermediate examination nor performance test. But there are offers for the healer in the self-study program. Those who decide to do this learn at home alone. Self-study costs less than getting a driver's license. The most expensive training is the one in the private schools. Lawyers who are willing to spend more money visit one of the numerous private schools. Paracelsus is the biggest chain. In Karlsruhe we can take a look at the training. A healer prepares the students for the examinations at the office doctor. They only learn medical basics. The alternative procedures, with which they later mainly treat their patients, are not tested by the state. For their future, these students have different plans. I have noticed that there are also other ways, such as school medicine. I found it very exciting, especially with plants and herbs. There are alternatives, so that you don't always have to use these wooden hammer methods. What do you have in mind after the exam? It should be more like coaching. And in any case holistic. Because I am of the opinion that body, mind and soul are important. And I am of the opinion that body, mind and soul are important. And I am of the opinion that body, mind and soul are important. That everything has to be healed and not just the body. Because only then does a disease arise when the soul is ill. And that even applies to lung inflammation? The body reacts. As soon as something is in imbalance, it shows some symptoms. And then you just have to investigate where it comes from. The students are supposed to learn here above all to recognize serious diseases and to send the patients to the doctor immediately if necessary. Nevertheless, the German health system gives them enormous privileges. If the students pass the exam at the health office, they are almost allowed to diagnose and treat sick people, even cancer patients. A health practitioner certificate suggests a controlled medical training. But the teaching of health practitioners has nothing to do with it, says Annette K. She used to teach at such a school herself. The only thing she qualified for was the health practitioner certificate. Annette K. fears problems with her former employer and therefore wants to remain anonymous. For me it was a very important thing. For me it was indeed so, I have to say now in retrospect, that it was really well-read, well-suited knowledge in self-study that I passed on. Nothing from practice, nothing that was checked by an external position. Afterwards I read a lot more for the teaching position than I would have needed for the health practitioner certificate. But that does not change the fact that I have never really seen this disease. The German health system is also a source of information. The German health system is a source of information. Even at the Paracelsus school, the relevant health practitioners do not see real patients. And now disinfect again. Exactly. Very good. On a Sunday, these students practice how to lay infusions. Diplomated nurses need additional training and the guidance of a doctor. Health practitioners do not need all this. They are also allowed to put syringes. If you perceive this here, then it basically means that the infusion is going wrong. It is not a scientifically funded training at all. And through this, the state-tested, it is somehow suggested to people that there is content behind it. But that's not the case. Most health practitioners do not offer their patients any classical medical therapies later, but the most different alternative procedures. For example, the treatment of the patient with a syringe. For example, syringes. These practical courses at the Paracelsus school are voluntary. Syringes are good against pain and tension, explains the professor. And also presents another technique. Gua Sha. This part is made of buffalo horn. It has a very round edge and by pressing and pulling, this effect arises on the skin. Hold a little bit again. The shabetechnik Gua Sha causes bleeding under the skin. This is supposed to help against various diseases. So things like rising colds, where you have the feeling that I was just wet and cold and I come home and I freeze a little, frost. You can get that out of it very well, because it is an expelling procedure. De-poisoning, expelling. Treatments like Gua Sha and syringes are part of the standard in Germany. But do they also work? To find out, we drive to Cologne to the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health. Independent scientists here assess the use of drugs and therapies. Jürgen Windeler is the director of the institute. He has been intensively engaged in procedures that have been used to treat the problem of skin disease. The first step is to find out what the problem is. He is also intensively engaged in procedures that apply healing practices. For the doctor and scientist, there is only one scale in his work. Can the effect of a therapy be proven or not? I brought you something. We show him what we saw in the healing practice school. To take out the stadium a little bit. De-poisoning, expelling. Treatments that can also be learned from experience and experience a natural therapy is quite a test. Imprisoned skin, fixed skin and milk can also be treated through the skin therapy. The results of the therapy are minimal. After only about 24 hours of expelling with a mixture ofalalic complexước What I can really try to read is whether or not it will work. He can apply the вмole and some com포els. And what is the effect of this ethep Medication nutritionist willй Wir zeigen ihm auch die Verfahren, die Heilpraktikerin Elisabeth Volker anwendet. Wie viele Heilpraktiker nutzt auch sie ein Pendel. Damit diagnostiziert und therapiert sie Krankheiten. Das Pendel schwingt von oben nach unten. Und ein klares Nein. Bei Nein schwingt es zur Seite. So signalisiere der Körper der Patientin, was er brauche, erklärt uns die Heilpraktikerin. Brauchst du davon irgendwie etwas von diesem Mittel, das sich in der Tasche befindet? Ja, okay. Du gehst nach und nach mit dem Finger, und ich frage dann einzeln nach. Elisabeth Volke möchte aus 200 Mitteln das richtige Medikament auswählen. Und nutzt dabei die Medikamente, die sogenannte synergetische Homöopathie. Brauchst du davon irgendwie etwas? Nein. Die Rute sagt Nein. Diese Methode hat eine Heilpraktikerin entwickelt. Es gibt naturheilkundliche Verfahren, die auch gut unterstützt sind, die gut gesichert sind, die man durchaus nehmen könnte. Und dann gibt es Verfahren, die sind kompletter Unsinn. Das darf man auch in dieser Klarheit so sagen. Und dieses Verfahren gehört dazu. Das ist kompletter Unsinn. Und Mediziner sagen auch zu Homöopathie, dass das Hokuspokus ist. Das kann man gar nicht nachvollziehen, dass das alles wirkt. Aber wenn ich dieses Mittel finde, also der Körper findet, weil der sagt, ich brauche das, dann ist das das Richtige, was ich gefunden habe. Und die Patienten sagten mir auch oft, das hat mir geholfen. Doch was genau hilft den Patienten? Du bekommst jetzt Luesinum. Pendel und homöopathische Kügelchen? Oder eher Zeit, Zuwendung und der Placeboeffekt? Könnte es nicht sogar sinnvoll sein, bei leichten Erkrankungen genau darauf zu setzen? Jutta Hübner hat den Placeboeffekt untersucht. Auflösen. Der Placeboeffekt wird ja von vielen Ärzten auch als eigentlich das Positive an der alternativen oder komplementären Medizin gesehen. Da hat es bei mir so einen Punkt, wo ich komplett angefangen habe, umzudenken. In dem Moment, als wir gezeigt haben, das haben wir mehrfach gezeigt in Studien, dass Menschen, die in so einer Bagatell-Situation erleben, die Globuli helfen mir, der Heilpraktiker hilft mir, die Edelsteine auflegen hilft mir oder irgend so etwas, auch in der ernsthaften Krankheitssituation dann dazu neigen, zuerst dieses zu tun. Das kann etwa beim Coronavirus gefährlich werden. Im Internet finden wir diese Werbung. Sie verschwindet schnell wieder. Denn meldepflichtige Infektionskrankheiten dürfen Heilpraktiker nicht behandeln. Doch Birgit Eberle bietet weiterhin an, Viren, Bakterien und Allergien zu löschen. Das Einzige, was man dazu brauche, seien Holzscheiben für 35 Euro. Wir lassen uns die Scheiben schicken. Die Heilpraktikerin hat die Methode selbst entwickelt und wird mit den Tätigkeiten von den Heilpraktikern aus der Heilpraktikern-Konzerne und den Schamanismus-Konzerneinrichtungen in der Heilpraktik-Konzerneinrichtung verantwortlich. Sie ist bereit, mit uns über ihr Verfahren zu sprechen. Hallo. Aufzeichnung läuft? Jawohl. Super. Dann fangen wir einfach an. Wenn ich jetzt zum Beispiel Heuschnupfen löschen möchte, was mache ich dann? Die Patienten, die haben dann zu Hause diese Scheibe oder die drei Scheiben. Setzen sich auf diese Scheiben drauf. Und halten dann mit ihren Händen die spezielle Handhaltung, sodass diese Information eben in der Zelle gelöscht werden kann. Wirkt diese Methode auch gegen das Coronavirus? Also für mich ist es egal, ob das jetzt Epstein-Barr-Virus heißt oder HIV heißt oder Coronavirus heißt. Es geht nicht um die Erkrankung und nicht um die Erkrankung, sondern es geht um diese Labordiagnostik, sage ich jetzt mal. Sondern es geht um diese Informationen, die in diesen Begriffen stecken und die dann das System krank machen. Alles, was halt durch Viren, Bakterien oder Allergien negativ im System sich äußert. Das kann therapiert werden. Solche erwiesenermaßen unwirksamen und damit nicht effizienten Tests, die sich in der Heilpraktik bewegen, sind nicht nur für die Heilpraktiker eine Ausnahme. Und damit riskanten Methoden sind bei Heilpraktikern keine Ausnahme. Viele Schulen bieten zwar Kurse etwa zur Akupunktur an, bei der eine Wirkung belegt ist, aber eben auch zu Astrologie und Schamanismus. Ich glaube, die Esoterik an sich erkennt man relativ flott. Wenn da steht Astrologie, Reinkarnation, das ist jedem klar. Was ich eigentlich kritischer finde, ist, dass es in der Heilpraktik nicht so viel ist, wie es in der Psychiatrie ist. Es gibt auch pseudowissenschaftliche Sachen, die von dir drüber kommen. Wie Irisdiagnostik und Dunkelfeldmikroskopie und Stuhlproben. Oder diese ganzen Tests mit Nahrungsmittelunverträglichkeiten. Wo suggeriert wird, es ist irgendwie eine Untersuchung, bei der was Anständiges rauskommt. Also mir fällt das auch schwer herauszufinden. Ist das jetzt etwas Echtes? Oder ist das jetzt irgendwie was Erfundenes? Das gelang auch Joke nicht. Nachdem die Niederländerin die Diagnose brachte, suchte sie nach einer seriösen Alternative zur Chemotherapie. Auf der Webseite des deutschen Heilpraktikers Klaus R. las sie von einer Krebsbehandlung mit 3-Bromopyruvat. Es klang wissenschaftlich. 3-BP, so die Abkürzung der Substanz, sei eines der effektivsten Krebsmedikamente, hieß es. Zu Risiken oder Nebenwirkungen fand sie es. Sie war aber nicht der einzige, der das nicht gemacht hat. Sie war nicht der einzige, der das nicht gemacht hat. Sie war nicht der einzige, der das nicht gemacht hat. Zu Risiken oder Nebenwirkungen fand sie nichts. Joke wollte es genauer wissen. Sie telefonierte mit dem Heilpraktiker, der ihre Bedenken zerstreute. Das Mittel sei nicht giftig für gesunde Zellen. Es könne allenfalls leichte Nebenwirkungen verursachen. Joke entschied sich schließlich für die Therapie. Und hoffte. Sie dachte, dass das nicht die richtige Lösung wäre. Sie hatte aber eine gute Idee. Sie hat sich dann mit einer Frau in der Pflege in der Pflege eingeladen. Sie hat sich dann mit einer Frau in der Pflege eingeladen. Sie hat sich dann mit einer Frau in der Pflege eingeladen. Sie dachte, dass sie in guten Händen ist. In den Niederlanden kann man sich nicht vorstellen, dass jemand ohne Ausbildung so etwas darf. In Deutschland ist doch alles geregelt. Es gibt sogar ein Reinheitsgebot für Bier. Es gibt sogar ein Reinheitsgebot für Bier. Kurz darauf fuhr Joke für ihre Krebstherapie zu dem Heilpraktiker nach Deutschland. Es waren Ferien. Die ganze Familie kam mit. In Brückenbracht am Niederrhein lag die Praxis von Klaus R. Er war in der Pflege. Er war in der Pflege. Er war der Behandlungsleiter des Heilpraktikers. Jeden Vormittag wurden Joke und andere Krebspatienten in diesem Gebäude behandelt. Jeden Vormittag wurden Joke und andere Krebspatienten in diesem Gebäude behandelt. Ein Labor gab es nicht. Der Heilpraktiker stellte die Infusionen in seiner Küche her. So wie in dieser nachgestellten Szene. So wie in dieser nachgestellten Szene. Die Chemikalie 3-Bromopyruvat nannte er Glukose-Blocker. Die Chemikalie 3-Bromopyruvat nannte er Glukose-Blocker. Das klang natürlicher. Wird er später vor Gericht sagen. Das klang natürlicher. Klaus R. had explained to Joke that his treatment would work better if he had not done chemotherapy before. So Joke, let's take the pressure. And already finished. The glucose blocker would starve her cancer cells, the healer had explained to her. Joke was top-fit, she had not yet received any treatment. She started with full hope. And then so much goes wrong in such a short time. What exactly happened to Joke and other patients was reconstructed in a complex criminal case in March 2019 at the Krefeld district court. The individual guilt of the accused Klaus R. is the cause of the trial. But at the same time, the trial also makes the fundamental problems of the healing practitioner's profession clear. We accompanied the trial for four months and spoke to all the participants. We also ask Klaus R. for an interview. He first says yes and then lets his lawyer say no again. In the process, he sets out his treatment plan. His cancer therapies took ten weeks. The patients had to pay almost 10,000 euros for them. The chemical 3BP was the center of the therapy. What kind of substance has the healing practitioner Joke and other cancer patients used? The treatment was done in a very difficult and difficult way. The treatment was done in a very difficult and difficult way. In the court's hearing, the legal practitioner and toxicologist Thomas Daldrup is supposed to find out. The bottles and tubes that Klaus R. used are still stored in his institute. I have an infusion tube here. The legal practitioner knows that 3BP is an aggressive chemical. In many cases, the treatment is not effective. In many tubes, he finds the excess of the substance in an extremely high dosage. A hard chemotherapy has actually been carried out. But the patients could not say no because they were misled, in my view, because they did not know the substance. And thought, well, I can hurt after that. If you had said that this is a highly reactive substance that is made of synthetic materials, I think everyone would have said no, I don't want it. So from my point of view, it was a very severe deception that was made. Healing practitioners are not allowed to take prescription-free drugs. But other substances do. The toxicologist finds out that the chemical 3BP is not allowed as a drug in any country in the world. And that's why Klaus R. was allowed to use it legally. Studies show that the substance was actually tested for its effect against cancer. Researchers had administered rat-raising doses of the drug. The animals were able to consume small amounts without any problems. But with higher dosage, the rats suddenly all died. During the process, it turns out that the accused Klaus R. knew about these alarming animal experiments. Nevertheless, he deliberately increased the dosage for some patients. As I understood it in the trial, he probably thought it was a good thing. Maybe I'll have better results if I give a little more. He just tried it out. He experimented. He played with the lives of people. I think that's really unbelievable. I think it's really unbelievable. It also shows that the scales of the healing practitioner were not suitable for weighing drugs. For that, you need such a scale of precision. But Klaus R. didn't know that. Thomas Daldrup demonstrates to us how inaccurate the scale of the healing practitioner was. There was one place missing behind the comma. Here it was about weighing 50, 60, 70, 80 milligrams. That doesn't work with this scale. Most of the time, it's a potato scale, where you can roughly measure the weight of a bottle, but not milligrams. So this scale is completely unsuitable for the production of medicinal herbs. On July 27, 2016, Klaus R.'s practice went a little dramatically wrong. In his kitchen, the healing practitioner prepared the infusions. Later, it turns out that they contained extremely high concentrations of 3 BP. Three patients were given infusions. Joke was treated for her breast cancer. The other two suffered from gastrointestinal cancer. At first, everything was as usual. But as the chemicals flowed into her body, Joke suddenly became sick. The other two patients also fought with nausea. They all had the medicine well tolerated before. One patient eventually lost the infusion. He was diagnosed with a stroke. In an interview with the police, Joke's husband André tells what happened. When I arrived, she wasn't well. She had already broken out twice or three times. I then took her to the caravan because she wanted to sleep. The doctor told me that she had been in a coma for two weeks. I then took her to the hospital. She was in a coma for two weeks. She had a stomachache. She had a headache. I gave her a pill. She couldn't sleep well all night. The next morning, I asked her if we were really going back to the hospital. That's what she wanted. That was the last thing she said. After that, she didn't say anything. When we arrived, Klaus was already there. He saw Joke and her condition and said that he wouldn't give her any more 3 BP. He said something had gone wrong and no one would get 3 BP anymore. Joke had to go to the toilet. She went in the wrong direction. She was not sure, as if she had been drunk. She probably couldn't do it anymore. She was just sitting there, in her pants. The symptoms indicated brain damage. But the paramedic didn't recognize it. Instead of calling the emergency doctor, he suggested a recipe for a Bach flower drop. We then went back to the campsite. Joke wanted to sleep a little. I then went to the pharmacy. When I came back, the children were sitting with Joke. The paramedic said that something was wrong. I wanted to give her the drops. You have to swallow them. But Joke couldn't swallow anymore. She had cancer attacks, like an epileptic attack. I then took her out of the caravan, put her in the car and we drove to the hospital in Nettetal. From there, she was taken to the emergency room. From there, she was taken to the bigger Maria-Hilf-Klinik in Mönchengladbach with the ambulance. When Joke arrived in the emergency room, she was hardly able to be spoken to. The doctors found out that she had had an infusion with 3 BP at the paramedic. But they didn't know the substance. As you may have heard, she was diagnosed with poisoning. She was in a very serious condition. She was in a very serious condition. From the beginning, it was a very serious illness. And it was already clear that everything could happen here. We gave her medication against the cancer attacks and ultimately put her into an artificial coma on the evening of the day of the appointment. Joke was on the intensive care unit for two days. The patient was diagnosed with a stroke. The substance had reached the brain. A swelling was spreading more and more. The family and the patient are not allowed to make any accusations. They grab every straw. And if someone says, I have a medication here, I can maybe save you, you are of course ready to do anything, even if it is not tested. You just pay a lot of money and hope, of course. As doctors, we are of course very surprised when we prescribe a drug. It can be tested as well, tested as extensively as it may. But if we prescribe it for another indication, we are directly threatened with a regression and a complaint. As a doctor, of course, one wonders why other rules apply to a paramedic. In Munich we meet the lawyer and doctor Alexander Ehlers. He has been working intensively with the Paramedics Act and its history. The law was introduced in 1939. At that time, in addition to doctors, there were a large number of lenders who offered medical treatment, often with little success. The law should, unlike it initially sounds, provide these paramedics with a rule. The law should, unlike it initially sounds, provide these paramedics with a rule. It was intended that those who practice the paramedics as paramedics could still practice this profession until they were fired from the profession. But after that, it should actually be over. It should be a kind of transition rule to the end of this profession. But to this day, the law is in force and gives paramedics enormous freedom. If we consider that the state regulates the details of the butcher's specialty in extenso, in the master professions, in the question of how a hairdresser has to do something and when the scissors are disinfected, but the paramedics do not pay attention to this, then de facto there is a moment of danger for the population and for the individual patient. Three days after the last infusion at the paramedics, Joke dies. The paramedics are not able to find a cure for the disease. The paramedics are not able to find a cure for the disease. The two other patients who were treated with Joke also do not survive the treatment. Cause of death, three BP and an outdated law. The law is not a law. If you analyze the legal regulations in the European Union or in the other western world, then we find that Germany is the only country that allows a profession that is not adequately educated by the state in this way. And this leads again and again to serious, sometimes fatal, treatment errors. Only the most difficult cases end up in the headlines and in court. Are these really individual cases? We would like to talk to a representative of a paramedics association about this. Several associations ask us for an interview. But no one is ready for it. The explanation is sent by email. A paramedics association is sending us the letter of his association. It is a warning to us. We recommend in this case to make any interview requests in order to not unnecessarily put the professional status of the paramedics in negative headlines. However, there are plenty of them around the process against Klaus R. After ten days of negotiations, it is clear that an overdose of three BP has led to the death of the three patients. The large prison cell condemns Klaus R. He is sentenced to two years in prison for negligent murder. He is not allowed to have a job ban. Because a lot of what the paramedics do is allowed by law. It is difficult to understand for the relatives. He is sentenced to two years in prison for this and has three people on his conscience. Do I want to see him in prison? A real punishment would be more just. I was really shocked. I didn't understand it. And I was also shocked by the system that protects the paramedics almost better than the patients. How can that be in Germany? This is what we are experiencing again and again. That this misbehavior is not justifiable at all. It is not justifiable that nothing results from it, which these paramedics really have to fear. And that is why we are also demanding that the removal of the state-tested paramedics from this special protection zone, which they can all blow with, finally stop. The case has also shaken up politics. At the end of 2019, the Federal Health Ministry issued a legal report. It is about re-regulating the profession of a paramedic. In the statement of the Ministry, there is one question that makes the industry nervous. Is there a fundamental possibility of leaving the profession of a paramedic to be removed in the future? Is even a ban conceivable? Nothing has happened since then. Paramedics are still allowed to treat diseases. Almost like a doctor. Only without training. As long as this does not change, the fate of Joke can repeat itself at any time. undefeatable is You
