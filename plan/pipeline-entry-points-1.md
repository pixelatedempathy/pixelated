# Introduction

This plan outlines the creation of robust entry points for the dataset pipeline. The goal is to enable seamless communication between the six pipeline stages and provide three distinct entry points: a web frontend, a CLI interface, and an MCP connection for agent interaction. This plan incorporates project guidelines for structure, UI, and frameworks.

## 1. Objectives

- Establish robust communication between the six pipeline stages.
- Develop three entry points:
  - **Web Frontend**: Internal interface for managing the pipeline.
  - **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool for setup and operation.
  - **MCP Connection**: Integration for agent-based interactions.
- Ensure modularity, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## 2. Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Pipeline Communication

1. **Define Communication Protocols**: Establish data flow and communication standards between stages using `ai/dataset_pipeline/`.
2. **Implement Communication Logic**: Develop and test the logic for inter-stage data transfer.
3. **Validate Communication**: Ensure seamless data flow through unit and integration tests in `tests/ai/`.

### Phase 2: Web Frontend

1. **Design Frontend Architecture**: Use Astro and React to create a simple, intuitive interface for internal use. Follow `src/components/ui/` patterns.
2. **Develop Frontend Components**: Build components for managing pipeline stages and monitoring progress. Use TailwindCSS for styling.
3. **Integrate with Backend**: Connect the frontend to the pipeline communication logic via API endpoints in `src/pages/api/`.

### Phase 3: CLI Interface

1. **Define CLI Commands**: Specify commands for pipeline setup, execution, and monitoring. Use `scripts/` for CLI logic.
2. **Implement CLI Functionality**: Develop the CLI tool with robust error handling and logging.
3. **Test CLI Operations**: Validate the CLI interface with real-world scenarios.

### Phase 4: MCP Connection

1. **Define MCP Protocols**: Establish protocols for agent interaction with the pipeline using `ai/api/`.
2. **Implement MCP Integration**: Develop the connection logic for seamless agent communication.
3. **Test MCP Connectivity**: Ensure reliable and secure interaction between agents and the pipeline.

## 3. Deliverables

- Fully functional pipeline with seamless stage communication.
- Web frontend for internal management.
- CLI tool for setup and operation.
- MCP connection for agent-based interactions.

## 4. Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1 week
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks
- **Phase 3**: 1 week
- **Phase 4**: 1 week

## 5. Dependencies

- Existing pipeline stages and their communication protocols.
- Frontend and backend frameworks used in the project.
- MCP specifications and integration guidelines.

## 6. Risks

- Potential delays in defining communication protocols.
- Integration challenges with MCP.
- Ensuring security and reliability across all entry points.

## 7. Next Steps

- Assign tasks to team members.
- Begin with Phase 1: Pipeline Communication.
