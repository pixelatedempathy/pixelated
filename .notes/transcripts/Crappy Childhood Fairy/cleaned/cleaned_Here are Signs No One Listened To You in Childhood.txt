Something that is not talked about enough when we talk about the way early trauma can affect you is the lifelong damage done when children are ignored.  Now last year I started really tuning in to the pattern I was hearing in so many of the letters that people were writing to me where their parents did not listen to them or really see them.  And so that kind of treatment and then the kind of problems they were having now as adults in connecting with people and expressing themselves.  And I made a video at the time that just went viral so fast.  So many people related to it.  So I am bringing it back from the archives for you right now so that you can see if you show signs that this happened to you.  If you tend to go into a stress response when you try to communicate your emotions or what you need, it may be that you are showing the signs that you were not listening.  If you are showing the signs that you were not listening, you are showing the signs that you were not listening.  If you are showing the signs that you were not listening, you are showing the signs that you were not listening.  If you are showing the signs that you were not listening, you are showing the signs that you were not listening, you are showing the signs that you were not listening.  So when you are trying to communicate your emotions, you are showing the signs that you were not listening.  When you needed something, when you tried to stand up for yourself, when you tried to set a little kid's boundary, getting ignored and having to figure out everything by yourself as a child, it affects a person.  And kids are supposed to learn how to be in the world from their parents.  Parents are supposed to model it and teach it, how to speak, how to listen, how to interpret other people's actions.  And parents are supposed to help their child learn how to express themselves in a way that works, that gets heard, that's clear, that's polite, that's assertive when it needs to be, you know, to say what they need, right?  To ask questions when they are confused, or to say no when something crosses their boundaries.  Did you learn that at home?  There's a whole lot I did not learn until much later in my life, how it's supposed to work.  You know, attentive parents are very connected to the kid.  They listen and they coach them.  And if they are giving feedback, but not listening, that's not going to help.  Some parents are not even saying anything and they are just not really there or they are literally not there.  So if that's what happened to you, it would not be surprising at all if social situations are really stressful for you as an adult.  It's hard to have confidence in yourself when the way you relate to people had to be invented by a little kid, not by the well-adjusted grownups teaching you, but by you.  Without parents who have lived with you for so long, you are not going to be able to do anything.

And so, if you are not listening to you, your social development can end up having big holes in it.  You know, chunks are missing.  And of course, you are going to struggle sometimes as a result of that.  So what are the signs that someone was not listened to as a child?  One is you may get anxious and angry when you try to put feelings into words, especially with people who you depend on, like an employer or a teacher or a partner.

Now, maybe you have repeated a pattern and unconsciously chosen people who are not listening to you.

But if you are not listening to them, you are not going to be able to get what you need.

And so, you are going to have a lot of fear.  You are going to have a lot of fear that you are going to be dismissed or ignored or belittled or not heard, that your voice comes out angry.  That's a sign.  And as you have probably noticed, getting wound up and angry when you are trying to say what you need tends to ruin your chances of getting what you need.  Walking into interactions, you know, so sure that you are not going to get what you need can be a self-fulfilling prophecy.  You can actually become someone who is in fact hard to listen to.  And this is a horrible feeling because you are trying to connect and say what's going on, but then you are also feeling shame that you cannot seem to do it right.

So, it's a double whammy.  And this is really normal for people with childhood PTSD.

But you might be someone who goes the other way.  Instead of getting angry or anxious, you might lapse into fawning and people-pleasing.  You are so sure you will not be heard or cared about that you try to manipulate a good outcome.  And this is a powerful way to get out of that situation and to get away from it.  You could be fawning by dancing around and proving how nice you are and how helpful you are and how many questions you ask about the other person and how they are feeling.  And of course, this ends up not getting you heard either.  Fawning feels like you are being nice, but to the other person, it can feel uncomfortable, like claustrophobia, like something that's not really real.  So while it may have helped you survive childhood, it could be keeping you in relationships that are superficial.  It could be something that someone can be friends with or fall in love with.  It's a performance.  It's like putting a wall up.  Another sign that you may have noticed is that group dynamics are overwhelming for you.  That happens to people who were not listened to as kids.  You feel like you get overlooked.  You do not get your turn or you worry you are not going to get your turn.  Or you feel like everyone else is taking up all the space in the room and all the opportunities to say something and you get resentful.  You feel pushed out.  That's a horrible feeling too.  And it's also one of those dynamics that can be made worse when you feel anxious and angry going into that group setting because you can end up seeming defensive or aggressive or not emotionally safe for other people to be around, huh?  It's understandable that you got this way.  You had to defend yourself and fight to exist, and you probably had to hide a lot of anger.

But the thing is, when you are hiding anger, healthy people can sense it.  Their nervous system is sensing your anger, but you are forcing a smile and saying everything's fine.  And they will perceive you as something's off, as untrustworthy.  Something does not feel right when you say one thing but feel, you know, give off a vibe of another.  So if you have been having a rough time being connected with people and you feel like you have done such a great job of being cool and nice and agreeable, you may want to ask yourself if you are suppressing anger.  Anger, both the negative and the negative.  Anger is a very powerful thing.  It's a very powerful thing.  So the repressed kind and the kind that's totally out there and, you know, being expressed is the hallmark behavior of someone who grew up not listened to.  It makes people mad.  Maybe you only express yourself when you are crying.  The feelings come out as tears.  That's a sign.  Or maybe you only express yourself when you are so angry you cannot take it anymore and you are yelling and banging things around.  Or maybe you just get frozen in silence, shutting people out.  And I am not saying you should run around telling everyone why you are so angry all the time.

But in the long run, if you do not find a healthy way to express anger or express what's bothering you before it becomes anger, you are putting a big strain on your relationships.  Okay, there are also non-angry just communication style things that people do when they were not listened to as a kid.  What do you do in a conversation where there's a long silence?  Does it make you really uncomfortable and make you feel like you need to have to rush in and say something?  Because that often comes from a deep fear that if somebody is not talking, the other person is about to abandon you.  And it's this reflex like, well, hold on.  I will keep talking.  No, wait, no pauses.  Do not go away.  Like you have to keep them connected to you before they get away.  And very similar to this is talking too fast.  I used to talk too fast.  I had to consciously work on slowing that down.  And you might think I talk fast now, but you should have heard me before.  And I was just insecure.  And I was trying to not take up too much of the other person's time basically with my needs, which I thought would be perceived as stupid.  Like, I am so sorry.  I am saying something, but I will make it really fast.  So you will not have to deal with me for long.  And of course, it's stressful listening to someone who talks fast.  It does not make you think, oh, what a considerate person giving me extra time.  Coping mechanisms are always just crap at getting the results you are trying to get, right?  Another sign you were not listened to as a kid is that you get overly intense when you are saying something, especially if you are saying, something about feelings that someone hurt you or, oh God, that you need help with something because you are afraid you will not be helped and you might not even be believed.  You know, that's the fear.  So I used to do this every time I got sick.  And I would say to my boyfriend at the time, well, I am sick.  And he would go, oh, okay.  And I go, no, I am really sick.  Look, my eyes are glassy.  I think I have a fever.  I feel awful.  My stomach hurts.  And I go into this big story, this big list of problems so that I could be believed.  And I was already believed.  And the irony is because I was talking so much about my symptoms and going over and over them, making such a big deal, I kind of ended up getting perceived as a hypochondriac.  And it sounded like exaggeration.  And actually exaggeration is something that people do when they were not listened to as kids.  Also bragging.  When I was a kid though, the one thing that would bring my mother to my side was when I was sick.  And I do not think I ever faked it, except maybe to skip school sometimes.  I mean, who did not do that, right?

But to this day, I can still get very, you know, weird and prickly when I am sick because I am anticipating, you know, there's just this lingering defensive fight in me about, you know, I am sick.  So do not even think of ignoring me.  It's a fight about whether they are going to take care of me or believe me.  And it's kind of like birthdays.  I still, it has gone pretty well for a few years, but it used to be very easy to feel that no matter how much anyone tried, I was just so sure they did not really care and that my birthday was a nuisance to them.  And first, I felt guilty for having the birthday.  And then I felt mad that they had not made a big enough deal.  And, you know, trying to talk through complicated old fears and resentments like that is what we call processing.  And you can process some of this stuff to death.  And it's not a good relationship thing where you are looking to someone else to fix you and they try, but of course it does not fix you.  Anger and anxiety can also be called fear and resentment.  And I have techniques for releasing that.  And I am using those, as you may know, if you have tried my daily practice techniques, they are always linked below.  I will mention that at the end.  When you have fear and resentment, you might repeat yourself, or you might start talking louder and louder, kind of verbally bullying someone so that they keep listening, whether they want to or not, whether they feel that you have answered your concern or not, you might start interrupting them because you are so afraid that you are not being heard.

Now, if you were not listened to as a kid, you might even get angry or defensive.  When people ask questions, for clarification, it's like, well, what do you mean?  What do you mean?  What do I mean?  Or, you know, they go, what?  Could you say that again?  It's like, how many times do I have to repeat myself?  Because of the filter of your past trauma that overlays everything, you think they are challenging you.  Or maybe because you know, your anger is going to create problems.  You start acting like the class clown, like, I know you do not want to listen to me, but maybe I can entertain you and get my point across with humor.  And you are thinking, then you will not think I am an angry person.  And along the same lines, you might hedge what you are trying to say.  And you say, well, I do not know, maybe it's just me, but I do not actually like being treated rudely.  Or maybe it's just me, but the tablecloth is on fire.  I do not know where I got that except, well, Christmas, two Christmases ago, my brother-in-law introduced us to the woman he is now married to.  She's very cool.  She came over and it was Christmas time.  And I would set up this beautiful, decorations on the dining room table.  We ate at the kitchen table, but the dining room table, it had candles and this like woven Norwegian table runner.  That's traditional.  You know, my mom's Norwegian.  It was beautiful.  There was all this stuff and little, little ceramic houses.  It was so charming.  We are eating dinner.  And all of a sudden I hear this crackling.  I was like, what?  And I go into the dining room and I look and it's like, the dining room is like massively, the table is on fire.  It's reaching up to the ceiling.  And I was like, ha, ha, everybody get in here.  And I really liked my future sister-in-law because she was so cool about it.  And she thought it was funny.  And she helped me get like some blankets and put the fire out.  And it was fine.  The table's slightly damaged forever, but whatever.  The house did not burn down.  That was how I made a first impression on her was causing a house fire.  Anyway, one classic childhood PTSD behavior is over self-disclosure.  Was that over self-disclosure?  No, that's a perfectly appropriate story for this.

But you tell me, you tell people too much about yourself too soon or at an inappropriate time, like their mom just died.  And instead of giving them some empathy, you tell a long story about what happened when your mom died.  And I know that's intended as a way to feel connected and show that you do understand, but it's a telltale sign that listening empathically was not something done enough for you, right?  In childhood.  Not being cared about, not being heard can leave a residue of fear and resentment.  And sometimes people who are carrying a lot of those feelings just shut down, you know, just, and this can create a different problem where you feel like you have to sit and listen to someone who's talking too much to you, or they are insulting you, or you are interested, but you cannot see a way to get up and leave.  And this is a fawn response that turns into a freeze response when what you need in that situation is a flight response.  Just fly out of that conversation.  Yes, thanks.  Bye.  Ha.  So the irony is that after all this time wanting to be heard, it can be really weird when someone does listen to you.  This used to actually make me feel dysregulated.  And when I think about it, it still sometimes does.

Now, four or five years ago, I got to meet Pete Walker and he's a therapist.  He's like such an important person.  I got his advice.  He's the person who wrote the book, See PTSD from Surviving to Thriving.  And he's the one who came up with the concept of, Emotional Flashbacks and Abandonment Melange.  Two names for things that I had been experiencing all my life, that having the name was life changing.  Like when somebody names something, when they give you a name for it, you are like, it's a thing.  I am not crazy.  It's a common symptom.  And I talk about these more deeply in other videos, but emotional flashbacks and abandonment melange.  So I was just starting to coach people.  This was four or five years ago, and I needed some help knowing where to set a boundary when people were out there, asking for my help, but they seem to be a danger to themselves.  You know, and I am not a therapist or doctor, and I wanted to know, like, how do you gracefully handle that?  And his advice was great.  And he told me exactly when it was time to refer someone to a hotline or licensed professional.  And, you know, let me off the hook.  Like, do not, I do not even have to try to do that.  I do not have to try to like save somebody's life on YouTube or somewhere where I do not even know where they are.  And I will forever be grateful for his clarity about that.

But, oh my gosh, Pete Walker, has presence, man.  When he's listening to you, it's intense.  I mean, he is like fully listening.  And next thing you know, I could not feel my hands.  I was totally dysregulated.

Now, not to fawn, but is it just me?  Do you get dysregulated when somebody really listens to you?  Every time I spot an odd thing like that, a trauma symptom, it's an opportunity for me to be able to open, open it up.  You know, like what's in there?  What's in that box and face it and free myself from it using my tools or mostly free myself from it.  I am always a work in progress.  So this was back when I first started Crappy Childhood Fairy.  And if you look at my really old videos, not only do they have, you know, terrible low sound levels and problems with color and camera focus, but you will see that I say, , and , and every 10th word, and I am sort of flopping around screen like this, and I would be editing my own videos and I would just go, oh my gosh, I cannot put this up on YouTube.  I had to, you know, but I was dying inside.  And so what I did is I went to Toastmasters and I got really into it to teach myself to speak impactfully.  And I got the insight that saying , and like, and so all the time, which I still do sometimes, but they are called filler words.  And it's just another way of trying to keep someone interested the hard way.  It's actually okay to hold, hold, a silence.  See what I mean?  Like you stayed with me for that, right?  Saying , has the opposite effect of looking unprofessional or looking like whatever I am going to say is not that important.  It squanders people's attention.  So another thing that squanders the attention someone gives you is not to listen to them because you are so busy thinking like, what am I going to say?  What am I going to say?  What am I going to say next?  Oh, I know I said this.  And then you wait, you wait, you wait for them to finish their sentence.  And you are like, yes, I know.  And that's a, that's a thing people do.  When they were not listened to as kids, strategizing got to get this right so that they do not leave the conversation.  So it's all right.  It's, it's not your fault.  You were neglected as a kid.  You deserve to have wonderful connections to people now and to become fully yourself and to express yourself.  So your life can take shape around who you really are.  Childhood trauma can really damage a person's ability to connect with people and to communicate authentically.  So luckily there's, there's, there's so much you can do to heal and change even now, even if you are in your fifties or your sixties, your seventies or later.  So if you want to use those techniques to release that fear and resentment that kind of drives you to have difficulty connecting with people and dealing with that wound of not being listened to, I have got a free course for you called the daily practice.  These are the techniques that I have used for 29 years to keep releasing fear and resentment and continue to heal.  And you can download that free course right here.  Click there.  And I will see you very soon.
