I wanted to be perfect in it, not to be perfect and to first recognize that what I'm feeling right now is shame. Then you have to throw all of that overboard again, because the true magic only arises when you let go. And you don't let go as long as you're a perfectionist. Today I want to share my thoughts with you on the subject of showing yourself vulnerable, perfectionism, shame and dealing with it. Simon is not at the start today, so let's see how structured the whole thing will be. Simon is the more structured one here. I just love to tell it off and then I would say let's see where we end up. And I want to start with my story with perfectionism. I used to always think that perfectionism is actually something good. It also makes total sense because it is a protection mechanism and a protection mechanism always has a benefit. In every protection mechanism and also in every negative belief in everything we teach ourselves about our childhood to survive, to be able to live. To be able to get through in any form is also a benefit. There are a lot of learnings in there. There are virtues in there that we have learned from it. In this respect, it is definitely valuable. It is just something that you can at best let go of in adulthood. So that you say you just take what you have learned from it, from skills, out. They stay with you, you can continue to use them, but you don't always have to drive up this protection mechanism, so to speak. You have to say, I'm going to do it. You can't be a victim of this protection mechanism anymore, but you can then also shape freely how you want to deal with situations in life. I have been following social researcher Brené Brown for a long time. She also has a very nice special on Netflix, which means Call to Courage, and has also written a lot of great books. And she has researched a lot, a lot, a lot about these topics. Shame, vulnerability, perfectionism. It all comes together. Because when we are perfectionist, it is a protection mechanism that is supposed to protect us from showing ourselves in our vulnerability. And I made a post about it on Instagram, I would like to read it to you. That was this trend. Hi, I'm Hannah and I'm not ashamed of it. Point, point, point. And I said, Hi, I'm Hannah. I'm Hannah and I'm not ashamed of it. Shame me. But sometimes I do that and that's okay too. Social researcher Brené Brown has been researching shame, vulnerability and perfectionism for over ten years. Her most important insight was that shame is universal. We all experience it, but hardly anyone speaks about it. And that's exactly what makes her so powerful. Because shame is not just something embarrassing to me. Shame sits much deeper. Shame doesn't say that was stupid, but I'm stupid. And that hurts a lot. Because it affects our self-esteem and gives us the feeling of not being enough. And there was a protection mechanism with which I tried for a long time to avoid it. Perfectionism. I used to hope that if I do everything right, I can protect myself from shame. But the opposite has happened. Perfectionism has only made my shame louder. Because no matter how perfect I was, it was never good enough. Brené Brown says so beautifully about it. Perfectionism is often confused with the desire to give our best and to unleash our full potential. But in reality, the opposite happens. Perfectionism prevents us from really giving our best. It is not a driving force for growth, but a shield against shame. Instead of improving us, it blocks us. And then I shared three things that helped me deal with shame, or to take their power. Especially when I just realize, yes, I just have the feeling that I am vulnerable. And then perfectionism comes up. The desire to control the situation in some form. That is also behind perfectionism or a protective mechanism in general. The attempt to control a situation in which I am not feeling safe right now. But we actually can't really do that. But it is an attempt. It is super, super smart that our system has mechanisms that have helped us for a long time. It's great that it exists. It's just, as I said, at some point in our adult life, at a certain point in time, it's no longer helpful. And one thing that always helps me a lot, and that has also helped me deal with shame, is to listen to myself first and to recognize at first that what I am feeling right now is shame. That it is something that is very, very deep. Which, as I said, is universal. What every person knows. But I don't think that is often felt that way. Because we often believe that shame is like, yes, I am ashamed because I am embarrassed. That's not what I mean. But what I mean is really this shame. That is this, that is this deep pain, this fear of not belonging to it. To be rejected. This fear of not being good enough. And that is such a deep feeling of shame. And that helped me first to reflect on it for myself and to name it that way. And to express it. Ah yes, okay. Yes, I am ashamed right now. And as it is, when we name things, we often take a lot of their power. That's why I started talking about it. Also with my friends, with my environment. And to share that. And now also here with you. Because, as I said, that is something absolutely human. Something completely normal. And the more important I find it that we talk about it. And what has helped me a lot and still helps me a lot is self-confidence. Self-confidence. And then of course also confidence in others. But that starts, as always, with one's self. So how I treat myself. That's how I treat others. And the way I treat others, that says a lot about how I treat myself. And that's why self-confidence is a very, very, very important topic, I think. To be as loving as possible with yourself has been a incredibly long way for me. Because I used to, yes, say to myself, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. I used to have thoughts that were almost exclusively self-destructive for many years. And that just happens to so, so many people. And that really means to get out of this self-conceit again and again. At the beginning it was like this for me. I first noticed, okay, ah, there's a perfectionism going on right now. Ah, okay, I'm in this whirlwind of I'm not good enough and so on. But that's just my pattern. Okay, but then came the next step. First of all, self-confidence. First of all, the self-conceit for falling into this pattern again. And that's exactly what I think happens quickly when you start dealing with your topics. That you then condemn yourself for falling into an old pattern again. Or that you are now again perhaps so mean to yourself. Or the condemnation of the condemner. That's such a trick. That's such a trick that can arise. So what I just want to say is that you really make yourself aware that you can simply take this condemnation out. So to get out of self-conceit again and again consciously, no matter in what form. And I have often spoken in the past with perfectionism, as I have often spoken with my inner child. I just find it so valuable anyway to make this inner dialogue aware. And then just to say, to take the step back. And to say, ah okay, so you're telling me now that. Ah okay, but I don't need that right now. But thank you anyway. Because I was very perfectionistic, of course, at some point I wanted to eradicate perfectionism. So I actually never wanted to fall into a perfectionist pattern again. Because I wanted to be perfect. I wanted to be perfect in not being perfect. I also hoped in the past that I could eliminate self-doubts and preferably also negative feelings at some point. If I work very, very hard on it, then at some point it just doesn't come at all. But that's not the way life is. And I also have to say, especially with the subject of self-doubts, so I still work on my self-worth. And it can also be good that this is a topic that I have been working on for my whole life and that's totally fine. But I also want to say, for me it has definitely been an important knowledge that self-doubts are not personal. And that they are bad. So I think maybe I would put it like this. If I have self-doubts and really doubts that I am good enough now, then it is nothing positive. Because yes, I am good enough, just like every human being. That's just the way it is. Period. But to have doubts about what you do in life, I think that makes total sense. So that you question yourself. That you look, hey, what could I have done differently? What could I have done better? What do I want to think about next time? Just to learn. So just to question things to learn from them. I think that's super important and I think that's super, super good. But if you doubt your own self-worth, I personally find that not helpful. That means, for example, when I do something, when I, for example, moderate somewhere. Which I have been doing for many years. Still, it can be that after a moderation I think, ah, that wasn't so good, that wasn't good enough. And really doubt too. Then it is like that. Then it's okay. But it has nothing to do with me as a person. It doesn't make me a less valuable person. I learned to separate that for myself. So my self-worth has nothing more to do with what I do or what I say for me. So my self-worth has nothing more to do with what I do or what I say for me. Or what happens outside. Because it's just something that should always be clear, that every person is valuable. And even if I don't always feel valuable and don't always have the feeling that I'm good enough. So even if I, of course, feel a lack of self-worth over and over again. But is that something for me where I now know, okay, I'm not that good. But is that something for me where I now know, okay, I'm not that good. These are learned patterns. This is just something from the past. Okay, but part of me just knows that this is not the truth. That's just not the truth that I'm not good enough as a person. I recorded a video podcast with my beloved Lizé two years ago on the subject of perfectionism. And I think we talked about it for two hours because she also knows perfectionism very well. However, she also knows it very well. She also knows it from her work because she is a learned tailor. And in the training it was really about shaping the work as perfectly as possible. And that's not that easy because she also said that if you want to make art, if you want to be really creative, then you have to throw all of that overboard again. Because the true magic only arises when you let go. And you don't let go as long as you're a perfectionist. But as soon as you take this protection. Once you take the protective wall down, so to speak, then the true magic happens. Then creativity sprouts and then something wonderful can really come out of it. I also had a very sweet experience with my dear friend Rachel. She is a dance teacher and I danced with her contemporary. She taught me choreography and that's a few years ago. I definitely tried her choreography, her steps as well as I could. And I think that's what I learned. And it was really like this. Whenever I was done with the choreography, I looked at her right away. So I immediately looked at what she was saying. Did I do it right? Did I do it right? Was it all the way it should be? And I did that three or four times. And then I also did it quite often before she said anything. Oh no, it wasn't like that. It wasn't right. No, it wasn't quite perfect. And then she said to me afterwards. You're quite perfectionistic. But you know, in contemporary it's exactly about letting go, because then exactly that is transported, what you actually want to transport. Then your vulnerability comes through. Then your emotion comes through. Then your true self comes through, so to speak. And that's what touches the viewer the most. And I thought that was a very, very nice picture. Because I dance. And I think that's something that everyone who follows me on Instagram knows for sure. I love dancing. For me, dancing is the most beautiful expression of my soul. For me, that's meditation. That's just really something really, really great for me to dance. Always and everywhere where it feels right and in tune. And that's why I thought it was a very, very nice picture. So for, yes, just as a metaphor for life. And when I did the video podcast with my beloved Lizzie two years ago, I also wrote a post on Instagram. I would like to read it to you. I also looked at it. I also wrote about perfectionism. I already notice my perfectionism when writing this text. What if someone doesn't understand me? Or is misunderstood? Or is not interested in what I'm writing here? These are a couple of the fears that are usually behind me. If I share something publicly, then it often costs me to overcome it because it is very close to me. Because I show myself very vulnerable and just so imperfect. And I don't mean that negatively. So if you sometimes think it's somehow easier to do what you love, to express yourself and to show your vulnerability, then I can personally say that it's not. Sometimes everything else is easier for me. But that's okay for me now. And I'm extremely grateful that I can do it here because I don't want to do it any other way. Yes, I've often been afraid of it and I still sometimes don't understand it today. To be misunderstood. And I find it so interesting because I saw an interview by Jay Shetty. He said, well, he had been afraid for a very, very long time. He would have given up at some point because he was afraid of it. And I think that's a very good point. He would have given up at some point because he understood that he had his loved ones who understand him. And I would say I would go one step further. So I think that my loved ones really do their best to understand me. But I don't think that's possible. I don't think it's possible that we understand other people 100 percent because we ourselves can't always understand each other 100 percent. So I'm so busy with the people I love. I'm so busy with the human psyche, with my psyche, so many years already. I love to reflect on it, to look at it in all corners and angles. What does that mean? Where does that come from? What kind of feeling is that? And so on. So I just love it because it's kind of the biggest fascination for me to understand other people and to understand myself. And the realization for me was definitely that it is not at all possible to always understand yourself or others. Because we are fluid beings. We are not always the same. I mean, every person has a cycle. We women have a cycle anyway. We are always different. Depending on the day, depending on the cycle, depending on the life situation, we are in a change. And that's the nice thing, because we are constantly growing. We are developing further and it's just nice that we are not always the same. And I think what is really important is that we want to be seen. And I think that's really important. I think that our loved ones, even if they don't always understand us, see us. I can definitely say that about my loved ones. And I know that's incredibly appreciated. And I'm so grateful for that. And of course that also means that we are allowed to see ourselves. It's always this, we are the only people we can't escape from. We ourselves. We go to bed with ourselves in the evening and get up with ourselves in the morning. And we... We have to get through the day ourselves. Or we are allowed to get through the day ourselves. Because of the death of our daughter in the last two and a half years, I had a very long time where I somehow had to get through the day. And I saw again how, no matter what happens outside, no matter how much support you have, no matter who is there, I am the one who has to go through it. Alone. That doesn't mean that we are alone. So it's the most important thing that we are alone. That's the most important thing that we have our loved ones around us. That's the most valuable thing I think. Nevertheless, at the very first place is the relationship that we have with ourselves. Because that is the one we can't escape from. And I'm just writing a lot here. But what I actually wanted to say is, I think the more we learn to see ourselves, and at every moment, because we are different at every moment. To see ourselves. To accept ourselves. To accept ourselves as we are at the moment. To be loving with ourselves. The more we feel ourselves, of course, actually also seen from the outside. How is it with you? How does perfectionism express itself for you? So it was also in the conversation with Lizzie so exciting that it expresses itself quite differently with her. But the struggle, so to speak, that we feel, is the same. And that we also limit ourselves with it. That's the same, the same outcome. It was very nice with you. It's a bit like tea time. I have my tea here. I've been talking all the time, so I couldn't drink at all. I'm looking forward to your thoughts in the comments now. And please also write which topics you would find interesting for our video podcast. And then I look forward to seeing you next week. Hopefully. Until then. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
