## Phase 02 — Validation & Standardization

Summary
-------
Phase 02 ensures incoming data meets schema, content, and safety expectations and is normalized into canonical internal formats. This covers schema enforcement, sanitization, language/format standardization, and initial quality scoring.

Primary goal
- Provide a validation pipeline that rejects bad data early and normalizes accepted data for downstream stages.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [x] Define canonical internal schema(s) and document mapping rules for each source type
- [x] Implement schema validators and integrate with the ingestion queue
- [x] Add sanitizers for user-controlled or free-form text (avoid XSS/HTML injection)
- [x] Implement automated format converters (CSV/JSON/Audio → canonical conversation format)
- [x] Build initial quality scoring component and normalize scores across sources
- [x] Add a quarantine store for records that fail validation and an operator review workflow
- [x] Create unit/integration tests for each validation rule and converter
- [x] Add monitoring/alerts for validation rate and quarantine growth
- [x] Ensure metadata and provenance tracking for each record (timestamps, source id)
- [x] Provide tooling to reprocess quarantined records after fixes
- [x] Update documentation and runbook for validation rules in `docs/ops/validation.md`
- [x] Ensure any third-party parsing libraries are up-to-date and audited

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components

**Canonical Schemas & Validation**
- [`validation.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/validation.py) - Pydantic-based validation with sanitization
- [`SpeakerTurn`](ai/dataset_pipeline/validation.py) - Turn-level schema with content sanitization
- [`ConversationRecord`](ai/dataset_pipeline/validation.py) - Conversation-level schema with validation rules
- [`QualityScore`](ai/dataset_pipeline/validation.py) - Quality scoring model with multi-dimensional scoring

**Format Converters**
- [`format_converter.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/format_converter.py) - Multi-format conversion (JSON, JSONL, CSV, Parquet, TSV)
- [`multi_format_converter.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/multi_format_converter.py) - Enhanced batch conversion with format detection

**Sanitization & Security**
- XSS/HTML injection protection using bleach library
- Content sanitization with regex validation
- ID/speaker validation with alphanumeric constraints
- Sanitization integrated into validation workflow

**Quality Scoring**
- Initial quality scoring algorithm implemented
- Multi-dimensional scoring (completeness, coherence, relevance)
- Normalized scores across different source types
- Mental health relevance detection

**Quarantine System**
- [`quarantine.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/quarantine.py) - MongoDB-backed quarantine store
- Operator review workflow with status management
- Reprocessing capabilities with attempt limits
- Status tracking (PENDING_REVIEW, APPROVED, REJECTED, REPROCESSED, ERROR)

**Monitoring & Alerts**
- [`monitoring.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/monitoring.py) - Real-time validation metrics
- Alert thresholds for fail rates and quarantine growth
- Integration with validation workflow via logging functions

**Testing**
- [`tests/test_validation_components.py`](ai/dataset_pipeline/tests/test_validation_components.py) - Comprehensive unit tests for validation components
- Tests for schema validation, sanitization, quality scoring, and source mapping
- Integration tests for complete validation pipeline

**Documentation**
- Complete validation documentation in [`docs/ops/validation.md`](docs/ops/validation.md)
- Schema documentation and mapping rules
- Integration guidelines and troubleshooting
- Security compliance section

**Security & Compliance**
- Third-party library security audit completed in [`security_audit.md`](ai/dataset_pipeline/security_audit.md)
- All libraries verified as secure with no known vulnerabilities
- Content sanitization prevents XSS attacks
- ID validation prevents injection attacks

## Completeness Summary

Phase 02 has been completed with all planned tasks implemented:

### Implemented Components:
- **Canonical Schemas**: Pydantic-based models with comprehensive validation (SpeakerTurn, ConversationRecord, QualityScore)
- **Sanitization**: Content cleaning with bleach library to prevent XSS
- **Format Converters**: Multi-format support (CSV, JSON, audio transcripts) to canonical format
- **Quality Scoring**: Multi-dimensional scoring system (completeness, coherence, relevance)
- **Quarantine System**: MongoDB-backed storage for failed records with review workflow
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and alerting for validation performance
- **Security**: Complete audit of third-party libraries with security verification
- **Testing**: Comprehensive unit and integration tests for validation components

### Integration Points:
- All validation components integrated with ingestion pipeline via validate_record function
- Quarantine system handles failed records without blocking pipeline
- Quality scores computed and stored with each validated record
- Security measures prevent injection attacks throughout the pipeline
- Metadata and provenance tracking implemented with ingestion timestamps and source tracking

### What Remains for Complete Integration:
- Performance tuning based on real-world usage patterns
- Expansion of format converters for additional source types as needed
- Advanced ML-based quality scoring models to replace heuristic algorithms

The validation pipeline is production-ready with comprehensive security, monitoring, and error handling.
