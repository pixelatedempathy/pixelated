So that's why many shame-based people, when they feel their relationship is falling apart, they don't just break it off and sit alone for a while.

They don't break it off until they have somebody else ready.

Because they can't be alone because that would prove their deepest fear that they're not lovable.

So here's how it works out.

So you've got shame in the rectangle on the left, the blue rectangle.

Then people respond.

People respond to shame in different ways.

So some people respond by going to the gray oval at the bottom, the inferior position.

I'm a nobody.

I'm no good.

And they just walk around with zero self-image.

Others respond by trying to compensate.

And they act like they're better than everybody.

And they go in the direction of being a narcissist.

Okay?

So what you need to understand is those two people, they're not just trying to find each other, because what does the superior person want to fix their shame?

Not just that I walk around feeling better.

I need people to tell me I'm better than others.

So I need to rescue people.

I need to find people who are messed up and help them out.

Because what do they do when I help them out?

They say, you are so wonderful.

You are fantastic.

And that heals their shame, they think.

And then how does it help the person who feels inferior to stay that way?

Well, there's always a knight in shining armor that's going to come around to rescue them.

And when they come and rescue them, they go, I'm going to give you all my time.

You're worth it.

Here, here's some gifts.

Let me spend time with you and do stuff for you.

And they go, I get so much attention from being inferior.

This is solving my shame.

So it all starts great.

It all starts great.

It all looks like it's going to solve the shame.

Now, just one thing before I go to the next slide.

In the beginning, the superior person sacrifices all their needs for this inferior person.

They make the inferior person the center of their universe.

OK?

But that's about to change.

Because what happens once they do that, the superiors rescuing the inferior, the inferiors feeling rescued and they're both feeling good, but they're not dealing with their shame in a meaningful way.

So they're both discontent at a deep level.

And so pretty soon, the superior person starts to get annoyed with the inferior person and say, why don't you carry your weight around here?

I'm tired of doing everything for you.

And all of a sudden he makes himself the center of the universe.

And the other person has to give up all their rights and needs.

And take charge.

And take care of them.

And then the inferior person, they go, why am I not getting the attention I used to get?

And they start pouting and whining and creating crisis to try to draw the other person back.

And you get more and more tension.

And then the superior person, they start getting abusive.

They start getting controlling.

They start thinking, the way to get all the love that I need is to cut everybody else out of that person's life so I'm the only one left.

Then they'll give me all the love I need.

So they try to isolate them from all their friends and family.

Trying to solve their shame.

And then the relationship is drifting.

It's falling apart.

And both of them start to fear abandonment.

So they can go back to the honeymoon and say, let's try harder.

And let's be on our best behavior.

The inferior person can say, I need to keep them happy.

I've been too demanding, too needy.

I need to do more things for them.

And they become a caretaker.

And they give up more and more of their rights.

But it's not solving shame.

And the relationship keeps breaking down.

What I want you to see is as long as shame is not dealt with, you can never have a healthy relationship.

Shame has to be dealt with to some degree.

And both people have to be dealing with their shame in order for a relationship to have any chance.

Now, you might think, well, är you able to be on on your own over time?

Well, it's a long term worship, it's a supportive worship, right?

It's a non-cheing out to each stands and we live as family.

It's allowable to watch it on at the church level and to the home.

It's really, really important.

What a great role is the relationship and the wiring is needed.

It's a bigimmune.

It holds a structure.

It's a rolling crystal that we're that we live within.

And as you have to get to you an example, let's just say, between you and me, there's a group of people today.

Like when you're with someone, they have that." What does it take to touch?

Well they do help you.

It's a great thing.

much shame as the other one.

They're just hiding it better.

And so at some point, if they don't start to see that they have shame too, they will keep needing the other person to be inferior.

So the inferior person starts to deal with their shame and get healthy.

That messes up the way the superior person wants this to operate.

And they're not getting the applause that they used to get.

So they need to sabotage that person's recovery and make them sick again so they get the praise that they need.

They need to feed the monster.

And it doesn't work.

So here's some of the extreme things that happen.

For the inferior person, they become super needy, super clingy.

I don't want to lose you.

I don't want to lose you.

So all of a sudden they got all kinds of needs.

Some go to a munch house and sit there.

Some go to a bar.

Some go to a bar.

Some go to a bar.

Some go to a bar.

And I keep going to their end.

And everything that happens, all of a sudden, they go to the twenty-three questions that come out of their munch house and give them hope.

They're not just afraid to do anything.

They're like, well, you know, patients, what's that gra mammals doing here?

I've been inhhhh this area for a Bar.

I'm26 meters away from a emergency.

reaching out to people so that they don't get sick and then they're not like, Oh, don't you think you've got a problem.

I'm like, come on.

more sacrifices for you just love me shame trying to get a solution but it never works for the superior person they can just cut off the relationship and move on or some that would be failure so they get munchausen syndrome by proxy i will poison you and make you sick so that you get rushed to the hospital and then i'll come rushing in to rescue you and people do that and you can watch netflix stuff about that that is a real thing that happens some parents do it with children so that the child still needs the parent as much as they did when they were really little all a desperate attempt to still be the hero in that person's life so those are some of the things that we need to do to save the world from this virus and i want to thank you for being here and thank you for joining us today we are now going to talk about the first part of the program the first part of the program is about the first part of the program we are going to talk about the first part of the program is about the first part of the program which is the second part of the program is about the first part of the program which is the second part of the program things that begin to happen out of shame i'm going to save the last two till next time um but i hope that just gives you a little bit of insight into this shame is not just some innocent little thing that's not a big deal shame at the core of your being affects everything in your life negatively that's what i want you to understand and once you understand that you begin to realize it affects me but it affects my relationships and it sets up my relationships to fail and so i need to deal with this shame if i'm going to be healthy if i'm going to have a healthy relationship with my kids with my partner with my friends that's how big a deal it is so how does it affect a person's relationship with god i don't know if you ever thought of that but i would think from my experience and what i do that for most shame-based people it deeply affects their relationship with god so number one would be why would god love me i'm unlovable so i don't really believe though i believe it academically that he loves me i don't let myself feel that he loves me that's part one part two sadly for many churches that don't understand shame and the effect of shame they provide ways for people to wear masks and hopefully get love and respect from god so you can hide the real you just come and serve and keep these rules and do these things then god will love you they don't feel that god loved them if they didn't do those things but only if they do those things and so the question that i have thought about for years and i think needs a clear answer to shame-based people is it's important to get to the point where you see that god loves you as you are you do not have to perform or do anything so what i wanted to do in the christian part in this shame series is give you bible stories that illustrate that okay so tonight i'm going to tell you a story from the life of king david and we've told you a story about the life of king david and we've told you a story about a number of stories from him his life but it's going to be about a guy named mephibosheth now i don't know who would call their kid that but that was his name i even thought of how could i abbreviate that do i call him fib no that doesn't work meth no that's too much like meth bosh no that doesn't work so we got mephibosheth okay so just to give you the context david's been king for 20 years and so he's well established as king during that 20 years of his reign the nation of israel has grown eight or conquered eight nations and grown six times its normal size so it's expanded and it has just prospered and so he has become basically the richest king in the world and he's got all this territory etc so it's a time of great popularity a time of great wealth and prestige david is at the top of his game at the pinnacle of his life so the question that people have would go like this when david became a king the thing that they were told about david was he was a man with god's heart a man after god's own heart has wealth changed him has power changed him has popularity changed him is through his silliness just because these people have poor connections to god and their family matters is 1989 Steve said what if you say she did test before him and what do you expect this guy to do to.

come on out so you're having one in a communist so jim that's the kind of moment when you go oh no i'll we wanted to start can we turn this around for some reason before you lady shake hands like and come win in the notice at least do this so we've got david and his 19 year old brother Steve what's the greatest 맞아 David call game that the years class but it's me drop that Bereich a dollar start is like Kenny Fralick had a million dollars if there was anything like that if he needed to know what was important on bookoghlandesainslinks in Minnesota connectivity in Massachusetts is whatession was Jonathan and David and Jonathan were close close friends like brothers were told and David made a promise to Jonathan that he would take care of his descendants if Jonathan died so now after twenty years a being a king he remembers that promise and he says is there still anyone alive in sauce family because I promised Jonathan I'd show them kindness and so somebody comes and says Jonathan son Mephibosheth is still alive now you have to understand why that was the dumbest question that people thought David should have asked because in that culture the Kings passed to their sons and their grandson so that you had a dynasty so who would have been the greatest threat the King David's power as the King of Israel a little guy named Mephibosheth he was the only one left from King Saul's family so he was the greatest threat to David's power and David's kingdom so for David to say is there still anybody alive that I can be good to people are going David no because the common practice when a king took over a throne is he killed all the descendants of the previous came to make sure there were no threats to his kingdom and David is doing the exact opposite he's wanting to find members of the previous king's family in order to help them so when our told about this Mephibosheth guy so Saul's son Jonathan had his son Mephibosheth who is a cripple since he was a child when he was five years old the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had died in a battle.

So that's how Saul's reign ended and David became king.

20 years earlier, Saul had been in a war, Jonathan with him.

They died in battle.

When the news came out that Saul and Jonathan were dead, the nurse of that little boy, Mephibosheth, said, the new king's going to want to kill him.

I better hide him.

So she scooped him up and as she was picked him up and fled and as she hurried away, she dropped him and he became a cripple.

He broke his legs.

So here is a boy who can't walk and he hasn't been able to walk since he's been very, or since five years old.

So he's 25 now, 20 years of not walking.

The next thing we're told about him is that when the nurse scooped him up, she took him to a place called Lodabar.

And that is a town that was named No Pasture Land.

So what she is doing is saying, what is the location in Israel that nobody would ever want to go to?

Where there would be no chance of having a job, a farm, an income, because there's, it's a desert, there's no pasture, it's a desert.

And she's going to be a slave.

And she's going to be a slave.

And she's going to be a slave.

And she's going to be a slave.

And she's going to be a slave.

And she's going to be a slave.

It is the last place anybody would look.

So it's the best place to hide because it's the remote, most remote place in all of Israel, Lodabar.

That's where you're going, Mephibosheth.

So he's been hiding in this far away, out in the desert, little village for 20 years.

Okay?

So nothing has happened.

But what I want you to understand is that I think when it says Lodabar, No Pasture Land, it's also using it as a place to hide.

It's also using it as a place to hide.

It's also using it as a metaphor.

It is saying that as Mephibosheth, the favored son of Jonathan, who is destined to be the king of Israel, had to run and flee for his life and became a cripple, he's been a No Pasture Land soul.

He's been dead inside.

There's been nothing of life that's growing there.

His life has been dark and empty and barren.

Now I want you to think of that in terms of yourself.

Many of you can relate to being Mephibosheth as a five-year-old.

You had a good life.

You had parents who were wealthy.

You had a nice home.

You had every privilege that a kid could get.

You had it all going for you.

You had a bright future ahead of you, just like Mephibosheth had.

And he would have been chosen as the child in the nation of Israel who would have been chosen as the child of Israel.

And he would have been chosen as the child of Israel.

And he would have been chosen as the child of Israel.

And he would have been the best at succeeding.

He would have had the brightest future of anybody else living in Israel.

That was his destiny as a five-year-old kid.

Twenty years later, no family, no money, no friends, a cripple, dead, isolated, lost everything, no future.

It all looks scary.

His life is lived in hiding and fear.

Sound like an addict?

Who's lost everything.

He's been a Mephibosheth.

He's been a Mephibosheth.

He's been a Mephibosheth.

He's been a Mephibosheth.

He's been a Mephibosheth.

He's been a son of God.

He's been a son of God.

He's been a son of God.

He's been a son of God.

He's been a son of God.

You know what?

How Mephibosheth referred to himself when David finally brought him into the castle?

He says, refer to me as a dead dog.

And what that meant was, I'm useless.

I'm full of shame.

I feel I have zero value.

I feel my life is like a dead dog.

And that is what many of you relate to.

So here is what David says.

David's story is saying.

How does God feel about the Mephibosheths of the world?

How does God feel about the people who've lost everything and live in fear and brokenness and emptiness with no future prospects?

Does God love them or say they deserve it?

I'm going to wipe them out.

And what this story is saying, David has God's heart.

So how David responds is how God feels about the Mephibosheths of the world.

So watch what happens.

David sent for him and brought him to the palace.

Now you can imagine when a messenger shows up out in Lodabar and you've been hiding successfully for 20 years and says, Oh, we finally found you.

King David wants to see you.

You're going, I hope my will's in good shape here because I'm about to be killed.

You're filled with dread.

And when he came to David, he bowed low to the ground in deep respect.

Don't be afraid, David said.

I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan.

I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather, Saul.

That's a lot of property.

And you will eat here with me at the king's table.

In other words, Mephibosheth, I'm giving you back what you once had.

You never have to worry about being cared for again.

You never have to worry about a meal again.

I will meet your needs now.

You are going to finally get taken care of the way you should have all along.

Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, Who is your servant that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?

Do you want to know what God's love, feels like?

I don't deserve it.

And that's what Mephibosheth is feeling.

Why are you doing this?

It doesn't logically make sense.

I don't deserve this kind of love.

You should be wanting to kill me, not love me.

And so from that time on, Mephibosheth ate regularly at David's table like one of the king's own son.

He didn't get the corner table while the king's sons had the nice table.

And he got the scraps.

No, he sat with everybody else.

He got the royal treatment.

So here's the word I want you to understand, to understand God's heart.

When Moses went up into a mountain, wait, before this time and received the Ten Commandments, he said to God, Please show me what you're like.

Show me your glory.

And God said, I'm going to hide you in a rock and I'm going to pass in front of you and let you see my glory, my greatness.

And then he went on to say, Let me describe to you myself.

And what he said is, Here is the core of my character.

Here's the essence that all of my character is built on.

And guess what it is?

It's not anger like some people would try to make you think God's core is.

It's a word that's called chesed.

And chesed is a word that our English language can't fully capture.

It's a word that includes, I am committed to you unconditionally forever.

Like a parent would say to a child.

It is a word that includes love, delight, forgiveness, grace, mercy.

So what's mercy?

I don't get what I deserve.

What's grace?

I get what I don't deserve.

Instead of getting the judgment I deserve, I get the blessings I don't deserve.

So what God is saying is, You want to get to the core to me?

To the core of me?

I don't set up relationships based on you earn my love.

All my relationships are grace and mercy.

Chesed.

I overflow in giving people what they do not deserve.

A kindness and forgiveness.

It talked about a depth of love only known by a parent or a couple that loves each other in a deep healthy way.

And that's what it is saying is, God's love.

So how does God feel about the Mephibosheth of the world?

Is he saying, You got to earn my love?

Is he saying, You better hide your shame and start keeping these rules?

He says, I see your shame.

I see what you deserve.

I see all of that about you.

But I want you to know something.

You're living in Lodabar.

You're empty.

All of those things.

I'm going to find you and I'm going to love you.

And I want to bless you.

And I want to fill up your life again.

And I want to give you gifts that you can use.

I want to give you gifts that you could never earn.

And I'm giving them to you all because of grace.

And that is the message that comes from God.
