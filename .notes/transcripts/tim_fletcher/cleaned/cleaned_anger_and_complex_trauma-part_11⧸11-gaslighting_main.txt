I want to do one final thing on this series on anger.  And I want to focus on what I would consider to be probably the worst type of abuse possible.  And it's called gaslighting.  And you may have heard of it.  You may wonder what in the world is gaslighting all about.  It is based on a 1944 movie that was adapted from a 1938 play called Gaslight.  So Angela Lansbury plays in it.  Kim and I watched it.  And basically it's about a husband that begins to do things to slowly make his wife think she's going crazy.  And so that has become the term gaslighting.  Okay.  So how I am going to use it tonight is in light of that.

But let me just give you a couple things to help you understand gaslighting.  Gaslighting, like I said, is what I would consider the most severe type of abuse.  It's not physical abuse.  It goes beyond verbal abuse, emotional abuse.  It's really a psychological warfare where it wears a person down, their self-worth down, so that they begin.  They begin to doubt everything about themselves.  They doubt their thinking.  They doubt their perception of reality.  And they begin to trust their partner to tell them what reality is, to tell them about their own value, so they give more and more power to their partner to control them.  And their partner's goal is to bring them to a place like a whipped animal where they have no control over their own life.  They have no will of their own.  And they are just this scared creature who responds to this cruel master.  It is carried out by people who would be in a narcissist classification.  So they are all about themselves.  They just get pleasure out of using and abusing people.  And when they are with somebody for any length of time, they quickly lose control.  They lose respect for that person.  And then they begin to try and tear that person down, to slowly dismantle their self-worth, their self-trust, until they are really in their own eyes at nothing.  And then the narcissist has total power, total control, but there is a destroyed life in the process.  So I am going to go through gaslighting in a way that I hope will help you understand it.  If you have experienced it, you will quickly understand what I am talking about.  If you are in a situation where you currently are being gaslighted, I hope it will give you permission as well as a wake-up call to act and get out of that.  Because the longer you stay in a gaslighting situation, the more you are worn down, which makes it the harder to leave.  And so it's a very dangerous situation.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  And I hope you understand that.  It's a very dangerous thing to be part of if you are on the recipient end of somebody that is gaslighting you.  So I want to start with four types of things that a gaslighter will do to begin to wear you down.  So again, it's to get you to begin to think maybe you are going crazy and that you cannot trust your own self anymore, your own perception of reality.  So number one is they can begin to play games with you to make you question your memory so you might go home every night and put your keys in the same spot and then one night they will remove the keys when you are not looking and hide them somewhere else and you will go looking for your keys and you cannot find it and they will not admit that they have moved them they will let you begin to wonder if you are losing your memory so that is a very initial type of thing that they do to plant the idea that your memory maybe is not as reliable so that can go in various directions the second thing is what we would call withholding and that simply is you try to discuss something with them and you do not succeed in discussing it so you try to discuss something with them and they act like they do not understand you like you are not making sense and and they are basically saying you are talking crazy I do not get what you are trying to say and the idea is to plant the idea in your mind that maybe you do not make sense maybe you are going crazy so again it's a planting of a thought or you start to talk about something and you make perfect sense but they are not going to admit that they are going to say you are you are talking crazy and then they are going to say I refuse to talk about this until you can talk sense we are done and they shut it down and you walk away with no way to clarify no way to have them try to understand you you are just shut down left with the feeling or the impression from them that you are talking crazy and you begin to doubt yourself or you are trying to discuss something with them and they keep changing the topic and do not let you discuss it and develop it or they just say you know what you have tried to talk about this over and over again it's constant craziness I am done no more talking about this subject and they shut it permanently down so those are all ways of stopping fruitful conversation because they do not allow you to do it but they make you feel that you are crazy or you are not clear the third thing that they do is theyüyorsun these are the things that they would not allow you to use in a normal life well this is the thing think about this a lot of you tell people think that and they say well that's I am doing this because this led you but that's not you know what's the matter with trying to discover something through multiple means that are not violative or that with one or the other is it happened in one of the different fields itwn notes to beosexual گكون itwn Jesus being sexual or he is manual justice Because if you turn on a document, they are meaning深 So again, you start to question yourself.  Maybe I am too sensitive.  Maybe I do overreact.  Maybe I make too big of a deal out of things.  And you question your perception.  So right up front, what I hope you are beginning to see is what is happening here does not wear you down in one day or one week or one month, but they slowly plant seeds that gradually get you to doubt yourself.  And that is the effect of gaslighting.  It's such a slow process that you often do not even realize it's happening.  The fourth thing they can do is forgetting.  So you talk about something and they say, no, I was there.  That did not happen.  Where it did happen, but they make it sound like it did not happen, so they are questioning your memory and again, you are questioning your own memory.  So they can go a bit further and go, you know what?  You always are remembering things incorrectly.  What's wrong with you?  You make stuff up.  You are imagining things.

Now, they are the one that is lying to you about all of that, but you are believing it as if they are true.  Or you start talking about something and they act like they forgot all about what you said before.  And so they deny that they were in the conversation with you and they again say, you know what?  I think you are making stuff up.  I do not think you are remembering this correctly because I sure do not remember it.  Again, planting seeds of doubt.  So it's a very gradual process.  So the 16 signs that you can then ask yourself that are indicators that you are being gaslit, okay?  So you can check these off.  Number one is that you are in a conversation with your partner and every time there's conflict or a disagreement, you feel pulled by them to blame yourself for the problems that you are having in the relationship.  In other words, they always make it your fault.  They never accept responsibility, but twist everything and make it your fault.  So whatever you say, they distort it and they make it your fault.  So you begin to think maybe they are right because I always seem to be messing up.  And they can give very convincing arguments why you are wrong and they are right and it's all your fault.  So you get that constantly pulled into accepting blame for everything.  Secondly, you begin to second guess yourself.  So you are in situations.  You are in situations where you are in a situation where you are in a situation where you are in a situation and you all of a sudden go, maybe I am not seeing this accurately.  Now let me just stop here and say this.  Part of complex trauma is that you are going to have times where you legitimately question your perception because you know it's distorted because you are angry or you are in fear.  So that's healthy questioning your perception.  What's happening in gaslighting is even when you are not in an emotionally escalated state, you start to question.  You start to question your perception.  The times that you normally in the past would have been accurate in your perception, you now question and doubt yourself.  So you are having less confidence in yourself.  Thirdly, you begin to conclude that maybe they are right and I am too sensitive.  Maybe they are right and I make too big a deal out of things.  I just need to get over stuff.  I let too much stuff.  I let too much stuff bother me.  Again, complex trauma, often we do overreact.  Gaslighting, they make you question everything as an overreaction.  And so it takes it one step further than just the natural consequences that come out of complex trauma.  Three, or four, you constantly apologize.  So you are with a friend and you are not going to apologize.  You are going to apologize.  You are going to apologize.  And you say something and then you go, oh, I am sorry.  I hope I did not say the wrong thing.  Or sorry, I might have hurt your feelings.  And after a while they go, would you quit apologizing?  Because you have been trained that you are always wrong.  That there's nothing you do that is ever all right.  There's always something wrong.  So you say something wrong.  You do something wrong.  So you are trained to apologize all the time.  Next one is you feel with that that you cannot do anything wrong.  You cannot do anything right.  So this is when those subtle seeds and messages that have been happening for months from your partner are starting to take their toll.  And now you are beginning to believe that maybe you cannot do anything well.  And maybe you cannot do anything right.  So you are starting now to look down on yourself even more than normal.  You are starting to be harder on yourself than even normal.  Next one is you feel very confused at times about what is the right decision.  So should I get 1% milk or 2% milk?  And you stand there second guessing yourself.  And you are confused.  And you are afraid of making the wrong decision because you are going to get in trouble.  And so the most basic decisions become more difficult to make because you are doubting your ability to make any decisions.  Then you start lying to your partner to avoid his put downs.  So if he said, what did you go to the store for?  And you say, well I went to get milk.  All of a sudden you are afraid that he's going to criticize that.  So you lie about where you went.  So that is now taking lying to a new level in the relationship because you are constantly in fear of being judged by them.  And that is a very dangerous place.  So you are constantly trying to avoid all of these criticisms that he's going to give you.  Then though, when you are with your friends, they probably saw a long time ago that he was a narcissist and that he was not treating you well.  And they might even have seen some of the gas lighting.

But you do not want to admit to them that they are right.  So you lie to your friends about your partner because you are afraid to admit what you are in.  And so you do not want them to even gang up more and say, get out of this.  So you are lying and making excuses for your partner's behavior.  And that enables your partner to continue gas lighting.  Because you are now making excuses for him.

But because people are concerned and people are asking family and friends, you do not want to keep lying all the time.  You do not want them to keep questioning you.  So you start to withdraw from your supports.  You start to pull away from the very people that you should not be pulling away from.  So your world gets smaller until basically the narcissist is the only person in your world.  And that is what he wants.  Because now, as you pull away from friends and family, they lose their power to influence you against him.  And he gains even more power over you.  And then you begin to really feel that you are not happy.  And you go, why am I so depressed?  Why am I so full of anxiety?  Why am I so discontent and unhappy and unhappy?  And you are questioning your own inner world.  Because you begin to realize that you are living in a negative emotional place.  And that, up till now, has probably been somewhat in the subconscious.  You have been unaware of what has been happening emotionally.

But now there's so much negative emotions, it's starting to come into your conscious world.  You begin to become aware also with that, that your self-esteem is getting lower.  And you think, I used to be so confident around my friends and family.  Now I am constantly full of anxiety and insecurity around people, afraid I am going to say the wrong thing, I am going to do the wrong thing.  And now you are realizing your self-confidence is getting worse, is getting lower, and you are not as relaxed as you used to be.  You are not as happy.  And so you realize that you are going to a darker and darker place.  And it's not a good place.  You see that you are not the person you used to be, but you are becoming a shell of that person, and that person is not a very happy person, is not a very healthy person.  And so again, you are becoming aware of it.  That takes you further in isolating.  Because the less confidence you have, the less relaxed you are, the less you want to be around people, because you think everybody else is thinking the same thing as your partner about you.  You think they are judging you and looking down on you, and seeing you as a failure, and that causes you to isolate, which causes your self-esteem to get even worse.  And then, you do not think anybody else would want a relationship with you, and you do not think anybody would ever give you unconditional love, because you are such a loser, and that takes you even further into isolation.  So what you can see is there's a snowballing effect beginning to happen as you go further and further down this road of being gaslit.  So now, you realize something's wrong.

But because you have been so influenced by your partner in your thinking, and you have let your partner think for you, you cannot figure out what's wrong.  You cannot say it's him, because he's never said that.  In your mind, it's all you, but you do not know what it is you have done.  And so you enter this very confused stage of trying to diagnose why you are in such a dark place, with no self-confidence, no self-worth, and you are just full of anxiety, and you cannot figure it out.  Then, conflict just keeps increasing.  And he is more, or she is more, on you all the time, more negative, more disrespectful, tearing you down, but nothing is ever resolved in the conflicts.  Rather, you are always the problem, and they always play the victim.  I cannot stand living with you.  You do not do anything right.  Poor me.  Who would ever want to live with a person with me?  Give me a crown for being such a wonderful person and putting up with you.  And that just is what gets fed.  His victim mentality, your, it's all my fault.  And that takes it even worse.  So the conflict is snowballing, and increasing.  Some people, as this progresses, their memory actually does become hazy.  And what I would say is the explanation for that is what you can realize is gaslighting began in your subconscious world.  Once the stress on your subconscious world got so great, it moved to your conscious world.

But you were not able to figure it out or resolve it.  So what then happened?  So what then happens is the stress keeps building and building in your conscious world with no solution.  That begins to affect your memory.  So when stress is too great for the brain, it cannot keep track of everything.  So your short-term memory begins to fail.  And so now you do forget details, which gives proof to the gaslighter that you are going crazy.  So now you are actually feeding into what he's been doing all along to say you are losing your mind, you are the problem.  So again, this is getting to a very dangerous place.  And the final piece is you start to gaslight yourself.  You do not need anybody else to gaslight you now.  You start to question every perception, doubt every thought, doubt every feeling, and put it all in a negative framework.  Now you are your own worst enemy.  So those are the 16 characteristics of a person who's been gaslit.  Some of you have gone through that.  Some of you are in the process.  You have not got to the bottom ones yet, but you can see that it's starting to snowball.  So let me take you to the next thing.  So gaslighting involves what we call the gaslight tango, or it's a dance between you and your partner.

But it's a dance where you give them the control to take the lead in the dance.  So they take the next step and you follow in this gaslight tango.  And what you are doing in giving them the lead is you are letting them define your reality for you.  So they are defining it.  If you have not heard it yet in what I said, let me recap it.  They define your reality in three areas.  Number one, they define yourself, who you are.  And so what is happening is a healthy, positive self image is gradually eroded so that it becomes less and less, more and more negative until you feel like a zero.  And that is their goal, to get all positive self esteem knocked out of you.  Because it's only then that they can have total power over you.  So that's number one.  They need to define your identity for you and not let you define your own identity.  Secondly, they need to define your perception of reality.  And they want to get you to the place where you think that you cannot even determine what's real anymore.  Because you get it all mixed up.  They told you, you misread this, you misread that.  You are making that up.  So in your mind, you are not sure what is fantasy or reality or a lie.  And you let them tell you what it is.  And they do that for you.  And then they get so you never question them.  So in the early days of gaslighting, the response when they say you are making that up is what's wrong with you?  Like I was there, I know what happened.  And they go, no you do not.  You are making that up.  At first you go, they are having a bad day.  And you can identify something's off with them.

But over time, they can be negative and distorted all the time.  And you can no longer tell that they are distorted.  You can no longer tell something is off.  So they get you to the place where you never question whether the problem is them.  Where you never question whether they are the ones that are twisting reality and you are the one that is seeing it accurately.  So they have worn down the three things you need to move forward in life.  And they have become the ones that are making you feel that way and they are going to make you feel that way in a healthy way.  And that is the tragedy of gaslighting.  Now let me recap the process that happens.  So it's a very gradual process that happens typically in stages.  Okay?  Now all the stages do not necessarily follow in a linear order.  They can overlap.  They can cross and they can stand that up front.

But secondly, what they define is different stages of where you are at emotionally and psychologically.  So it will start in one place and as you have all of the gaslighting, it moves you to a very different psychological and emotional place.  So number one is disbelief.  In the beginning, when your partner says that did not happen, you do not believe them.  You go, that's crazy.  And you can say something's wrong with them.  Okay?

But you start to believe them.  Okay?

But it starts with disbelief and then that vanishes.  Okay?  So if you are seeing things that cause you to go, this is crazy.  That did happen.  They are saying it did not, but it did.  Take that as a red flag.  Okay?  Second thing is you defend yourself.  You fight back.  You say that did not happen.  I know what I saw.  I know what I am thinking accurately.  And you have a big argument about it.  So you start with shock and disbelief that they are saying that you are wrong.  Then you argue about it.

But then you go beyond that.  Okay?  So if you do not stop with number one and you go and you keep arguing and keep arguing, but you stay in the relationship and you do not get out even though they never admit they are wrong, then you go to the third stage and that is their goal.  And that is the stage that has a lot of depression as part of it.  So you do not even know who you are.  You do not like what you are feeling.  Who you are almost seems like you are an alien creature from who you used to be.  And that's really depressing.  And so now you walk around hating yourself, down on yourself, not liking being in your own skin even more than normal.  And then that depression comes further by being cut off from all your supports.  So the people who would normally encourage you, the people that would normally validate your perception of things and your feelings, are not around.  And that adds to the depression because there's nobody helping you in this journey.  And then you go, you have people express concern about how you are doing, but they treat you like you got a problem.  And that confirms that you do have a problem.  So anybody that comes up and say, are you okay?  You do not go, oh, thank you for caring.  You go, I think you think I am crazy.  And now you go, see, everybody thinks I am crazy, not just my partner.  So now you are misinterpreting kindness, concern, because you have come to such a distorted place in your thinking.  So it does not matter what anybody does, you interpret it through a negative lens.  So that is gaslighting.  Now the question I want to end with is, why do you think I am crazy?  Why is it that people from complex trauma are the ones, I would say, almost 100% of the time that fall prey to being gaslit?  And it's very important to understand that a person coming out of a healthy home who's got a fairly healthy way of looking at life and dealing with life, if they met a gaslighter and developed a friendship with them, it would be ended.  As soon as they saw the warning signs.  What causes a person to go and stay in that and let it take its toll?  They come from complex trauma.  So how does complex trauma set a person up to be gaslit by somebody else?  Number one, shame.  Complex trauma naturally teaches a child the reason I am abused, neglected, or abandoned is I must not be good enough.  And so to compensate for that, because they do not feel lovable or valuable, they say I need to become a people pleaser.  And that means I just agree with everybody, I go along with everybody, but I need people to like me.  Narcissists prey on those kind of people.  And they begin by giving you positive validation.  And you soak it in.  And you want it.

But then they start withholding validation.  And you think, I just need to try harder.  And then they start disrespecting you.  And then gaslighting you.

But you are so desperate to get validation, you stay in there and keep trying to improve.  Because when they say, if you would only change here and do this, I would not be so angry at you.  And you believe that.  So you say, okay, I will just try to change here.  And you change, but they do not validate you.  They just go to another area and say, you are a loser here.  And then you try there.  Because you are desperate to prove that you are lovable.  Secondly, complex trauma you never felt understood.  Parents did not take the time often to see the world through your eyes.  To understand you.  To get you.  To get your dreams, your passions, your fears.  And so you always tried to get people to understand you.  Many people in complex trauma were made to feel they were stupid.  People rolled their eyes when they talked.  And so they have this huge thing, I need to make people understand me.  Because once they understand me, they believe, then they will validate me.  And what do you get with a gaslighter?  Somebody who does not understand you.  And you go, I just need to explain myself.  I just need to explain myself.  And they are going, fantastic, here's all kinds of ammunition for me to twist and use against them.

But you keep trying to make them understand.  Thirdly, complex trauma, tons of insecurities.  About your body, about your personality, about your emotional makeup.  And so there's a lot of self-doubt that comes with, am I perfect?  Am I pretty enough?  Am I smart enough?  Am I too boring?  Am I too shy?  I wish I was more outgoing.  All of that makes a person vulnerable to a gaslighter.  Because they are trying to prove to themselves that they are good enough.  Because of their self-doubt.  Fourthly, what happens in complex trauma is you get an authority figure, a parent or a school teacher, who says they love you, but then communicates to you that you are selfish or you are a burden.  So you say to mom or dad, can I sign up to play hockey?  And they go, you are such a selfish kid.  And so what do you do as a child?  You say they are right.  Because mom and dad, in your mind, are always right when you are really little.  So then you take your brain and you go, I will twist my brain.
