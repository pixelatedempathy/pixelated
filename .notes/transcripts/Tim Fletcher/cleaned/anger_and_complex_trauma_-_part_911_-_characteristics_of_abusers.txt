Same thing.  I hope it does not get as focused this week, but I have felt the need to include in this anger series this topic of abuse because so many of you have experienced it, and my concern is a lot who have experienced it have not yet processed it, so they have grown from it.  They are still kind of stuck, afraid to go back and look at this very painful part of their life.  So I want to begin tonight by just asking a very simple question.  Why is it that some people become abusive?  And it's an important question to ask, and there's two very critical pieces in answering that.  So number one is that everybody who's an abuser has a lot of shame.  That is almost a given in my mind.  So what happens with shame, which comes out of complex trauma, is when mom or dad abuse me or neglect me or abandon me, the child concludes it's my fault.  It's because I am not good enough.  I must be a bad person.  So your whole sense of identity is shaped to be a negative.  What happens with people with that is nobody likes to live just walking around hating themselves and feeling that.  And so people compensate or respond to shame in a variety of different ways.  After this anger series, we are going to do a whole series on shame to really develop that and explore that.  And just to give you a heads up, it will be heavy, but I hope a very healing series for you.

But what happens with that is that people compensate by going to I am better than everybody.  And then what happens with that is they go, my needs are more important than everybody else's as well.  So you get the formation of a narcissist.  And then there's a fear that they do not want to acknowledge that they deny.  And that is deep down, they still believe that you would not want to stay with me if I gave you a choice.  That you would probably find somebody better than me.  So the only way you are going to stay with me is if I control you.  So you can see right in there, you have an abuse element developing.  Because if you rebel against my control, then I am going to have to use abuse to try to regain control.  And the other piece with shame is shame, though people might not be aware of it or acknowledge it.  Shame has a lot of impact on you.  And that's why I am going to talk about shame.  Shame has a huge anger component.  You are angry at yourself, you are angry at the world, you are angry at life, and you lash out at people who are the closest to you.  So that becomes the formation of an abuser.  A lot of shame.

But you have to look at the flip side.  And that is why do certain people stay with abusers or get attracted to abusers?  And the answer is, they have the same shame.  And deep down, they respond in a different way.  And they go, nobody would ever love me a lot for who I am.  So I have to become content with getting a few crumbs of love once in a while.  That's probably the best that I can do.  So if I am in a relationship where I am abused, but I get love once in a while, I will just have to put up with that and accept that because that's the best I am going to get.  So you get the two sides of shame that get attracted to each other and end up in a relationship.  And both are necessary to keep the relationship going.  Do you realize if the person who takes the abuse and says, I am content with a few crumbs, they could have left many, many times, but they stay there.  And the question is why?  And it's the shame thing.  Only the flip side of it.  The flip side of the response to shame.

The next thing goes like this.  I work with addicts every day.  And the question I often want them to consider is, if you look inside of yourself, you are a whole bunch of desires and hormones and chemicals and needs.  And those needs and desires and drives are all in competition with each other.  So you got a desire for something.  You got a desire for food, for sex, for relationships, for position, for power, all in competition.  Okay?  In a healthy person, there's one drive, one need that trumps everything else, and that is love.  So I will have a sex drive, but never to the point where it violates love.  Love will trump that.  What happens in an abuser is things begin to change.  They trump love.  And as soon as something begins to trump love, you can become an abuser.  And so we all have the potential to be abusive because we all struggle every day with competing desires.  And sometimes they do trump love.  We get selfish.  An abuser is the things that consistently trump love are there all the time.  And so that becomes the main part of love.  And so that becomes the main part of their life.  Love still pokes out once in a while, but other forces are the more powerful forces in their life.  So let me give you a couple examples.  So if a person has this sex drive, it can become a lust thing.  If it trumps love, guess what you have?  I want my sex drive gratified.  I do not care if I hurt you.  So now you get sexual abuse and rape.  That is where the sex drive has trumped love.  And so then sex then becomes abusive.  It becomes using of other people.  Second one, greed.  We all have this desire.  I want money.  I want position.  And so what happens if your desire for money trumps love?  I will steal from you.

But if it's healthy, I will love will always win over you.  I will love you.  I will love you.

But if it's not healthy, I will have a desire for money.  And I will never violate you.  I will never use you or steal from you.  Same as lust for power.  Think of image.  If you grew up in a home where image was more important than anything else, when you went out in public, you knew that mom and dad were not really loving you.  That was all fake.

But you had to keep an image.  And if you did not maintain the image while you were in public, the image while you were out there in public, you got it when you got home.  Because what your parents were saying is, my image is more important than loving you.  So if you do not maintain my image, I will hurt you.  So it overpowered love.  The same is true with resentments.  If we let them take over, they will begin to overpower love.  So I can have a hurt, be hurt by somebody else, and be angry, but if I am healthy, I will not ever use my anger in a way to hurt you.  Love will win.  I will be respectful.  I will work my anger out in a loving way.

But if I give in to resentment, I want to hurt you.  I do not care about love anymore.  Then shame.  If you think of being with an abusive person who's got lots of shame, what happens is if you ever, if you ever, expose in public their weakness, or make them look bad, you are going to pay for it.  Hiding shame is their highest priority.  And so you can take comfort, ease, control.  If those are your priority that overpowers love, you will end up being abusive.  So if you get all kinds of those things, then you become even more likely to become abusive.

So, if anything trumps love, and that thing becomes threatened, I become abusive.  So that's the underlying forces.  So part of why I want you to think about this in these terms, is some people's response to people who are abusive is, just stop doing it.  As if that's supposed to make them just stop doing it.  The reality is, they cannot stop doing it till they deal with their shame, and they deal with their shame, until they get those other things that have trumped love, to be under love.  And that does not happen overnight.  So dealing with abuse, is not just quitting, it is dealing with deep, deep issues that go back a long way.  And so for most people, dealing with those issues is a gradual, slow process, but it is absolutely essential.

The next thing, that I want you to realize, is the more things that you have in your life, that trump love, the more of a narcissist you are.  Because what narcissism says, is my needs, my priorities, trump you every time.  And so that is again, the subject of these competing priorities, and whether we reign them in, or give them power, because as soon as we give them power, over love, we become a narcissist who abuses.  So those are two key underlying things, as to why a person becomes an abuser.  Second thing, what characterizes an abuser?

So, how can I spot one?

Now, let me just say this up front.  I can go through this list, and I believe there's 19 things in this list, and you can know this all in your head, and you can go and fall in love with a jerk, and ignore everything I say.  You can go, yes, he's got all 19, but I am still going home with him.  So just knowing this list, does not stop you from choosing an abuser.  You have to deal with your shame stuff, before you have the strength to resist this list.

So, first thing, is abusers do not come and show their true colors on day one.  They come wearing a very well crafted, well crafted mask.  And they are great at being a salesman, and fooling you, and selling you on a fantasy, phony product, and making you think it's real.  And so part of the journey in spotting an abuser, is not getting sucked in by the salesman, waiting long enough until that mask slips a little bit, and you see the true colors, and then you go, no, not going any further in this relationship.  So they start charming, and so they can build up your self-esteem.  They sense you have shame, and what do they do in their salesman role?  They tell you how wonderful you are.  They tell you how much they adore you.  They want to spend every minute with you.  Now understand this, that's only for the first few months.  Then after that, that begins to change.  The second thing is, they will try to rush you in the relationship.  You are saying, I got to go slowly here to see their true colors.  They go, I cannot let them go slowly, because my salesman act only lasts so long.  So I got to rush it here, and put pressure on them, and usually the thing that they lean on, to try to get you to speed stuff up, is sex.  If I can get them in bed, and we have great sex, then I can get them to speed things up.  So what they are actually doing, is grooming you, and what we mean by that, is they are breaking down your natural caution, and your natural hesitance to trust somebody new.  They are breaking that down, to get you to trust too early.  And so that's what we call grooming.  Once they start to get you, and you are starting to get, you are starting to show interest in them, they will then begin to try to isolate you, from your other supports.  So they want to be the only person in your life, that carries influence with you.  And if they see your parents still carry a lot of influence, and friends carry a lot of influence, they will begin to try to isolate you from them.  Now they will not come up right away and say, your parents are jerks, your friends are jerks, I want to dominate.  They go, why do you need them?  You have got me, we are great together.  We help each other.  We do not need those other things.  And you like hearing that, and you get sucked into that.  So that has a bigger thing of control.  You will see them more and more, wanting to control everything in your life.  Your activities, your time, who you see, when you see them.  Control begins to take over.  They want to check your phone, check your Facebook.  All of that control just keeps going up and up.  Then you will see jealousy going up and up.  So at first they will not reveal jealousy, but jealousy becomes the beginning of the mask starting to slip.  Because that will show how angry they can become, how controlling they can become, and that begins to happen.  Then disrespect comes.  Disrespect will start to happen.  So at first in the salesman role, they sound like they respect you more than anything else in the world.

But once the jealousy and control starts to build, they start taking shots at you.  Put downs.  Things that make you feel stupid.  Things that make you feel like a burden.  That you are lucky that they are so patient with you.  And then that can begin to go into public, public things that they say around other people where they put you down in front of your friends or your family.  So that begins to happen.  Manipulation, emotional abuse.  So they turn often into little wee boys and girls who pout, have temper tantrums, give you the silent treatment, withhold affection from you.  All part of a manipulation game.  Next characteristic.  They do not respect your boundaries.  They want you to respect their boundaries, but they think they can do whatever they want as far as your time, your phone, showing up, taking all your time.  Your no does not mean no to them.  Lack of respect for boundaries.  They will get more and more critical.  So again, let me say, you are not going to see this till you endure or get past the salesman stage.  Once you get past that, these things start coming up.  Now the problem with the critical, it will get to a point where it does not matter what you do, it will never be good enough.  So that then means they will criticize everything.  Everything, nothing will please them.  They will become a victim.  So not just a little boy or girl, but now they blame everybody for their problems.  They blame others for their decisions.  They do not own any of their own choices.  So if they lose their job or they lose their temper, it's your fault, it's somebody else's fault, it's never their fault.  Double standard.  I can go through your phone, you cannot go through mine.  I can get angry, you cannot.  I can cut you off from your friends, you cannot cut me off from my friends.  So you will see, double standard more and more.  Then you will start to see inconsistencies, mood swings.  Happy, angry, in a heartbeat.  We are having a great day together till you are being punched in the face in a heartbeat.  So that begins to happen.  So in the salesman mode, you got a consistent sales job.  The mask never fell off.  Now you are starting to see it slip regularly.  And their true self comes out.  Now the danger for people is this.  They think the sales job was the true them and the slipping of the mask that's coming out, they think that's the exception.  Oh, they are just having a bad day.  And you make excuses for them.  The reality is the sales job was the mask.  Now it's slipping and you are seeing the real.

But that is hard to believe when you have had a month or two of a great sales job.  Then you find them emotionally unavailable.  You try to connect.  You try to work things out.  And they are just not doing it.  And so you feel more and more detached, more unable to connect all the time.  Next, they use love as a tool and a weapon.  So in the beginning in the sales job time, they acted like they loved you, but it was just really they were using love to use you.  It was not a genuine love.  Now they can withhold love to get you coming running.  They can even say that when they punish you, that's them loving you.  So they try to make pain equals love or hurt equals love.  So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.  So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.  So love gets very distorted and it gets very cruel.  Hypersensitive.  Again, the little child, the little boy, you try to give any feedback and they just get defensive.  They begin to think you are just criticizing me, out to get me.  Everything is bugging them.  And so what they are doing is basically they are like, the whole world's against me and I am an army of one.  And now you are against me too.  And they polarize everything that way.  And they polarize everything that way.  And now you are against me too.  You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.  You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.  You begin to feel that you have unrealistic expectations of you all the time.  They always expect you to read their mind, to do everything perfectly, to communicate perfectly, all of that.  And it's just the bar is unattainable.  Insincerely repentant.  They vow they will never hit you again.

But I want you to realize this, they will, unless they deal with that deep stuff.  Just saying I will never do it again and promising and being full of remorse in that crisis moment does not mean deep change has happened.  So what you are looking for is not just words, but are they willing to do deep change and reach out for help around their deepest issues.  Intimidating and threatening will happen more and more, as you begin to realize their mask has totally slipped.  This is the real them.  I think I better leave.  Then they can threaten you to kill you if you ever leave them.  Final one, they lump together morally wrong behavior with human limitation.  So if you spilled the milk, that's just as bad as telling a lie.  If a child colors outside the lines, they make that as a moral rule.  A failure.  So if you come home and the supper's not quite perfect, they make it sound like you just cheated on them.  They lump everything into a moral failure.  If the house is a little bit messy, it's like you cheated on them.  And so everything gets made into a moral thing.  So 19 things there.  You may have just checked off every one of your ex's characteristics.  Hopefully you will pay attention the next time Prince Charming shows an interest in you.  Okay.  Next question.  We have kind of covered some of it.  Why do people stay?  I have had so many people come to me with bruises on their face saying I am never going back.  They move out, and guess what?  Two weeks later, they are back.  And so I go, what are the dynamics that cause a person who's got bruises all over to go back for more of the same?  So two categories here.  The first for many, and what I want to say, big picture with this, I will not try to oversimplify this and make it look like the person who stays is a failure or I am shaming them in any way.  I have been at this long enough to know that it is not easy to leave.  There are all kinds of forces at work, and it's a very complicated, complex issue.  So I hope I can communicate it in a way that you realize you are not being judged, but you are being understood.  So number one for many people is there's a huge fear of what the abuser will do if they leave.  The safety issue.  Will he stalk me?  Will he come after me?  Will he hurt me?  And that is a significant fear.  Secondly, there's a lot of guilt.  If I leave, they will fall apart because all they have is me.  And I am afraid if I leave, they are going to go into a huge relapse and they are going to mess up their life.  They need me.  And so there's a lot of guilt that a lot of people have.  And the abuser can often say to you, you are the only one I have.  You are the only one who gets me.  You are the only one that understands me.  I cannot get sober without you.  That sounds great, but that's a lie.  They can get sober, and there are other resources that they need to tap into.  You cannot be their higher power.  That will not work.  A big practical thing for many people is the children.  How will this affect the kids?

Let me just say this.  If you stay together with an abuser, you hurt the kids.  If you separate from an abuser, you hurt the kids.  The kids are hurt both ways.  The question is, what hurts them the least?  And I would say what hurts your kids the most is you staying.  Because at some point in time, your kids are going to resent you that you stayed in that environment and did not take them to a safer environment.  So you might think you are protecting the kids from going through a divorce and all the mess of that, but they can get over that a lot more than if you stayed in the problem.

But it is definitely a consideration.  A big one, money.  How will I live?  Do I need to get a job?  I do not know if I can afford to be on my own.  I do not have enough to get my own apartment, et cetera, et cetera.  So I am going to come back to that because those are very practical, very practical things that need to be considered.  Okay, how do people rationalize staying?  It's the same question.  It's just a little different perspective.  So here's what I have heard over the years because I have had many people who come to me for counseling who have stayed.  And they say, but he has such a good heart.  I just, if they just get that loved enough, then that good heart will come out.  And I go, how's that working for you so far?  They might have a good heart, but the issue is there's things that trump that good heart.  And you are not able to help them deal with those things.  And so that good heart is not going to come out as long as they stay with you.  Next one, who will help them?  All they have is me.  We have talked about that.  Third one, I am afraid they are going to go heavy into addiction.  And I just would feel so guilty.  Bottom line, you cannot keep them sober.  You might be able to delay their heading into deeper addiction, but they are headed that way now because they are not liking themselves as an abuser.  They are totally discontent, full of anger.  And so they are heading there.  You cannot prevent that by staying with them.  All they are doing is dragging you with them.  And so what you have to realize often, is somebody else might be able to help them, but I am not the person.  I am not strong enough to do that.  And so I have to get myself strong enough first before I can help anybody else.  So that has to be my focus.  Another common one is this.  I am planning to leave them, but I am going to wait till after we have our vacation together.  Or I am planning to leave them, but we have got to get through Christmas this year, then I will leave them.  You know what I have seen with them is three years later, they are still saying, I am going to leave them after this.  So that does not hold water after a while.  It becomes a way of procrastinating what you know you need to be doing.  If you wait for the perfect circumstances, you may never leave them.  So there's going to be times, there's going to be an element where you leave them, and it's not a perfect set of circumstances.

But to stay with them makes even worse circumstances.  Okay, now let me take you to some other reasons why people do not leave.  And I am going to take it a bit deeper for you.  I want you to think again of our limbic brain versus our cortex brain.  Do you know that abusers and those abused both tend to live in a limbic brain, which is the emotional brain, the emotional brain.  So life is decided by how do I feel.  So I will do something if I feel like it.  So what happens in a limbic brain?  You go, you just beat me up, I hate you, I am out of here.  Limbic brain just made a decision.  Two weeks later, oh, I miss them so much, I love them so much, I am back.  If you let the limbic brain make decisions based on how you are feeling in the moment, it's going to be a yo-yo relationship.  And you will never leave them.  So the point is this.  The limbic brain does not look to the facts to make a decision.  It looks to how I feel to make a decision.  The cortex brain says, yes, I miss them.  Yes, there's a part of me that still loves them.

But the facts are they have got deeper issues that if they do not deal with them, they are never going to change.  That's the facts.  And I am not the one to help them deal with it.  I have tried.  They have got to get outside help.  That's the facts.  So I am not going to let my emotions cloud my decisions.  I know what the right thing to do is regardless of how I feel on any given day.  So the cortex has to come into play if you are going to leave an abuser.  If you stay in your limbic, you set yourself up, to never leave or to leave and keep coming back.  Next thing is the shame.

I want to give you a different angle on this.  What shame is, is others did not respect me as a child, so now I do not respect myself.  So if somebody abuses me, I think I probably deserve it, or I think I cannot do better than this, but I am never going to stand up for myself.  So the point is this.  Until you respect yourself, you are not going to require anybody else to respect you.  If you do not respect yourself and you do not stand up for yourself, why should anybody else respect you?  They are just treating you how you feel about yourself.  And so you are only going to stand up and say no more to an abuser until you respect yourself.  Now let me go back to limbic and cortex.  Cortex brain says, I do not feel a lot of positive feelings for myself, but I know I have value, so I will stand up for myself even though I still feel unimportant.  I will treat myself with respect even though I do not feel it.  The limbic brain says, I do not feel respect for myself, so I do not respect myself.  So I never will respect myself because I never feel respect for myself.  So you have got to switch to the cortex and say, I do not feel respect for myself.  I do not feel respect for myself.  So you have got to switch to the cortex and say, I have value.  I am worth fighting for.  I am worth setting boundaries for.  I am worth getting healthy.  And I am going to start standing up for me.  Now that initially will feel selfish.

But that is not.  That is healthy.  That is finally giving yourself the respect that you deserve because of the value inherent in you.  The longer you stay in an abusive relationship, the worse your shame gets.  The lower your self-esteem gets.  Okay, a couple more things.  Practical guidelines.  What I say to clients all the time is this.  Do not leave an abusive relationship till you are ready to stay gone.  Until you are ready to enforce it.  Do not say, I am out of here and two weeks later you are back.  So think through a very careful plan about what you need to do in order to stick to that I am gone.  Think through your finances.  Think through your safety.  Think through the kid's situation.  All of those things come up with a well thought out plan so when you finally say it's done, you are going to enforce that and stick to it.  That is so essential because if you go back, what have you just trained the abuser?  You have just trained them that your no does not mean no.  You have trained them that if they say no, they can manipulate you over time to get you back and the next time they are going to try harder and it's going to be harder to enforce your boundary.  So think it through carefully.  Third thing, be prepared for backlash.  A narcissist does not like somebody saying no to them.  A narcissist does not like somebody saying, we are done, I do not want to be around you.  That makes them look bad.  So they can go on the attack.  Be prepared for that and that's got to be part of your plan.  I am going to stick to my guns even though World War III erupts.  And then be prepared for a variety of emotions that you are going to go through once you end it.  Yes, you will be angry for a while but then you are going to miss them.  And then you are going to feel love for them.  Then you are going to feel guilt.  Then you are going to be confused.  And then you will go through a time of grief.  You are not just going to be angry constantly, you are going to have a whole roller coaster ride of different emotions.  Be prepared for that.  Two final things.  And these questions I get asked all the time.  So let's say you are in an abusive relationship and you say it's done.

But they say, okay, I will go for help.  I will go to REACT.  I will get counseling.  Should I wait for them?  That is a very tricky question.  Here's what happens.  If they go to REACT knowing that you are going to wait for them and they go through REACT and they come back, how do you know they did it for the right reasons?  Did they do it for you or did they do it to get you back?  Or did they do it for themselves or did they do it just to get you back?  So you are not going to ever know that they are going to do it for themselves until you are out of the picture.  As long as you are still in the picture, you are always going to wonder are they truly sincere in their desire to change?  Or is this another smoke screen to make it look like they are trying to get help when they are really just trying to reel me back in?  The next one, if you end it, is it ever possible one day to get back together?  I would say in very, very rare occasions.  Usually, once you would try to get back together, it's too easy to go back to the old behaviors where you left off.  And you all know each other's baggage.  And so it just is such a difficult thing.  So what I say to clients is this, you might not feel that you can say it's done forever.  I get that.

But at least agree that it's done for a long period of time.  Give yourself a year at least.  Then maybe in a year your feelings will have changed and at that point you can say it's done forever.  You cannot say that now, so let's do it in a two-step process.  And let's just get through a year of this is done and then see where you are at.  So if you are in a relationship with a person that's beginning to show those characteristics, I really hope that you can say, I am worth fighting for and protecting.

I want to end this before it gets really nasty because I know where this can go.  And it's probably where it will go.  So I hope that gives you a little bit of practical stuff.  That's the end of part one.  We are going to have Melissa, Reagan and Bruno come on up.  And sing again.  Then we are going to go into the.  So I want to take the Christian part and this anger series in a little different direction tonight, which might surprise you, but I actually want to talk about prayer.  And what I have found over the years of working with people with complex trauma who come out of families that produce complex trauma is that often they see God as being kind of like their parents.  So if their parents were unavailable, neglectful, distant, they kind of picture God as being that way.  If their parents were angry and abusive, they kind of picture God as an angry God.  And so that has a profound effect on how they approach prayer.  Okay?  Second piece with this prayer is I would think is.  I have seen as people decide I want a relationship with God, one of the first things that they have questions about and are very confused about is prayer.  So they go, do I cross myself?  Do I have to pray a certain way?  Do I have to get on my knees?  Do I have to end in Jesus' name?  Do I got to make sure I go on a certain order?  And they get themselves all in a tizzy and a knot about how to pray.  And then they hear some wacko who says they got to do it a certain way then they feel all guilty and God must be disappointed in me.  And it just becomes a very difficult topic for them.  So I want to talk about prayer from those two vantage points.  And I hope that it just helps you get some insight and helps you in your own journey.  So I want to say in Matthew 6 is written, is where the Lord's Prayer is recorded.  And so a lot of 12-step groups still end by saying the Lord's Prayer together.  Many of you grew up in school saying it and it's one of the most well-known prayers in the world.  What people do not know is before he starts the Lord's Prayer, he talks about the abuses of prayer or the dangers people have when they start looking at prayer in their life.  And what you are going to see is that Jesus is going to address the very things that I have talked about right up front and it will hopefully be refreshing.  So misuse number one is people use prayer as an image thing.  So you might have a person who gets all pious when they pray and they talk in a little different voice and they use different words and they act super spiritual and you go, whoo, that is some super Christian.  And it's all based on how they pray.  And then they can tell you, I pray for an hour every morning.  And you go, wow, I am impressed with this person.  And you know what?  They may be a total hypocrite.  And so the first thing Jesus says is this, when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly, on street corners and in the synagogue where everybody can see them.  So the religious leaders of that day purposely went to the busiest street corner of town and prayed loud.  So everybody would stop and go, wow, look at that person.  It was all to feed their ego.  When you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you and pray to your Father in private.  And remember he's not saying you should literally go and get in a closet and make sure nobody sees you.  He's talking about your heart attitude.  That your heart attitude in prayer is this is not being done for spectators.  This is being done to communicate with God.  So that becomes the heart thing.  So that's abuse number one.

But the second one is the main one he talks about.  And it really brings in talking about tonight do you realize that Jesus grew up in a crop in a complex trauma world and it was a shame-based world so that the predominant belief in all the world religions at the time of Jesus was that that God was a distant angry being so therefore the purpose of prayer was to manipulate that God so that's an angry God who does not want to give you anything he just wants to punish you so how do you get him to give you good things and not punish you you use prayer to manipulate them so they developed all kinds of things about how to pray to get God to give you what you want does not that sound like today a little bit so a lot of churches sadly today prayer has become nothing more than how can you manipulate God to give you what you want and so I can get really worked up at times around this abusive prayer that I see in churches today because it is so prevalent so here's what Jesus says when you pray do not babble on and on as the pagans do they think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again again do you know what I hear sometimes today is keep asking God keep asking God badger God with the same request and then he will give it to you that's what he's saying do not do and then he says do not be like them for your father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him so he is saying what's the point of prayer it should not be just a shopping list where you say God give me this this to this and this he already knows what you need you do not need to report a shopping list but that is what he has become the focus in many churches around God so let me give you some of the things they use today to tell you how to manipulate God so they will put it in terms of how to have authority and prayer how to have power in prayer and it sounds great but for many people it's still seeing God as a a disinterested deity that you somehow have to cajole and they are giving you just these nice things but so I can take out all the Kubbr fans the support for you and kind ofines the you what you want so number one is they take john 14 14 that says jesus says you may ask for anything in my name and i will do it and so what they say is you have to pray in jesus name so if you listen to 99 of christians today when they pray they end their prayers by saying in jesus name amen do you realize that's not what jesus was saying here do you not know what it meant to pray in jesus name so it was the son praying in the son's name to the father so if i was a friend of the son and i wanted to make a request to the the friend's father the son's father i would not go and say give me something that your son would never want but i will pray in his name and that way you will give it to me no it meant pray what my son would want line up your desires with his so you are praying as if it's him praying for things so that's what praying in jesus name means so if you ever listen to me pray i never answer my and my prayers in jesus name because in my mind it's time to get rid of that bad thinking that's not what that means it really is praying in line with what jesus would want but some people say if you claim it in jesus name and claim his name that will give you power with god that is an abuse of that whole verse second thing they say matthew 21 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask so they say just have faith okay now what they would say like i got a guy that did this okay he went to a friend and he says i have faith god is going to give me a quarter of a million dollars so i am going to pray and trust god's going to give me a quarter million dollars and has him as a scribe and i knew he claimed all his money and so the first thing you should do is write got a give a quarter of a million and then you should give god a quarter of a million dollars whatever it is that you want to extend your prayer if god wants to in jesus name and i am not saying i am going to do this that's pretty difficult it's better to do it in your own way so let's focus on that so this is the first thing if you do this properly because as far as being pious as to what the mind thinks about in this page i will give you a lot of information but i also what you have promised it is not saying i want this so i am going to trust you as a way of manipulating you so it's another abuse of a biblical term but what i want you to see is they are all based on god is a remote disinterested deity who's often angry who does not really care about your needs so prayer is the way to manipulate him do you realize how opposite that is of god's true character so let me take you to then what is prayer about if you want to think of prayer change it out of a religious language and just say this prayer is communication between two friends so when i go home and talk with my wife you could go say i go home and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife.  We just communicate, okay?  Now take that further.  When I go home and talk with my wife or I pray, I do not go and say, here's my shopping list.  Would you please do this?  Will you please do this?  I know you really do not like me, but would you mind giving me a hug today?  I do not go like that.  And I do not go and say, my dear great wife, I get on my knees and please bless me today.  I go and share my heart.  It is heart communication.  It is heart openness.  I can go for weeks without asking for anything.  I spend time telling her how I am doing.  I ask not for something I want, but I ask how she's doing.  It is a way of connecting hearts and deepening intimacy and getting to know each other better.  That is what prayer is designed to be.  Now let me take that further.  In a relationship that's healthy, most of our communication is spontaneous.  I will go home tonight and I will just say, how are you feeling?  And we will connect.

But it's not just spontaneous times of talking.  We also have a set time each week that we set aside just to make sure we talk at a deep level.  So prayer does not just have to be, I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.  I am going to do this at six o'clock every morning for 15 minutes.  Then I have done my prayer.  Do you realize that often I wake up and I realize I was praying as I came into consciousness?  And I pray subconsciously throughout the day.  Sometimes it comes to my conscious mind.  And then I have set times where I talk to God.

But most of the prayer is just spontaneous, instantaneous as things are going on in my day.  It is communication.  Now let me take that a step further because there's a very key thing.  When you look at the Lord's Prayer, Jesus is actually not focusing on pray these words.  He is saying pray with these attitudes.  Nowhere in the Bible does Jesus tell you when to pray, how long to pray, whether you should be on your knees, whether you should fold your hands.  He does not go into any externals about prayer.  He only tells you the attitudes you should have.  If you have the right attitude, the externals will take care of themselves.  And you might have times where you just fall on your knees and that is just it's in keeping with what you are feeling in your attitudes.

But you might have other times where you pray as you walk, as you drive and that still the attitude is right.  So the focus of prayer is attitudes, not externals.  The danger for a lot of new people coming into churches is that churches tend to get preoccupied with external things.  And you do not want to get with externals and so they come in and they get told you need to pray at this time so many times a day and go this body position and they get all wrapped up in externals and jesus says no internal attitudes is what it's all about and that is the whole focus so if i went home and i said with a closed heart to my wife here's my list how are you doing today i had a good day tell me what you are doing tomorrow we just communicated no we did not we talked but the attitude was not there if i go home with the right attitude it does not matter if i am sitting on the couch if i am standing looking at her if i am lying in bed if the right attitude is there we will communicate and it will go beyond talking and so jesus is saying what is get the attitude right and what is it it's it's a longing to connect with god it is a longing for an intimate relationship it's a longing to have his heart in my life it's a longing for a life that is dependent and growing in a relationship with him that's the longing and prayer just put words to that so here's a quote i came across that i love true prayer is not first external words it is a longing to connect with god it is a heart attitude the external words have meaning only if they express the right heart attitude the concern of god is not that you say the right words but that you long for the right things it's your heart condition that's his concern now one of the things that i often do with addicts when they start talking about this is i say how many of you have had times in your life where there's been a groan in your heart that is so deep you cannot find words for it it's just a groan and they all put up their hands because you have had that pain that depression and so i say that at times in my life is how i pray i will go home and i say to kim it was a groan day and she knows what i mean she knows that there was a pain and a longing so deep i could not find words for so just a groan came out and here's what i have confidence in in romans 8 god says he hears our groans and he puts words to them for us so he interprets groans and knows what we are actually praying for sometimes i pray without saying words at all or even groaning i listen to music and i just feel my heart starting to warm and adore and open up to god that's prayer that's communicating all of those become good one of the reasons i love the psalms and we have been going through some of the psalms is the psalms was a a songbook we talked about that but it was also a poetic journal but it was also a prayer journal and what you find in the prayers of the psalms is raw honesty real authenticity real emotions and like i said last week when we talked about being angry at god god wants us to be real and authentic he wants us to process that but that's what prayer is expressing i am struggling today god i am having a bad day i am really upset today with you because i am not sure what you are doing i am really feeling a lot of anxiety and i do not know what to do with it you are just talking it out i got asked this week this question i will end with this they said tim you are a very reserved person you do not express visibly a lot of emotions you are pretty level guy what do you do when you feel strong emotions so i said first you need to understand i feel strong emotions but in a leadership role you got to have a lot of filters to before you can express some of that so they said what do you do with those strong emotions if you cannot express them i go that's one of the key parts of my relationship with god i can take whatever powerful emotion i have and the first place i go is up and i talk to him about it i express it and that helps me regulate and process a lot of those deep painful emotions so i hope that helps you on prayer do not get hung up on doing it a certain way or getting it right just get hung up on i want to get to know this god and have a relationship and let come out what comes out well i got to add one more thing so if to time you are wanting to pray wear this il Мосkwik as the time of time in this message prior to coming out of the church one of the other things that i am getting criticized for but most of you appreciate is that i strongly believe the bible God and they would drop an F-bomb here and they are just letting it out and all the Christians are going oh they cannot talk like that I says yes God's good with that they are just being real in their prayer life they are just talking with the best adjectives they know and God loves that.
