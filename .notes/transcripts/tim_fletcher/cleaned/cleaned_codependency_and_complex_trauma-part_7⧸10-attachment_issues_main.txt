Tonight, I want to come at codependency from another angle that I think is a super important angle, and that is people who have codependency are people who did not connect well in childhood.  And I want to develop that tonight because it's so important, because the flip side of that is simply saying this, if I want to deal with my codependency and get healthy, I have to learn how to connect with people in healthy ways.  And so what happens with a child, and if you have complex trauma, one way to understand complex trauma is that when you needed to connect with your parents, you could not.  And so because of that, you felt all alone, you felt abandoned, you felt like they did not care.

But you also felt it's your fault, that the reason I cannot connect with them is not that there's something wrong with them, but there's got to be something wrong with me.  And then you internalize that and say, I must not be lovable or valuable.  It's all my fault.  And so complex trauma and codependency both come from this not connect place as a child.  And that leads to how?  A child perceives themselves, and that's the shame message that's behind codependency, that I am not good enough.

But then what I want to look at tonight is it begins to shape how you go about trying to connect with people in adult life.  And so what we are going to look at tonight is the different styles that children develop in order to try and connect, but try to keep themselves safe.  At the same time.  And so as you can imagine, it's solutions that seem to work, but that do not really work.  And so they create codependent relationships, which end up causing a lot of trouble.  So lack of connection affects how a child perceives themselves.  It affects how they go about relationships.  And it affects how they regulate their emotional world.  And I am going to develop that in a sense.  I am going to develop that in a sense.  And I am going to develop that in a sense.  And I am going to develop that in a sense.  A minute, but what I want you to just think about tonight is we are going to look at what psychologists have defined as three ways that complex trauma children begin to try and form connections.  They are not really healthy, but they seem to work when they are younger.  And then when you get to adult life, they end up causing you to be wounded, the other person to be wounded, and they do not work at all.  So that's what we are going to look at.

But let me back up and just give you a little bit of background on this term connection or the technical term is attachment.  So what do we mean when we talk about connecting or attaching in a healthy way?  What I do in thinking about this is what would it be like if a child felt so sick, safe, that they could drop all their guards, all their masks, all the walls around their heart, they would be able to be able to be emotionally connected to somebody who was emotionally available.  Also with that, they would need to have their needs met in order to feel that safety, in order to be able to drop their guard.  So they would need to feel totally accepted.  They would need to feel totally accepted.  They would need to feel totally accepted.  They would need to feel unconditional love.  They would need to feel respected.  They would need a relationship that was consistent for them and that was fair and there was honesty.  Then they could be authentic.  So what I have said in the past is this.  Children do not lie because they decide it's a good idea.  They lie to survive.  Children want to be authentic, but in an unsafe environment, they cannot survive.  They cannot survive.  They cannot survive.  They cannot survive.  They cannot be authentic because if you are authentic, you get hurt.  And so they learn to not be authentic.  And so the question of connection is, you cannot connect in a healthy way unless you live in a safe environment where you can be totally authentic.  And I think what you can see right up front is that children raised in complex trauma cannot form that connection.  Not because they do not want to.

But because it's not safe to be authentic.  And so that's what we are talking about.  So if I take that a little bit further, children need that connection all the time, but they need it most when they are feeling afraid or when they see danger or when they are feeling unsettled or uncomfortable.  Because built into a child is if I am feeling danger and if I am feeling unsettled or uncomfortable, I want to run to a person who is safe and connect with them so that they can protect me.  And so they feel the need for connection most in times of trouble.  That usually does not happen in complex trauma or it happens very inconsistently.  And so again, a child is not able to form a consistent healthy relationship.  And so they need to be authentic.  And so they need to be authentic.  And so they need to be saliva-cream-only, who 있고 I do not know.

But the more than that, they can start a barter of information compacted.  Ugh, you water drift.  It's really, really close.  I am kind of execute the process before one tire but I am more than happy to hire them at the hospital.  So.  The second half.  What about now?  Realize, no, I want connection.  And as far back as you can think or remember, you can remembering wanting to feel part of, wanting to belong, wanting to feel a connection with somebody.  So it is built into us.  What is fascinating to me is this.  When you look at the effects of drugs and alcohol, do you want to know what emotions they create inside of a person?  The emotions of connection.  And so what happens inside of a person is if they cannot connect to a person, they will connect with something.  And that will be either an activity or a chemical.  Because both of them will give them the feelings of connection without the risk of healthy connection.

Now, if you are going to make it in recovery, you can no longer be connecting to a chemical because that no longer works.  You have to begin to learn how to connect with safe people in a healthy way.  And that's where we are going to get into at the end of our talk tonight.  Next thing I want you to think about is the value of connection in times of danger.  So what happens to a child in a healthy home when they get upset?  So the term we use is their emotions become dysregulated.  So they do not regulate their own emotions because they are panicking.  They are afraid and they are starting to freak out and all of that and crying and they run to mom or dad.  And if it's a healthy mom or dad, they take their cues from mom and dad about how mom and dad respond.  And if mom and dad are not being freaked out by the events but are calm because they have the tools to deal with it, then the child takes comfort from the fact that mom and dad are regulated.  And then they regulate themselves.  So as they learn from mom and dad and how mom and dad deal with problems and are able to regulate their emotions, it imprints into their nervous system the tools for regulating stress, discomfort, fear, all of those emotions.  So that when they get to adulthood, they do not need mom and dad to help them regulate anymore.  They can regulate themselves.  Now if you take somebody from complex trauma, one of the big things that comes out of more severe complex trauma is borderline personality disorder.  And what is the key characteristic of that?  They cannot regulate their emotions once their fear gets triggered.  They go from zero to a hundred in a nanosecond.  They become irrational.  And they do not know how to regulate their emotions.  They do not know how to regulate their emotions.  So they are still at a child's ability when it comes to regulating their emotions.  So attachment, healthy attachment, leads to regulation of emotions.  Such an important thing.  What I want you to understand through all of this is if a child does not attach, you get the abandonment feeling that happens, which leads to the shame feeling, which leads to problems regulating emotions, which leads to problems with relationships, with conflict, all of that stuff.  So here's a couple things that have been written.  I just wanted to read them to you.  Moderately to severely dysregulated nervous systems can lead to addictive behaviors in adulthood.  And all of you can relate to that.  Then the next one is this.  Love or relationship problems.  Love or relationship addicts, which is codependency, are chronically dysregulated.  In other words, if you want to understand one of the characteristics of a codependent relationship, look for emotional dysregulation.  One or both will be dysregulated when they get triggered.  And then they trigger each other.  And then they just escalate, escalate higher and higher.  And then you have got a gong show on your hands.  And most of you have been there.  So what I want you to understand is this.  Codependency is all about problems in attaching in childhood.  It goes back to that very core thing.  So you go, okay, how do I know two things?  If I had a decent attachment growing up.  Or secondly, how do I know that?  Secondly, how do I know if I am attaching to my children?  Because I want to form a healthy attachment with my children.  So there's really four things that disrupt healthy attachment.  So the technical term is healthy attachment.  We call secure attachment.  So the child feels very secure because they feel safe, loved, accepted, valued, respected.  That's secure attachment.  They can drop their guard.  They do not need any masks.  They do not feel they have to walk on eggshells.  They can be totally authentic.  Okay?  Unhealthy is insecure attachment.  So four things that disrupt it.  So we start with the stages of development in a child.  So most of you attached to your newborn baby.  That infant, you held them.  You nursed them.  You cooed over them.  You spent as much time as possible with them.  You kept their life safe.  You met all their physical needs.  And you worked hard to attach.  Okay?  What I want you to see as we go through this is we are going to look at five different stages of development in a child.  For a child to have secure attachment, they need to feel connected in all five stages.  If you only connected in one or two stages, but not in all five, then the child will pick up insecure attachment.  Okay?  So stage two is toddlerhood as they begin to walk.

But what I want you to understand about toddlerhood is all of a sudden this child is a little harder to manage.  Because they are into everything and they are exploring and they are curious and they do not really have very good boundaries.  Okay?  So they are in their own boundaries on their own.  And then you go into the child as they go off to school.  Then you go to the preadolescent, 10 to 12.  And then the teenage years.  And so some of you might be sitting there thinking, I attach good in stage one and two.  And then after that, it's been downhill.  Do not go to beating yourself up.  Because what I want you to understand is that you can always repair insecure attachment.  If your child begins to feel that you are getting healthy and you are becoming safe, they still want to attach to you.  And so you can repair a lot of the damage.

But that's the first way that healthy attachment can be interrupted.  Secondly is inconsistent parenting.  So let me just say this.  I get a lot of clients, addicts, who come to me and say, I am a really good parent.  And what they mean and what I point out to them is that when you are clean and sober, you are a good parent.  The problem is you are not always clean and sober.  So to your child, they love it when you are clean and sober.

But when you are relapsed and back in the problem, there's no connection with you at all.  So inconsistent parents results in insecure attachment.  Third one, if you were uncomfortable about some topic because of your own issues, and you therefore would not let your child talk to you about what they were struggling with, you shut them down, then they felt all alone.  And they felt the connection with you break a little bit.  So everything that they have inside of them that they know they cannot talk to you about, either because you will go crazy or you will get angry or you will judge them, that breaks the attachment.  And then the fourth is when mom and dad split.  That disrupts the attachment.  Now I just want to add, if you are working on yourself, and you are separated, yes there's damage that's been done, but if you are working on yourself, a child that can attach to one parent is a wonderful thing.  It's way better than a child that cannot attach to either parent.  And so again, attachment with your child is not about gimmicks that you do to try to get them to talk to you.  Attachment with your child is about you becoming healthy and safe.  And your child already wants to attach to you.  They are just waiting for you to become a person they can safely attach to.  So let me go into the three types of insecure attachment.  And what these are, are the three different ways a child learns to cope with lack of attachment.  And that then comes into their adult life and it shows up in codependency.  So some of these you are going to understand from some of the stuff we have already talked about.

But the first one is anxious attachment.  So this is a child that is reaching out to mom and dad as a kid wanting to connect, but they do not want to connect with you.  And so you begin to operate by the belief that nobody will want to connect with me just the way I am.  Because mom and dad did not want to connect with me.  So as you come into adult life, your fear in forming relationships is rejection.  Your belief under that fear is that if people get to know me, they will reject me.  And therefore people will only connect with me if I wear masks, if I give up my needs, if I give up my desires, if I become a non-person, then they will want to connect with me.  Which is really no connection at all.  So what happens then to an anxious person when they get into a relationship is they do not get their needs met because they are putting those aside.  Okay?  Result of that, and a lot of this happens at a subconscious level, they are not happy.  Their needs are not met, there's an emptiness inside, there's a pain inside because of that.  And so their whole thought is, that person that I am trying to have a relationship with is the one I need to meet my needs.  So they hyper-analyze every little detail of the relationship.  So let's say that you have been in a relationship and it's been going on really, really well.  And almost every day your partner's quite upbeat and quite warm.  And then you wake up one day and you do not know right up front that they got a headache.  And so they are just a little bit distant that day.  What do you do?  Do you focus on the last month and how wonderful it is and then look at today in light of the last month?  No, you go, they are distant.  They are pulling away from me.  Oh, oh, oh, oh.  And you over-analyze it.  So you get this ton of anxiety.  You have this little vision that focuses on that one thing.  And then you start blowing it up in your mind.  And now you are going, oh, I noticed yesterday that I went to touch them.  They did not reach out and grab my hand and want to touch me.  Oh, oh, I think they are pulling away from me.  And they do not want close.  And now you are reading in all kinds of negative things.  So if you have been that person in a relationship or you have been in a relationship with somebody like that, that can drive you crazy.  Because now they want to analyze it over and over and they keep going to the worst case scenario.  Do you want to know what they are doing?  They are fulfilling their core belief that you are going to leave them.  They have already decided that.  Now they are just looking for evidence to support that.  And so the first little sign, it does not even have to be true, but it looks like it might possibly be true.  That fits their core belief.  And they run with that.  And so that begins to cause them to obsess, to question, to analyze.  And then they have to do things because now they feel more insecure.  They have greater anxiety.  So now they start playing little games.  They start playing little games with you to try and see if you are going to pull away more.  So all of a sudden they do not give you any attention to see if you will chase them.  And if you are not chasing them around, they go, see that proves they are pulling away from me.  Or they give you all kinds of mixed messages.  They do not return your phone calls to see how you will respond.  All of those things begin to happen.  And it's a person acting out of an anxiety place with a core belief that if you get to know me, you will reject me.  So some of you can relate to that.  Then the flip side is the person that we call avoidant attachment.  And so this is the child that's tried to be involved with mom and dad, but mom and dad just neglect them.

But the child does not want to become needy or full of anxiety.  They harden themselves.  And they go, I do not need anybody.  I can do this on my own.  And what they are trying to do is protect themselves from any future feelings of rejection.  Because they are trying to say, I do not need anybody so rejection does not bother me.  So this is the person that when they get in a relationship, they avoid closely.  So you got the anxious person wanting closeness, pushing for closeness.  You got the avoidant person keeping you at arm's length.  In their mind, their strength is that they are an independent, self-sufficient person.  And that is more important to them than intimacy because intimacy to them feels like neediness.  Intimacy to them feels like, I am becoming less of a person because I am less independent and self-sufficient.  And so they do not share their feelings.  They are not great talkers about that kind of stuff.  Talking is about, do you want sex tonight?  Or what's happening with the kids?  Business kind of stuff.  That is what's happening.  And for many of them, they have trouble committing themselves to the things that they are doing.  They are not committing themselves to relationships.  So they like lots of casual relationships.  They like lots of romantic relationships.

But that word commitment to them means lack of freedom, lack of independence, lack of self-sufficiency, which means I am going to get smothered or engulfed by somebody else.  And I will lose me in the process.  So they avoid that kind of commitment.

But if you get them to commit, once they commit, they like to create kind of mental distance by focusing on their partner's flaws and pointing them out.  Or they review with their buddies how great single life was and how great it was to have freedom and how they have got a ball and chain now, called their wife, that's holding them down.  And they begin to put their marriage in that kind of language to create a distance again.  So they resist intimacy.  The other person, the anxious person, is pursuing intimacy but overdoing it.  So those two types of things are happening.  So just as the anxious person was hypervigilant about whether the person was pulling away, signs of distance, the avoidant person is hypervigilant about the other person's attempts to control them.  So as soon as their partner says, would you do this for me, they get their back up.  Because they do not want to be controlled.  They are very hypersensitive to that.  They will engage in distancing behaviors like, I am just going to make decisions without consulting my partner.  I like that big screen TV for a thousand bucks, I will buy it.  I am not even going to ask them, I will just show up with it.  And they live by it's, it's easier to ask for forgiveness than permission.  And they want to create distance by that.  Or if their partner comes and says, you did not consult me, or you have not been talking to me, or you have not been spending time with me, they go, needy, needy.  And they pride themselves, they are not weak like that.  So you relate to that kind of thing.  So that's going on.  Now can you see, for some reason those two attract each other?  Okay, I am going to come back to that because I want you to think about that.

But before we get there, I want to give you the third type, and that's what we call disorganized attachment.  Disorganized attachment.  That's a child who grows up in abuse and they cannot find a solution to get out of abuse.  And so one day, they are reaching out to mom and dad for help.  The next day they are running away from mom and dad.  They are trying all kinds of different things because nothing's working.  And so there's no real patterns.  It's very disorganized.

But what comes core of their being, is this huge, huge fear of intimacy.  Because intimacy leads to conflict.  Conflict leads to abandonment.  And so there's constant fear in relationships.  And they will often give very mixed messages when they get into a relationship in adult life that comes out of that disorganized mind.  So one day they will say, I love you.  Next day, go away.  One day, I need you.  Next day, I do not need you.  And you are sitting there going, what in the world am I supposed to do with this?  And it gets very confusing for the other person.  Now let me just add this.  You can take all three of those things, those attachment styles, and you can go to the average person with complex trauma as they go to work, as they have casual friends, and you will not necessarily see those three things.  When you begin to see their attachment style is when they get into an intimate relationship.  And then all of a sudden, that deep fear, shame, abandonment, all begins to surface, and their style is affected because of that.  Okay, so let's go to this.  The anxious person, the anxious style, is attracted to the avoidant style.  I just find that very humorous at times as I watch it.  So let me give it to you this way.  The anxious one we are going to call the pursuer.  The avoidant one is the distancer.  So what you have is a pursuer chasing a person around, saying, please connect with me, and they say, please stay away from me.  And quit crowding my space.

Now, what I want you to understand is, they are not even aware they are doing it because it happens at a subconscious level.  And they are not even aware that they need to do it to try and meet some deep down need inside of themselves.  So the distancer, they would never admit it, because they think, I do not need anybody.

But deep down, they want somebody to chase them.  That is important.  And then the anxious person, the chaser, the pursuer, they need somebody to chase to feel that they are getting their needs met and getting attention and conquering somebody.  So you always end up typically in codependent relationships that come out of complex trauma a pursuer after a distancer, not wanting it to happen.

Now, I want to take that a bit further because here's what I want you to understand.  Do you realize if you were to take an anxious person or an avoidant person, so a pursuer or a distancer, and say, have a relationship with this very healthy person, do you want to know what they would say?  Boring.  They need the chase.  They need the conflict.  They need all of that compulsive behavior to feel alive.  So that's the need that is being met.  And so they are not ever attracted to a healthy person because that would not meet that need for that adrenaline and the chaos and the conflict.  So they go chasing unhealthy people with the same shame issues, just two separate ways of responding to that shame, one anxious, one avoidant.

But what I always want clients to understand is this.  That might give you a rush to be in a chase or being pursued, but it always backfires.  They never work out to be healthy.  They never have healthy relationships.
