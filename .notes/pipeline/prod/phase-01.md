## Phase 01 â€” Ingestion & Acquisition

Summary
-------
This phase covers data acquisition and ingestion: connectors, rate limiting, sharding, initial validation and storage. The objective is a robust ingestion layer that can accept multiple source formats and feed the pipeline reliably with backpressure and monitoring.

Primary goal
- Build production-grade connectors and ingestion workflows with monitoring, retries and rate limits.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Formalize ingestion interface (input contract) and submit to repository as `ai/dataset_pipeline/ingestion_interface.py`
- [ ] Harden existing connectors (YouTube, local, S3, GCS) with retries, backoff, and rate limit config
- [ ] Add host/URL allow-list and SSRF protections for any user-supplied fetches
- [ ] Implement ingestion backpressure and queueing (Redis or internal queue) and run a load test
- [ ] Create schema validation for incoming files and implement rejection + quarantine flow
- [ ] Implement ingest metrics (per-source rates, failures, latency) and add dashboard scrapers
- [ ] Add robust logging and structured event formats for ingestion events
- [ ] Implement deduplication at ingest stage (fast bloom filter or hash index)
- [ ] Add unit + integration tests for all connector adapters
- [ ] Provide `scripts/ingest-smoke.sh` or similar for quick local validations
- [ ] Document ingestion configuration and operational runbook in `docs/ops/ingestion.md`
- [ ] Secure any credentials used by connectors via env config and secrets manager guidance
