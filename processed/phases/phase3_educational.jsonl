We've been doing a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma and today I want to come at it from a different angle that I hope will be quite helpful for you. I want you to see that many of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma are actually tools that people with complex trauma use in order to cope with life in order to get things done. They may not be healthy tools but for most in complex trauma it was the only tools they were given and so they've accumulated growing up a toolbox of tools and many of the tools are the characteristics of complex trauma. So when it comes to how do we learn tools for coping and learning how to live in life, we really get it kind of three different ways. Our parents can teach us explicitly do it this way, here's how you handle this or we can just observe how other people handle things and so we learn by watching our role models or third we can be in a survival mode and so our brain just goes to what it needs to do to get safe right away. So an instant safety type of tool and what happens for most in complex trauma is they're building a toolbox of unhealthy tools that let them survive and cope in the short run but when they get to adult life those tools aren't working anymore they're causing problems now in relationships in jobs in parenting and so they need to revisit their toolbox and realize that many of the tools aren't healthy and then begin to figure out what healthy tools are and so what I want to do is walk you through the unhealthy tools that you may have picked up in your toolbox. So we're gonna go through your toolbox and you can check off the ones that are part of your toolbox as I go through lists but let me as a background just say this we need tools in three different areas specifically. So number one we need tools that will help us deal with extreme emotional pain so a deep hurt a deep loss, depression, deep emotional pain. So we will accumulate tools to deal with th..."}]}

I thought this Friday I would look at one of the characteristics of complex trauma that doesn't get talked about a lot, but I think it's important to look at. And that is the whole topic of intrusive thoughts. And these are kind of dark thoughts that just pop into your head, uninvited, unwelcome, and they're very different from your normal, typical thought flow throughout a day. I think it's important to say up front that they've done a number of studies on kind of how frequently these happen, how many people have this. And one global study says that 93% of participants reported having at least one intrusive thought every three months. And that held true for people who didn't have a diagnosis, mental health problems. So it's a very common thing to get an intrusive thought is the point. Everybody has it. The only problem is that for some people, it interrupts their life and creates a lot of anxiety. And so what we begin to realize is there's kind of two categories of people when it comes to intrusive thoughts. So the first category is the thought pops into the person's head and they just kind of ignore it and move on with their day. Don't give it any weight and it's not a big issue. The second category is people who have difficulty ignoring it. They begin to obsess about it. It creates a lot of anxiety. It creates distress. It creates shame. And so in these cases, it's often classified as a type of OCD. What I want to look at today is just maybe it's more a complex trauma issue for those people that they just need to understand the complex trauma part and where it comes from. What I think is just so sad for those that once they get it, they obsess on it. It creates a lot of shame. Is that for them, it just is debilitating. They think it makes them a terrible person. They're afraid to talk about it to others for fear that they're going to be judged or ostracized. So they just try to manage it on their own, which they're not doing..."}]}

We've been working our way through the 60 characteristics of complex trauma doing one week on each of the characteristics so we can do a deep dive and to really understanding that particular characteristic. And today we come to change in priorities and of all the 60 characteristics, this is probably the one that is least evident to understand just by reading change in priorities. So I need to begin by just explaining what this is all about and then show how it's still an issue for most people who come out of complex trauma. So here's the big picture. If you think of a healthy family, you have parents, children, and basically the priority in that family is love. We are here to care for each other, to meet each other's needs. And if we work together, we can all get our needs met. Sometimes it will mean that I have to sacrifice my needs temporarily in order to meet your needs. Sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs temporarily in order to meet my needs. But overall, the amount of sacrifice that takes place will be 50-50. Everybody will get their needs met with some sacrifices made. So that is the commitment of love within a family. We're all equal, we're all equally important and it's about loving each other, meeting each other's needs. And it's not one person who gets their needs met all the time, but never makes a sacrifice. No, there's a give and a take that is constantly happening. Now bring in complex trauma. Constant danger for a child. Constantly feeling threatened. In order to survive in that environment, a child has to say, the priority can no longer be loving others. The priority has to be surviving. And that means that my needs are a wee bit more important than your needs. That means that I have to be more important than you if I am going to survive in danger. And very subtly, a shift in priorities from love at the core to survival takes place. And what I want you to think about is the ramifications of that shift in prio..."}]}

We've been doing a series that's taking a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. And today we come to the instant gratification focus. And I want to develop and explain why it's such an issue with complex trauma and then show how it can really mess up people's recovery. And really be a hindrance to them in doing recovery well. So as always, let's begin with a definition of instant gratification. And there's two ways of looking at it. So the first is instant gratification is a habit where you forego short term pain, indulge in a fleeting pleasure that ultimately results in long term pain. So you give up short term pain to have pleasure but end up with long term pain. Other one is it's a form of self sabotage where you get caught up in indulging in the temptations of life at the cost of long term goals. So you get so preoccupied with getting short term pleasure that you end up missing long term goals. Or another way to say it just from a neurological standpoint, instant gratification focus is living with limbic pleasure, limbic brain pleasure as your main focus. And that is what ties us in to the complex trauma piece. But let me begin by saying this that the limbic brain as we point out time and time again is all about the child brain. It's the part of the brain that develops during childhood. And so what characterizes a child's brain is that they don't think in terms of long term consequences, they think in terms of what will give me pleasure now. And they don't think beyond that. And so a wise decision is considered one that makes me feel good, instant gratification. That's the focus of a child. And it's why they need parents who are living out of their cortex who can think through the long term consequences as they guide a child in their development. So now let's bring in complex trauma. So what happens in complex trauma is it takes the child brain piece a little bit further. The child brain is instant gratificatio..."}]}

We've just got into a new series. That's really a remake of an old series on the characteristics of complex trauma. And the old series had 60 characteristics and we're up to over 85 characteristics of complex trauma now. And what I wanted to do was just pull all of these characteristics together in a summary format so that you get the big picture of the ramifications of complex trauma. How it affects every part of life. How we cope, how we relate, how we see ourselves, our body, our immune system, our central nervous system, our brain. It's just massive. So we spent the first two talks talking about how it affects our body and our brain and our immune system or central nervous system. Today I want to come to what I think is the aspect of complex trauma that is the most damaging that has the most far reaching negative effects. That is the most tragic and that is shame that complex trauma reshapes a child's self identity from a positive to a negative. No, we've done a whole series on shame and I don't want to go through it again. I just want to summarize it. But what we're going to see is complex trauma causes shame and then shame is really where a lot of the characteristics then come from. They're the attempt of the person to hide their shame, to compensate for their shame, to feel better about themselves together. They're all responses to shame which comes out of complex trauma. So this shame is just a massive thing. The problem is, is that in our culture it's either not understood at all, not talked about a concept that's not even recognized as being important or it's misunderstood by many people. And so there's the majority of our culture that think they don't have shame. When the reality is, they're full of shame. They're controlled by shame. Shame is one of the most powerful negative influences in their life and they're not even aware of it. The common misunderstanding to me around shame is that people just think of shame as an e..."}]}

We've been going through a series where we're taking a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. And today we come to one that we call people from complex trauma, create what they hate, or they create what they're trying to avoid, or they create the opposite of what they want to happen. And it happens all the time and a common question is why do I do that? So before I answer that, let me just kind of set the stage by painting this backdrop. People from complex trauma grow up in environments where there's lots of danger, or where their needs aren't met, or where there's many violations of love. So there's lying, there's abuse. There isn't justice. All of those things are happening. They hate that aspect of their childhood. And they never want to see that happen in their life again. They want their needs met, etc. And so they start out with a determination, I'm never going to be abandoned again. I'm never going to be disrespected again. I'm never going to be lied to again. And then they move into adult life and they end up being abandoned again. They're disrespected again. And it happens over and over. So they create without realizing it, the very environment that ends up creating what they've been trying to avoid, or the thing that they hate. So let me give you a couple examples, just to help you understand it. So somebody that's been abandoned goes, that is the worst emotional experience to go through being abandoned, makes you feel like you don't matter at all. I never want that to happen again. So they get in a relationship, determine that they'll never be abandoned. But what they then do is they're super needy. Or they test the person all the time, or they try to control the person all the time. And after a while, the other person goes, I'm done with this. And they walk out of the relationship and the person feels abandoned again. Or I've had so many people say to me, I grew up and I said, I'm never going to be like..."}]}

We've been working through a series called A Deeper Look at the 60 Characteristics of Complex Trauma. So we're taking each of the characteristics and doing a deep dive on really exploring them and understanding them and looking at healing and what that means for people with complex trauma. And today we come to Impulsive. And it's again a very common thing that happens with people with complex trauma. And I want to understand why I want you to think about kind of the results of being this way in your adult life and then how to change and become more healthy. So let's begin with the definition. Basically it's acting before you think. Or acting without thinking about long-term consequences. So you only think about the instant gratification. You're going to get from this activity and you don't think beyond that instant gratification. So another way to say that is, Impulsiveness is basically making decisions from your limbic brain, from the emotional part of your brain, from the child part of your brain. It's making decisions that are based on emotions rather than careful thinking, the cortex part of your brain. So a definition and a dictionary is, Impulsive is motivated by emotion rather than thought. Spontaneous actions based on desires, whims and inclinations. So another way to say it is, people who are impulsive have poor impulse control. They have poor natural inhibition. Another way to look at it, and this one I find quite helpful for people, is Impulsive people tend to follow a cycle. So they act without thinking. Do stuff that they then regret. So they then go to guilt and then they obsess about what they did. So in other words, they don't think about it beforehand, but afterwards they think about it non-stop. They obsess. And so the goal is, let's start thinking beforehand and not afterwards because if we wait to afterwards, we're going to do tons of thinking, but it's not changing anything.

We're continuing our series on these 85 characteristics of complex trauma In the last two weeks we've looked at how complex trauma affects our emotions and today What I want to really focus in on is that the main emotion that comes out of complex trauma is fear so fear is just underlying Everything often people aren't even aware of it But it's because the child Constantly felt in danger. They couldn't resolve it. They were constantly in fear So it just got kind of repressed shoved down to their subconscious But it really runs everything and it can be a very general feeling of just anxiety Generous anxiety, but it can also be about very specific things Some they haven't even identified yet. They can't put into words But once it's explained to them, they're able to put it into words And so what I want to focus on today is really the fears that come out of complex trauma And so we've already talked about fear of being a burden or a pain Wanting intimacy, but it being afraid of intimacy wanting to hope but being afraid to hope and the fear of abandonment So I want to Give you a whole bunch of other fears that come out of complex trauma So one of the main fears is the fear of being hurt a child quickly realizes that when you're hurt It causes a lot of pain now in a healthy home Children get hurt. That's part of life But what happens is parents come and comfort the child Teach the child skills Help the child resolve the problem that caused the the hurt and the pain and It ends up quite well the child grows the pain disappears The hurt is Comforted and healed but in complex trauma when a child is living with People who are all in survival mode who are all Using maladaptive ways of coping the child is going to get hurt a lot And so they're going to be in pain a lot So they're going to be abused neglected laughed at shamed punished unjustly There's just needs aren't going to be met.

We are looking at a more in-depth study of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. Today we come to one that I think is just very significant. It's wanting to hope but afraid to hope. And I find this is such an important one for people to understand as they begin their journey in recovery. So let me begin with what a quote from somebody that says this. Hopelessness is the culmination of the many negative expectation a person has toward himself and his future. Additionally, it is a strong predictor of suicide. Both hopelessness and suicide have a close association with mental disorders particularly depression. However, depression usually causes negative expectations of the present while hopelessness causes negative expectations of the future. So it's really hope in light of the feelings of hopelessness. One way to define hopelessness which is what many from complex trauma experience at some time or another is it's a belief that the negative circumstances that I am now in, will stay that way forever. And so because of that they go what's the point? I might as well give up. There's nothing I can do to improve my situation. My repeated best efforts talking to people exploring different options, hard work, trying all kinds of different approaches. Each one has resulted in failure. So I guess there's nothing more I can do. It's hopeless. And we're going to develop how that develops in complex trauma. But let me just talk a little bit about hope because I think it's such an important comparison point when we look at hopelessness. So hope by definition is the hope that things will improve that if I do the right things my future will be better than maybe it is now. Now you have to understand that hope is not just wishful thinking. It's not a passive experience in wishing about a fantasy where I hope that okay I'll just sit here on the couch and hope that good things happen. No hope is actually active. It takes your situation and goes ..."}]}

It's good to have you again with us as we continue this series on the deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. And today we come to the fact that people with complex trauma end up having many insecurities. They're very insecure about a lot of different things. So let me begin with the definition of what I mean when I talk about an insecurity. So an insecurity is a feeling of inadequacy or not being good enough to handle something. So it's a feeling of inadequacy and uncertainty. It produces anxiety within the person about one's goals, about relationships, about ability to handle situations. So when you look at insecurity, I think it's helpful to realize that we have external insecurity and internal insecurity. So a child in order to develop a secure sense about life in themselves need to grow up in an environment that is externally secure. They know where their next food is coming from. They're feeling safe so their exterior environment is secure, but they also need an internal environment to be secure. And the problem with complex trauma is it creates an insecure external environment which then creates an internal environment that is full of insecurity as well. So if you look at your external environment today, it could be, do I have enough money in the bank? Well, I still have a job. Will I get COVID? Will there be a war? Lots of insecurities in an external world, but I want to focus mainly on internal insecurities that you may have. So those would be defined as something about yourself that you don't feel good about. Some characteristic about your body, some characteristic about your personality that you don't feel good about, and you're afraid that others will think less of you because of it, or that they will reject you because of it, or they won't accept you into their peer group or become your friend because of that characteristic. And so that characteristic causes you a feeling of anxiety or insecurity. ..."}]}

And I wanted everybody to kind of know what finding freedom was about. And so what finding freedom began as was seeing and saying that addiction is a problem. But if you look at it another way, it was actually seen as the solution to your problems. And so what were the problems that you were trying to solve with addiction? And so that's the underlying issues. And that's what we focus on because what we have found in what we have put into place at Finding Freedom at React Center is unless you start dealing with the underlying issues and getting healthy, your chances of dealing with your addiction successfully are next to zero. And so a term developed about 5, 10 years ago called complex trauma. And it's changed now to be their complex trauma or complex PTSD. And what it simply means, it's not a one-time event trauma. It's a child growing up in an environment of ongoing danger. So they're kind of in trauma or fight flight mode all the time. The problem when it's with a child is there's sometimes too little to flight and there's sometimes too little to fight. So they go to a third option we call free. So it's a 3Fs of survival mode. And what comes out of that survival mode are 50 different characteristics, 50 different things that happen as a result of a person living feeling unsafe. And that's what we've been developing over the last four weeks. And so tonight we're going to get to number 20. So we still got a little ways to go. But two weeks ago, before I was away last week, two weeks ago, I started to look at the fact that a person living in danger, it affects their thinking, it affects their emotions. And there's a characteristic of people in complex trauma as I don't want to feel anything. And they try to stuff everything down. But there are two emotions that they just don't seem to be able to get a handle ..."}]}

We've been doing this deep dive into the 60 characteristics of complex trauma and today we're coming to dissociation and It's one of those characteristics that many clients or many people who have complex trauma Don't initially see as being something that's true of them Until it's explained to them and then they go, oh, yeah, I dissociate And so I think it's important to start by saying that Complex trauma always results in some form of dissociation some form of disconnecting from yourself or from your circumstances So let me begin by just kind of Explaining what's going on here? So the original response in the brain to danger is fight or flight But the problem becomes for a little child who can't fight back They're too small and they're too small to flee or take flight So what option then does the brain have to keep them safe? And so we talk about freeze and what freeze really is is dissociation It you can't go into an external flight or fight So you flee into an internal world where you can disconnect from the external world That's dissociation So it's a it's a way of the brain trying to keep you safe by fleeing inward So it's important to understand that dissociation is on a continuum from mild forms of dissociation to extreme forms of Dissociation and what's important to understand too is that the greater the danger the greater the complex trauma The more one progresses along the continuum the more a person Dissociates in the deeper and deeper Protective internal worlds. So that is what dissociation is all about so let me give you some of the degrees of dissociation so ADHD is a form of dissociation for a child They are having trouble being present Connected to what's happening around them Connected to their internal world because they're worried about what's happening in their external world What's going to be happening tonight when I get home? What's going to happen at recess with the bully and so because of the external danger..."}]}

We've been working our way through the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, doing a deep dive on them just wanting to really understand what each one is about, how to change and heal so that we can become healthier people. And tonight we're going to come to wearing masks. And I should say I usually do some research on these topics on the internet and so I put in wearing masks. And I came up in 95 masks, et cetera, for COVID. And then I said psychological masks. And I came up with psychological effect of wearing masks and it was a really hard topic to research. So I just had to draw on all the kind of stuff I put together in my mind over the years. So let's get started. One of the things that happens when children in complex trauma have to wear masks in order to survive is they have to be somebody else than who they really are. They have to adopt roles. They have to take on personas in order to survive. And as a result of that, they feel like imposters that they're not authentic. They're not the real them. And so that's led to what has become known as a technical term called imposter syndrome. And so most people from complex trauma would have imposter syndrome. And here's just a simple definition. Imposter syndrome refers to an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be. In other words, because you have shame that's all part of wearing masks, whatever you the mask is you wear, you feel less than that mask. Somebody else has said this. Imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a phony. You feel as though at any moment you are going to be found out as a fraud, like you don't belong where you are and you only got there through dumb luck. A graph of or picture of what how to kind of put it in a picture form. So in the yellow circle is what you know about yourself.

Tonight, we come to the last of our Hady Five characteristic talks. And what I'm going to cover tonight are the characteristics that have to deal with relationships. Now we've covered a bunch of different relationships stuff already. These are kind of the loose ends that need to get tied up. So the first one is people coming out of complex trauma have grown up usually with double standards and relationships. So they grew up where dad could be angry, but nobody else could. Mom could have snacks, but nobody else could. Dad would swear, but the kids couldn't swear. Kids had to give mom and dad respect, but mom and dad didn't have to give the kids respect. So that double standard basically said to them that if you're an authority, you don't have to follow the rules. You can, the rules don't apply to you. You can do whatever you want. You're kind of above the law. So really two things come out of that that to me are really important understand. So that leads most people coming out of complex trauma to be very hypersensitive to injustice. Because living by double standards is basically life isn't fair. It's ones that are rules for one person, different set of rules for another. There's not a fairness. So there's a real hypersensitivity to any injustice in their adult life. But secondly, what many don't realize is that though they hate the double standard stuff, though they've been hurt by it over and over again, when they get to be adults and then in positions of authority often in relationships, intimate relationships where they're in a position of power, they often slide into this double standard without even realizing it. So now that they're the boss, they get to make their own rules and they get to make rules for others and often there's a difference.

We've been working our way through the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, doing a  deep dive on them just wanting to really understand what each one is about, how to change  and heal, so that we can become healthier people.  And tonight we're going to come to wearing masks.  And I should say I usually do some research on these topics on the internet, and so I put  in wearing masks, and I came up in 95 masks, et cetera, for COVID, and then I said psychological  masks, and I came up with psychological effect of wearing masks, and it was a really hard  topic to research.  So I just had to draw on all the kind of stuff I put together in my mind over the years.  So let's get started.  One of the things that happens when children in complex trauma have to wear masks in order  to survive, is they have to be somebody else than who they really are.  They have to adopt roles, they have to take on personas in order to survive.  And as a result of that, they feel like imposters, that they're not authentic, they're not the  real them.  And so that's led to what has become known as a technical term called imposter syndrome.  And so most people from complex trauma would have imposter syndrome.  Here's just a simple definition.  Imposter syndrome refers to an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as  others perceive you to be.  In other words, because you have shame, that's all part of wearing masks, whatever you're  the mask is you wear, you feel less than that mask.  Somebody else has said this, imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a phony.  You feel as though at any moment you are going to be found out as a fraud, like you don't  belong where you are, and you only got there through dumb luck.  A graph of or picture of what, how to kind of put it in a picture form.  So in the yellow circle is what you know about yourself.  And because you're wearing masks and being something that you're not, you end up not really knowing  who you are.  And so your circle of what you know about yourself is quite small, but you assume that everybody  else sees through your mask, they see and know a lot more about you, they know the truth.  Whereas in reality, they don't know anymore probably than you know about yourself.  But for a person with shame who feels like an imposter, the circles on the left are kind  of what goes on in their mind.  And so here are the characteristics of imposter syndrome.  So a lot of self doubt because you're just acting apart.  You fear that you won't live up to expectations and inability to realistically assess your competenc..."}]}

We've been working through a series called  A Deeper Look at the 60 Characteristics of Complex Trauma.  So we're taking each of the characteristics  and doing a deep dive on really exploring them  and understanding them and looking at healing  and what that means for people with complex trauma.  And today we come to Impulsive.  And it's again a very common thing that happens  with people with complex trauma.  And I want to help you understand why I want you to think  about kind of the results of being this way in your adult life  and then how to change and become more healthy.  So let's begin with the definition.  Basically, it's acting before you think  or acting without thinking about long-term consequences.  So you only think about the instant gratification.  And you're going to get from this activity  and you don't think beyond that instant gratification.  So another way to say that is impulsiveness  is basically making decisions from your limbic brain,  from the emotional part of your brain,  from the child part of your brain.  It's making decisions that are based on emotions  rather than careful thinking, the cortex part of your brain.  So a definition and a dictionary is impulsive  is motivated by emotion rather than thought.  Spontaneous actions based on desires,  whims and inclinations.  So another way to say it is people who are impulsive  have poor impulse control.  They have poor natural inhibition.  Another way to look at it, and this one I find quite helpful  for people is impulsive people tend to follow a cycle.  So they act without thinking.  Do stuff that they then regret, so they then go to guilt  and then they obsess about what they did.  So in other words, they don't think about it beforehand,  but afterwards they think about it non-stop.  They obsess.  And so the goal is let's start thinking beforehand  and not afterwards because if we wait to afterwards,  we're going to do tons of thinking, but it's not changing anything.  So Roger Zalazani said, I have always been impulsive.  My thinking is usually pretty good,  but I always seem to do it after I do my talking.  By which time I've generally destroyed all basis  for further conversation.  The damage has been done by then.  You can analyze it all you want, but the damage has been done.  You should have done the thinking beforehand.  This is a cute definition.  Impulsivity is something akin to spontaneously jumping  out of an airplane and not realizing  that you forgot something until you're five seconds before impact.  Somebody else said, most of the problems in life  are because of two reasons. ..."}]}

We're taking a deeper look at the 60  characteristics of complex trauma, spending one night on each one and I'm  hoping that again it's helping you understand yourself better and healthy  tools for changing and getting healthier, more healthier self. Today I want to  look at one authority issues and I want to come at it from the perspective of the  behavior disorder, the diagnosis of ODD or oppositional defiance disorder and  then conduct disorder and this has become a diagnosis that is becoming more  common with children and teenagers. So I want to look at that. So let me begin  with a definition. So ODD or oppositional defiance disorder is a disruptive  behavior disorder in children and teenagers characterized by patterns of  unruly and argumentative behavior and hostile attitudes towards authority  figures. So it can present to people watching that this is a very stubborn  child but ODD is authority issues and it goes much deeper than just  stubbornness and that's what I want to explore. I want to look at what causes a  person to have authority issues. Where does this defiance come from? And I think  the main reason is complex trauma. I think those with ODD and conduct disorder  usually have a complex trauma piece that until it's understood you're not  really going to understand why they do what they do because on one level ODD  doesn't make sense. Why would a person do that but on the level of the person  doing it it makes total sense and it's not just one aspect of having complex  trauma that can lead to oppositional defiance or authority issues. Let me  give you a list of things that take place in complex trauma that can  result in a child rebelling becoming defiant. So the first is parents that are  over-controlling and so the child is resisting the over-controlling. So I've  drawn a line on the left is the parent's control on the right is the child's  control. The bottom is the child as an infant and at the top is a child entering  adulthood. So when a child as an infant the parent has total control because the  child can't do anything for themselves so they totally trust the parent to feed  them protect them to meet their needs but as the child gets older the parent  gives up control and lets the child take more and more control of their  decisions so that by the time the child reaches adulthood it's flipped. The  parent now has no control over the child and the child now is total control in  their life. So what you see then is parenting is a process of going from  total control to giving up all control. But what happens in a family where the  chil..."}]}

And so research began and two years ago AFM published that all the research was in and that 97%  of addicts have this thing called complex trauma. I don't like the term because it doesn't explain  itself very well. What it means is a child grows up or is in environment where they don't feel safe  and as a result of not feeling safe they're always on guard, always in survival mode which means  they're ready for fight or flight and if they're too little to fight back and they're too little  to flee they freeze. So the three F's and so that is how they learn to cope that is how they  learn to survive and once they found drugs and alcohol they have found the perfect way for fight  flight or freeze. They can numb everything, avoid everything, it becomes the perfect survival coping  skill until addiction sets in and what was once their best friend becomes their enemy.  So what I said last week is if you take those fight flight freeze characteristics and begin to  break them down you end up with 50 different characteristics that people from complex trauma  use to survive but once they become an adult those things that help them survive and stay safe  now make their life unmanageable, now make their relationships fall apart so that they're not  able to experience healthy relationships or healthy living. And so what I have been working on over  the last ten years in my own teaching and in treatment programs is to develop and help people  understand that when you deal with addiction you're dealing with the symptom of deeper stuff  which is the complex trauma unless you can take those 50 characteristics and begin to learn what  healthy looks like you will never stay clean and sober and so recovery isn't just stop using or  drinking recovery to be effective has to be learning how to be healthy and that means identifying  the unhealthy coping things replacing them with healthy and so that's what we're doing so this  is designed to give you a self-awareness of how complex trauma affected you, shaped you,  created in you, who you are, how you cope, how you relate and then what you need to do to begin  to change that. So last week we talked about the first one and that was the most subtle deep core  thing that when you're in survival mode your priorities change and instead of being all about  loving people you're all about protecting yourself. So safety becomes priority number one but that  means that ..."}]}

My name is Anita and I started this program a little over four years ago  when my life had become unmanageable and I was a bottle of vodka and pills away from ending it all.  I stumbled upon Tim Fletcher and his teachings at the eleventh hour of my glorious  painful life and this journey began for me in earnest and as of July 2nd it'll be four years of  continuous sobriety for me which has been a first since I was like seven. So to continue on we're  on week four of the 50 characteristics of complex trauma. It's 50 characteristics of complex trauma  and the 50 characteristics are are benchmarks for us for somebody who has deep emotional complex  trauma wounds from our childhood. So when I came into this program I said well I'm not sure if I  have this complex trauma Tim that you're talking about so he says well check with me after you've  gone through the 50 complex complex trauma and I nail just about every one of them. So  we're gonna break down what complex trauma is for you that have just joined us here tonight.  So we define complex trauma a simple trauma is a one-time event so that could be like a car accident  or a rape or someone broke into your house and you were violated it was a one-time event.  Complex is something that's happened to us over a long period of time. So most of us that happened  when we were in our childhood usually from the age of that we can remember from five to about  15 years old so that's complex. The trauma is broken that we've broken down into four separate  categories the first one's abuse which could be physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse  and mental abuse. The second one is abandonment that's a form of trauma so a lot of kids they said well  you know what I didn't have this this kind of abuse growing up but you know my parents divorced  when I was five. I felt I felt like toilet paper on a shoe I was kind of not I kind of raised  myself the neighbors the older siblings raised me so that sense of abandonment over a long period  of time that causes deep deep emotional wounds for some kids they were put into the CFS system  that is huge abandonment issues they feel displaced they don't have a place where they feel like  this is my home this is my this is my grounding parents divorce could be a death of a parent  and then there's neglect some people say well I wasn't abused I wasn't abandoned well I'm  second youngest of five the parents decided at three they're done raising kids so me and my  little brother we were neglected we were raised by our older siblings so there..."}]}

And we started by looking at perfectionism and tonight I want to come to escape to fantasy.  Most or many of the clients that I work with would not see this as one of their characteristics  initially.  Well, once they begin to understand it, many go, wow, I didn't even realize I did that.  And this is a really significant issue for me to look at.  And that's really what I want to do today is just help you better understand what we mean  when we talk about escaping to fantasy, why people from complex trauma do it, and what  healthy looks like.  So let me begin with the definition.  It's said to be a self protective coping mechanism used by many abuse victims.  It's a way of mentally or emotionally leaving the situation or spacing out to enter a fantasy  world.  And this often helps to anath the size the person by relieving their present pain.  So it's a way of escaping out of pain and feeling better.  That's what it is.  But it's also something that becomes addictive and obsessive.  And so when a person becomes addicted to this escape through fantasy, it often is very hard  for them to let go, much more difficult than they expected it to be.  So another way just to say that is a person is escaping something painful and that could  be their circumstances, but it could also be themselves and we're going to develop that.  Or it could be painful emotions that they're wanting to escape.  And so it's trying to make all these negative feelings go away and replace them with positive.  And so fantasy becomes their way of doing that.  Let me give you a couple examples just so you understand what I'm talking about and  how broad this whole topic is.  So we live in a day of internet dating.  And for many people they meet somebody online and without really getting to know the person  at all, they begin to develop a fantasy of this person where they're madly in love with  them, this person's madly in love with them.  And it becomes this relationship that there's nothing in reality that is actually happening.  But in the fantasy world, it is developing into this wonderful relationship with a wonderful  person.  That happens.  Some people, as younger people, or even adults, still escape to fantasy about becoming  somebody great, a movie star, the most popular person in the class, the one that everybody  wants to date.  And the fantasy world is where they escape to feeling important and feeling loved.  Some people, when they go through sexual abuse, they're esc..."}]}

We're continuing our series on these 85 characteristics of complex trauma in the last two weeks  We've looked at how complex trauma affects our emotions and today  What I want to really focus in on is that the main emotion that comes out of complex trauma is fear so fear is just  underlying everything. Often people aren't even aware of it, but it's because the child  constantly felt in danger. They couldn't resolve it. They were constantly in fear.  So it just got kind of repressed, shoved down to their subconscious, but it really runs everything and it can be a very  general feeling of just anxiety, general anxiety, but it can also be about very specific things.  Some they haven't even identified yet. They can't put into words, but once it's explained to them, they're able to put it into words.  And so what I want to focus on today is really the fears that come out of complex trauma.  And so we've already talked about fear of being a burden or a pain,  wanting intimacy, but being afraid of intimacy, wanting to hope, but being afraid to hope, and the fear of abandonment.  So I want to give you a whole bunch of other fears that come out of complex trauma.  So one of the main fears is the fear of being hurt. A child quickly realizes that when you're hurt, it causes a lot of pain.  Now in a healthy home, children get hurt. That's part of life. But what happens is parents come and comfort the child,  teach the child skills,  help the child resolve the problem that caused the hurt and the pain, and it ends up quite well.  The child grows, the pain disappears. The hurt is comforted and healed, but in complex trauma, when a child is living with  people who are all in survival mode, who are all using maladaptive ways of coping, the child is going to get hurt a lot.  And so they're going to be in pain a lot. So they're going to be abused and neglected, laughed at, shamed, punished unjustly.  There's just needs aren't going to be met. There's going to be hurt, hurt, hurt, all the time.  But there's nothing that they can do to resolve it because nobody's given the tools, nobody is helping them.  The people that are supposed to be helping them are actually causing the hurt.  And so the child quickly develops a fear of being hurt and the child develops a belief that intimate relationships  always resulting getting hurt. And then the child develops a commitment.  That getting hurt is something to be avoided at all possible. So now they have a fear of getting hurt.  But they go now going to adult life, assuming that any intimate relationship will result in getting hurt,  and so as soon as the..."}]}

We're looking at the 85 characteristics of complex trauma. So the  way that complex trauma affects people, the way they learn to cope, the maladaptive  survival strategies that  kept the child safe, but began to cause problems in adult life.  Today, I want to look at how complex trauma affects the emotional world and  and just to say up front is, to me, in working with clients all the time, it's just very  sad to watch the huge amount of damage that happens in the emotional world, how we try to cope  with painful emotions that becomes very maladaptive and causes all kinds of problems in adult life.  So I want to just give you a bunch of the different characteristics that come out of complex trauma  around emotions. But before I do it, I just want to give you kind of a backdrop of information  that will help you understand all of these characteristics even better. So the first thing  to understand is that the brain is designed for really four feel good chemicals. So it wants to  have dopamine, serotonin, oxytocin and endorphins and those all come out of safety, connection,  their make a child feel very good. What happens with complex trauma when there's danger,  when the child can't connect, is those four chemicals are absent somewhat in pretty much in  the brain. And they're replaced with cortisol, adrenaline and opioids. So instead of getting these  four feel good chemicals, they're getting other chemicals that are trying to help them escape  pain. But there's pain is really what is happening mainly in the child's life. The reality for those  children, then, is they can't resolve the pain on their own. Nobody's helping them resolve the  pain. They're not old enough to have tools to resolve the pain. They can't escape the pain.  And so these negative emotions are there, but then they just keep getting added to, added to,  added to. So there's more and more pain piling up inside of them. The second thing to understand  is that emotions in a healthy situation and a healthy family are designed to train a child  in positive ways. They're like the lights on a dashboard. They tell you something's wrong  underneath the hood in your environment so that you can fix it. So when a child is in pain,  the emotion of pain or fear, what does it do? It pulls them to want to connect to mom and dad.  It pulls them to want to express their needs. It pulls them in a healthy direction that would  provide safety, healing and help them resolve. But what happens to a child in complex trauma?  They experience hurt and pain. The..."}]}

Tonight we come to the last of our  Haiti five characteristic talks and what I'm going to cover tonight are the  characteristics that have to deal with relationships. Now we've covered a bunch  of different relationships stuff already. These are kind of the loose ends that  need to get tied up. So the first one is people coming at a complex trauma have  grown up usually with double standards and relationships. So they grew up  where dad could be angry but nobody else could. Mom could have snacks but nobody  else could. Dad would swear but the kids couldn't swear. Kids had to give  mom and dad respect but mom and dad didn't have to give the kids respect. So that  double standard basically said to them that if you're an authority you don't  have to follow the rules. You can the rules don't apply to you. You can do it  whatever you want. You're kind of above the law. So really two things come out  of that that to me are really important understand. So that leads most people  coming out of complex trauma to be very hypersensitive to injustice. Because  living by double standards is basically life isn't fair. It's ones that are rules  for one person, different set of rules for another. There's not a fairness. So  there's a real hypersensitivity to any injustice in their adult life. But  secondly, what many don't realize is that though they hate the double standard  stuff, though they've been hurt by it over and over again, when they get to be  adults and then in positions of authority often in relationships intimate  relationships where they're in a position of power, they often slide into this  double standard without even realizing it. So now that they're the boss, they  get to make their own rules and they get to make rules for others. And often there's  a difference. And so it's so important to realize that what really is going on  with this double standard that causing this injustice sensitivity is this isn't  love. This isn't treating others the way you want to be treated. This isn't  treating everybody equally. This is not love. And so if we're going to get  healthy, we have to live by this love, not double standard. The next one is most  people coming out of complex trauma have trust issues. It's so important to  understand that children are naturally trusting. They can't meet any of their  own needs. And so in order to survive, they have to fully trust somebody else  that they're going to meet their needs. And children are very forgiving if  somebody lets them down, that they'll trust again. So thi..."}]}

Today we come to one that kind of carries over a little bit from last week, but it's new and needs to be looked at separately, and it's that people from complex trauma need distractions.  I often say that one of the worst punishments that you can give a person with complex trauma is to put them in an empty room all by themselves with nothing to do.  And they'll go crazy because they need to be distracted by doing something all the time.  I want to begin a little differently and just look at the cause of this right up front.  I think there's multiple things in complex trauma that set a person up to need distractions, but the main thing is  what does a child do when they have mainly negative emotions and they can't resolve them. They can't make them happy emotions.  Well, nobody wants to live, well, nobody wants to live with predominantly negative emotions all the time, and so you need to be busy. You need to be distracted doing stuff so that you don't feel.  And so one of the main reasons for needing distractions is it's a way of not feeling your emotions.  Another way to look at that is what comes out of complex trauma is you feel in danger all the time so you live with anxiety and fear all the time.  And again, it's usually at a subconscious level. You're not even aware of that and you're on egg shells, you're vigilant, you're always on guard.  And as a result of that, you've got cortisol in the brain. And cortisol gives you the extra energy through adrenaline to fight or flight.  But once you get cortisol and all that extra energy, you can't sit still. That energy's got to go out.  And so what happens in complex trauma is you got cortisol happening all the time. And so sitting still is very hard to do because you got this energy to burn.  And so you just have one distraction after another to keep you busy to give you an outlet for all of that energy.  Another aspect of complex trauma is shame. The child feels the reason I'm abandoned abused neglected is something's wrong with me.  And so what happens out of that is I no longer like myself. I no longer want to have a relationship with myself because I think I'm a terrible person.  And so the last thing I want to do is sit in my own skin. I'm not comfortable there. And so you need distractions. So you don't have to live with yourself. You don't have to be comfortable in your own skin.  And then there's anot..."}]}

We're doing this in-depth look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  The tools that children usually develop to survive in a world of lack of safety.  And then the very tools of survival become the things that make their life today have all kinds of problems.  So today we're going to come to trust issues.  Last week we talked about control issues. Today I want to talk about trust issues.  And it's just a massive issue for people from complex trauma.  And I hope I can explain it in a way that maybe is a new perspective for you,  but it just gives you a deeper understanding of why people from complex trauma have such trust issues.  And then also give you tools for growing in this area.  So let me begin with the definition.  So trust is the belief that you're partnering and put it within an intimate relationship  is concerned about your well-being and acts with your best interest at heart.  It's the belief that your partner keeps their promises.  Trust serves as the foundation for a healthy relationship.  And it allows partners to be vulnerable with each other and feel safe and secure with each other.  So just to give you an idea of how big this issue is.  Let me give you four examples that I encounter regularly.  So somebody might say to me I was in a relationship while I was in the problem of addiction  and my partner cheated on me but we're still in a relationship.  Do you think we can work stuff out and have a healthy relationship  even though there's been that having a fair cheating as part of our experience?  Very common question.  Or I'm just starting a relationship and I'm in recovery.  And the person I'm with is so jealous all the time.  They're always checking up on me, accusing me of seeing somebody else playing mind games with this work.  Or I've relapsed quite a few times.  And my relapses always involve telling lies, stealing, whatever.  Now my family and my partner don't trust me and don't believe that I'm serious about recovery or that I'm changing.  But I know I'm serious but this is causing so much stress in our relationships because they don't trust me.  Or I know I need to develop new supports in my recovery which means meeting people and coming to trust them.  But I am afraid to trust anyone.  I am afraid to build a healthy support network.  Some of you can relate to all of those four scenarios.  But it is a big issue.  So somebody said, what is the hardest thing to build?  What is the easiest thing to destroy?  And what is one of the most important things in relationships and life?  Trust.  Somebody said, tell a lie once and all y..."}]}

We're almost done our series on the 85  characteristics we have this week and next. And tonight I just want to pull  together some of the coping characteristics. So we've already talked about  different maladaptive coping patterns that come out of complex trauma in shame  in fear. But I just want to pull together the rest that we kind of haven't  covered yet that are again, the child trying to survive an unsafe environment  where their needs aren't met has to adapt. Those adaptations seem to work. They  seem to keep them safe, get their needs met. But 20, 30 years later, they  begin to realize, wow, they're preventing healthy relationships. They're  hurting me. They're hurting those I love. They're actually mal adaptations. So  what we know is that people with complex trauma develop fairly consistent  coping styles. Everybody's a bit different. Everybody picks and chooses their  different coping styles. But there are detectable patterns that come out of  complex trauma. So the first one is drugs and addiction and process addiction. So  drug addiction has kind of been stigmatized as this is a terrible behavior. We  look down at it. Process addiction is also addiction and its activities. So  often those can be stigmatized. But for some, you're actually get validated  like workaholism, people pleasing. So let me explain addiction in the light of  complex trauma. So complex trauma is a child who's living with their needs, not  met and with getting hurt. And so the result is they're in constant pain, but  it's pain that they can't resolve. And also because their needs aren't being met,  there's not just pain. There's emptiness that's there in the child. And they  can't resolve that either. So what happens is the brain doesn't like that. The  brain is never content. Can't relax as long as there's pain and emptiness. And so  it begins looking for solutions. Every solution that tries isn't working. But  then it happens upon usually first one of the twelve needs that seems to get  met by something. So the child that is sad, eats food, feels better. Now the  brain thinks the answer to emotional pain is eating food. Or they find sex and  they go, the answer to loneliness, emptiness is sex. Or they fall into a  relationship. The answer to all my problems is being a relationship. Or they find  an escape. The answer to getting out of pain, the answer to getting out of  emptiness is just keep going into this escape. And then the brain basically goes,  if a little bit of food is good, then a lot must be better. If a..."}]}

Tonight, I want to start a new series. In a sense, it's not a new series.  Number of years ago, we developed and taught the 60 characteristics that come out of complex trauma.  The 60 coping skills, survival skills, the tools that come out of complex trauma to survive.  What I want to do now is go back through a number of those characteristics in greater detail,  just to take it a little bit further in your thinking, and especially if some of the tools that we're going to talk about are your main tools,  just to again help you grow and understand better what is going on and how to become healthier.  And so tonight, I want to begin with perfectionism.  Perfectionism is a very common thing that comes out of complex trauma.  Often people don't understand perfectionism as having a root in complex trauma, and I want to show why,  and I want to help you understand whether or not you have that as one of your coping skills.  My first encounters, I think, where I really started to understand perfectionism,  is I remember a client about 16, 17 years ago, where he was asked to, all the clients were asked to draw a picture.  And this client, he would draw his picture, then he'd go around and check everybody else's picture.  And if he didn't think his was the best, he'd rip it up and start another picture.  And he went through several attempts before he was finally done.  Everybody else had finished their picture way ahead of him, but he had in his mind the perfect, the best picture.  You can also see it in mothers or fathers who are determined to have the best kids.  And so they look for proof that their kids are the best.  So they look at how involved they are in sports and extracurricular activities that they're more involved than anybody else.  They look at their report cards that they're better than any other kids.  And if one of the kids has a poor report card, they think about taking them to a doctor to find out what's wrong with them.  They focus on their body, their appearance, their accomplishments.  It's all about being the best.  I've seen clients when it comes to filling glasses of juice and wanting it to be equal for everybody.  But they will fill the glasses and then carefully check them.  And if they think ones are wee bit low, they'll add a few more drops.  And they'll take them a long time before they can let the glasses be delivered to the people because they got to make sure they're exactly equal.  Or a mother who is going to have some friends come to visit.  And so she wants her house to be immaculate.  And the kids, they want to play with their toys and the mother gets a..."}]}

What the latest  research has been showing us and it's quite fascinating to me and what finding freedom is really  built on is the latest science and research around addiction. But if you have an addiction and 97%  of people with an addiction have what we are going to look at as this underlying issue, a trauma  issue. But it goes beyond that. If you have major anger issues, major emotional problems, major  relationship problems, if you struggle a lot with anxiety and depression or if you've been  diagnosed with borderline personality, probably this same underlying issue is what is going on  inside of you. And if you have this buzz word that is called codependency, that will be tied in as  well to this underlying thing which we talk about as complex trauma. So let me present what  finding freedom is about this way. We teach that though many people say addictions of my problem,  we say in a sense we agree it is a problem, but maybe a more correct way of looking at it is  that you viewed addiction as the solution to your problems. In other words, addiction is a symptom  of deeper problems. And that's what we are going to be trying to explain and understand.  So in the last 10 years, there's been a body of research that has been started, much of it  kind of spearheaded by Dr. Gaber Matei from Vancouver who's written a wonderful book on addiction  called in the realm of hungry ghosts. And he began the research and he said everybody I deal with  who's an addict has childhood trauma. And that led to a bunch of research that happened in all  kinds of different areas. And AFM published two years ago that 97% of addicts have complex trauma.  So what I want to do is explain that tonight. And then what we're going to do in the next few months  is that complex trauma, if you have it, it results in 50 different ways of living, coping,  relating. Addiction is only one of the 50. So we want to look at the other 49. And for some of you  it'll be depressing. For some of you you're going to go wow, am I ever screwed up? I knew I was a  little screwed up but not this screwed up. But for others of you you go okay now it makes sense.  Now I understand why I do what I do. And now I understand that to heal from addiction and recover,  I don't just need to stop using, I got to get healthy in those other 49 areas. Because if I  don't get healthy there, those other 49 areas will take me back to using again or to our relapse.  So trauma by definition is simply being in a dangerous situation or situation that you perceive  is so dangerous that it is beyond you..."}]}

We've been doing a series on a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  And tonight we come to the topic of manipulation.  A manipulation is a word we hear frequently, but what I want to do tonight is help you think it through in more detail.  And to help you see that manipulation can have a variety of different reasons why people do it.  But I think one of the main causes of people starting to manipulate is complex trauma.  And that's what I want to focus on tonight is helping us understand that and why we do it and how to change that.  So let me begin with a definition manipulation is any attempt to sway a person's emotions or thinking.  So changing how they think or they feel in order to get them to act in a specific way.  Or it's an attempt to control others so that they meet what you perceive are your needs.  So they do what you want. And often at their expense.  So in other words, it's exploitive. It uses people. It's deceptive. There's a hidden agenda.  And it's an attempt to seize power in a relationship.  In other words, it is not a healthy thing. It violates love.  And we're going to see it does a lot of damage.  But the question is why do people manipulate if it destroys marriages, if it's not a healthy thing to do.  Why do so many people do it?  So let me come at it from the complex trauma perspective.  And let me begin by just giving you a healthy home and what it would be like for a child in a healthy home.  So a child comes into the world with instincts to be authentic, to be trusting,  to openly communicate all of their needs, all of their emotions, their desires, and their dreams.  And in a healthy home, they're listened to.  The parents work to understand the child.  And then the parents, as they listen to the child's needs and desires.  And all of their sharing, they then are figuring out from a wise mind what is healthy for the child,  what is best in order to meet those needs.  So in a healthy home, a child doesn't have to manipulate anybody to get their needs met.  They just honestly communicate everything about themselves.  But in a complex trauma home,  the same child comes with all of those natural instincts to be authentic,  to express their needs and desires and dreams.  And it's a different response.  Sometimes they're made to feel they're being selfish for having those needs.  And they're punished for that.  Or they're ignored.  Or those needs are then used to shame them and make fun of them.  And so they learn that they're not going to get your needs met by asking,  or by telling them your needs.  The only way to get ..."}]}

We've been looking at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma,  one per talk, because I wanted to go into a more in-depth  understanding of these characteristics.  And today, we're coming to addicted to chaos.  And so what happens in complex trauma  is that especially in the environments where there's abuse,  there's just a lot of chaos, a lot of unpredictability.  You never know what's going to happen on any given day.  You feel like you're walking on egg shells all the time.  There's just one thing going wrong or blowing up after another.  And so for people that grow up in that environment,  that becomes their normal.  And something in their brain wants to keep that going on  because that's where it feels the most comfortable.  Somebody has said this.  I get uncomfortable when everything is going well  in my relationship.  That's not normal to me.  Normal is boring.  And I don't know how to be in relationships that are like that.  I continually seek out drama because that's  what I know how to handle.  So I want to start by giving you a test  as a C if you might be addicted to chaos.  And just if you just get one or two that are true of you,  that doesn't necessarily mean you're addicted to chaos.  But if you get most of them true of you,  then you probably are addicted to chaos.  So the first one is do you usually yell and scream  to make your point?  Second, do you ramp things up in an argument  in order to win?  If you get sick, do you feel that everyone should know about it?  When you argue, do you ever break things or knock them over?  Does being calm or bored sound like the worst thing to you?  Do you feel bored, unloved, or confused  if your partner isn't regularly arguing with you?  Do you ever yell at strangers if you feel  that they are in your way?  Do you hate it when you are not the center of attention?  Is there usually a crisis to solve in your life?  Do you ever break up or threaten or break up with a mate often?  Are you usually the one who starts fights?  Do you sabotage life or relationships  when they're going too smoothly?  Do you like the gossip, especially when you hear  some really juicy news?  Do you frequently run late?  Do you overshare on social media?  When you have a problem with someone,  do you post it on social media?  Do you spend your time on social media letting people  know why they're wrong?  Are you easily drawn into sticking your nose  into other people's business?  Do you like to stir the pot?  And the final one, do you like the identity of being a shit  disturbor?  So 18 questions in that test.  How did you do?..."}]}

We're moving along in our series on pulling all of the 85  characteristics of complex trauma together in summary form and today I come to the last ones  that come out of shame. So what we saw is that complex trauma. One of the most damaging effects is it  changes the identity of a child from positive to negative. So it creates the shame identity that I'm  not good enough. Something's wrong with me. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable. And so that then  results in all kinds of different characteristics that come out of that which are the brain trying  to solve shame. The brain trying to feel better about oneself, the brain trying to get others to  feel to respect you trying to hide that true identity. And so what we've seen is there's over 20  different characteristics that come out of just shame. So today I want to wrap that part up. And the  first one I want to look at is manipulation. So in a healthy home, a child's able to be authentic.  They can trust that those in authority want the best for them. And so they openly communicate  their needs. They openly communicate their desires, their dreams. And they're listened to. They're  heard. The parents are understand them and get them. And so the child doesn't have to try to  manipulate anybody to get their needs met. They just communicate their needs and know that the  parents want what is best for the child. And the child trusts that. But in complex trauma,  it's very different. So the child follows those healthy instincts initially. They communicate  their needs. They communicate their desires. They're authentic. But those get left at. Those get  punished. Those get shame. And the child begins to feel something's wrong with me. I'm not good  enough to have needs as to be rejected. So they still have needs. But how do they get those needs  met? They can't just express them honestly. So the child has to begin to learn to manipulate.  It's the only way of survival. It's the only way of getting their needs met. Now we've done  an entire video around manipulation tactics in the boundary series. But let me just kind of give you  the highlights of the main manipulation tactics that a child begins to learn. So the one, the first  one is love bombing. And that is, if I'm super, super, super nice to you. If I give you lots of  things, then you'll want to give me something back. So it's a way of manipulating by being super  nice. And children learn to do that. They bring their dad coffee. They do extra chores for dad.  And then they want to ask dad f..."}]}

We are looking at a more in-depth study of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  Today, we come to one that I think is just very significant. It's wanting to hope, but afraid to hope.  And I find this as such an important one for people to understand as they begin their journey in recovery.  So let me begin with what a quote from somebody that says this,  hopelessness is the culmination of the many negative expectation a person has toward himself and his future.  Additionally, it is a strong predictor of suicide. Both hopelessness and suicide have a close association with mental disorders, particularly depression.  However, depression usually causes negative expectations of the present, while hopelessness causes negative expectations of the future.  So it's really hope in light of the feelings of hopelessness. One way to define hopelessness, which is what many from complex trauma experience at some time or another,  is it's a belief that the negative circumstances that I am now in will stay that way forever.  And so because of that, they go, what's the point? I might as well give up. There's nothing I can do to improve my situation.  My repeated best efforts, talking to people, exploring different options, hard work, trying all kinds of different approaches each one has resulted in failure.  So I guess there's nothing more I can do. It's hopeless.  And we're going to develop how that develops in complex trauma. But let me just talk a little bit about hope because I think it's such an important comparison point when we look at hopelessness.  So hope by definition is the hope that things will improve that if I do the right things, my future will be better than maybe it is now.  I have to understand that hope is not just wishful thinking, it's not a passive experience in wishing about a fantasy where I hope that, okay, I'll just sit here on the couch and hope that good things happen.  No hope is actually active.  It takes your situation and goes, how do I make this better and it sets goals? It thinks through options. It weighs out what it will take.  And even though it knows it's going to be hard work or rough going, it comes up with a plan that then that then gives hope to the person because they go, yes, hard work, but it's doable.  And so it's a very active approach to life. So it's important to understand that because for a lot of people hope is just wishful thinking.

And if you're here for the first time, research over the last 10 years has pointed to the  reality that 97% of people with addiction problems have a common characteristic of having  childhood trauma. And it's not just a one-time event, it's that they grew up not feeling  safe. So stuff in the home caused them to have to be on guard, walking on eggshells. And  as a result of that, they went into fight flight mode and if they're too little to fight back  or too little to flee, run away, they froze, they shut everything down. And then once they  got old enough to find drugs in alcohol, they found the perfect way to fight flight and freeze.  And so they become addicts. So that's why such a high percentage of addicts have the common  childhood characteristic of complex trauma or it's now being referred to as complex PTSD. And so  what comes out of complex PTSD is 50 different characteristics. Only one of the characteristics  is addiction. There's 49 others. And what we've been trying to make clear is that if you're going  to deal with your addiction, you can't just deal with the one symptom of complex trauma. You got  to deal with all the symptoms and get healthy in the rest of your life. And so we've been working  our way through the symptoms of complex trauma. Tonight we're going to do just two. And the one  that we're going to do is a really, really big one. And I hope it gives you some insight into your  life. But just set it up. I want to start by talking about two chemicals that are released in  the brain when you sense danger. So when danger is triggered inside of you, fear kicks in, your  brain releases two chemicals. Last week, I talked about one of them, which is cortisol. And that's  going to be the one we focus on tonight. And it's a really important to understand this cortisol. So  cortisol, it does a couple of things when it's released in your brain. So you have to imagine yourself  in a traumatic event. Cortisol is released and what starts pumping adrenaline. And what does a  adrenaline do? It gives you energy to fight or flight. You can fight harder and you can hit harder  or you can run faster than anybody else. So cortisol is a protective chemical. When you're in  danger, it fires off adrenaline to give you that energy to fight or flight. It does a second thing.  It burns the memory of that event into your brain. So I ask clients all the time, who can  remember where they were? 9-11, 2001. Basically everybody puts up their hands. They can remember  where they were standing whe..."}]}

We've started a new series where we're looking at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma in more detail than we've looked at them in the past.  Hopefully taking it to a little bit of a deeper level for you who are watching and are working on your own trauma issues.  And tonight I want to come to the third one I want to talk about, the fear of abandonment.  I would say that next to shame, this is one of the most devastating aspects of complex trauma.  Many people don't even realize the devastating effect that it's had on their life, how they look at themselves, how they approach relationships,  how it really takes much of life and makes it into negative stuff.  And that's what I want to develop today. So let me just say up front that there may be many of your friends who walk around and appear to be very happy.  But if you were to explore their life, you would find a deep fear of abandonment. That is probably from a subconscious level guiding some of their behaviors  and affecting their relationships negatively.  So let me begin by just explaining kind of how complex trauma results in this fear of abandonment.  And then we'll just look at whether you have the fear of abandonment as part of your life either consciously or subconsciously.  So complex trauma is not entirely the result of living in a dangerous environment.  What it is is living in a dangerous environment with no one to help you, so that you feel you're facing this dangerous environment all alone.  And so the ones that are supposed to be there for you, teachers and parents and people in authority are not.  And so you feel abandoned. You might have people physically in your life, but you don't feel that they're actively involved in caring for you, protecting you.  You feel all alone. And I think after my years of working in this field that the feeling of abandonment is probably one of the deepest emotional pains that a person can experience.  There's not much more of a painful emotion than abandonment.  Nothing says more loudly to a child that they don't matter than that when they are abandoned emotionally or physically.  And so it says you are not lovable, you're not valuable, nothing communicates the shame message louder than abandonment.  And complex trauma basically is about children feeling abandoned.  And so what happens with that is they go, they go, this feels so bad. I never want to experience it again.  And so they develop a fear of being abandoned again, but this is where it gets very tricky. They become an internal contradiction.  They fear abandonment and they work hard to prevent ..."}]}

And I wanted everybody to kind of know what  finding freedom was about.  And so what finding freedom began as was seeing and saying  that addiction is a problem.  But if you look at it another way,  it was actually seen as the solution to your problems.  And so what were the problems that you were trying to solve  with addiction?  And so that's the underlying issues.  And that's what we focus on because what we have found  in what we have put into place at Finding Freedom  at React Center is unless you start dealing  with the underlying issues and getting healthy,  your chances of dealing with your addiction  successfully are next to zero.  And so a term developed about 5, 10 years ago  called complex trauma.  And it's changed now to be their complex trauma or complex PTSD.  And what it simply means, it's not a one time event trauma.  It's a child growing up in an environment of ongoing danger.  So they're kind of in trauma or fight flight mode all the time.  The problem when it's with a child  is there's sometimes too little to flight  and there's sometimes too little to fight.  So they go to a third option we call free.  So it's a three F's of survival mode.  And what comes out of that survival mode  are 50 different characteristics, 50 different things  that happen as a result of a person living feeling unsafe.  And that's what we've been developing over the last four weeks.  And so tonight we're going to get to number 20.  So we still got a little ways to go.  But two weeks ago, before I was away last week, two weeks ago,  I started to look at the fact that a person living in danger,  it affects their thinking, it affects their emotions.  And there's a characteristic of people in complex trauma  as I don't want to feel anything.  And they try to stuff everything down.  But there are two emotions that they just don't seem to be able  to get a handle on stuffing down.  And the one we looked at two weeks ago was anger.  So there's this deep seeded bubbling away anger.  Always there like lava below the surface.  And once a while, the volcano erupts.  There's a second one and that's what we're going to look at.  Tonight and then next week, we're going to look at a couple others.  But I thought I'd begin by giving you a little graph  of the emotional life of two different children.  So the top line is the emotional life of a child growing  up in a healthy family.  So on the..."}]}

I want to start a new series, and it's going to be on the characteristics of complex trauma.  And you go, well, you've already done a series on this. So let me explain.  Seven years ago, the very first series that we filmed professionally that became part of the YouTube repertoire of videos was on what started  it was the 50 characteristics of complex trauma. And by the end it grew to the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  So that was seven years ago. And where all that came from was when I started over 20 years ago, I was working with people with addiction issues  and in a treatment center that saw it as a symptom of deeper issues. And we really understood it was childhood issues, though trauma really wasn't understood at that time.  But Janet White, it's a put out a book called the 13 Characteristics of Adult Children of Alcoholics. And I read it and I thought, wow, this really describes the people that I work with.  So I started using it in one of the workshops. And it really resonated with the clients. And what began to happen, though, is they go, I began to see other characteristics besides just the 13.  And pretty soon I was doing a workshop where we taught 25 characteristics of complex trauma. Then it grew to 30, then 40, then 50. And then we started the filming project and by the end it grew to 60.  So I've been keeping this list for many years as I've got to understand complex trauma better as I work with clients at an in depth basis where I begin to spot just consistent patterns that are consistent with what comes out of complex trauma.  And so I keep a list and write it down. So I got thinking it's been seven years. My list right now is about 85. So maybe we need to do a refill of this whole characteristics of complex trauma.  And so I've done in depth videos on many of these characteristics. The purpose of this is to bring all 85 together. I'm going to do it in a 10 part series that just helps you see back to back to back. This is what comes out of complex trauma.  If you want more detail, you can look at the other videos that are available on YouTube. I think it's important to start with where these characteristics come from.  And it's really an understanding that complex trauma affects basically two things. It affects every part of your what makes you human. It affects your brain. It affects you physically, emotionally, relationally, how we cope, our identity.  And it affects all of it negatively. And so some of these characteristics are going to be showing how complex trauma, the ramifications ..."}]}

When I started in the addiction treatment world in 2004, at that point in time, there  was one book by a lady named Janet Boytitz who talked about the characteristics of children  who grew up in alcoholic homes and she put 13 different characteristics.  And that was really the introduction to me to begin looking for characteristics that  a child has who grows up in an alcoholic or an addicted home.  And then as the whole world of complex trauma became more and more understood, I began  looking for common characteristics that people with childhood trauma have.  And so I kept a list that I gradually added to as I taught workshops and counseled and  dealt with clients and got up to what became the 50 characteristics of complex trauma.  But what you don't realize is that I've been adding to that list and so though we've  advertised this as 50 characteristics, there's actually now 60 characteristics.  So that's what I want to do in this final talk is do the final 13 characteristics of  complex trauma.  So the very first one in this set is almost everybody with complex trauma struggles with  depression.  There are two types of depression.  There's one where there's a chemical imbalance in the brain.  A child can be born that way, it'd be a genetic thing.  And that person usually needs medication to help the brain get the right chemical balance  and deal with their depression.  The complex trauma adds another type of depression.  And that is from a bunch of different aspects of complex trauma.  First of all, it's from a child that grows up in just very negative situations.  Life sucks.  There's a lot of things that are happening where they're getting hurt, that are being  frustrating, discouraging, feeling like failure.  And so their whole life has quite an imbalance of negative, greater than positive experiences.  And so that just has that circumstantial type of depression that just feels very negative,  very depressing.  With that, there's also the shame element.  So when you grow up in complex trauma, you grow up feeling that you're neglected or abused  or abandoned because it's your fault.  And so then you don't like yourself because you think you're not good enough.  There's something wrong with you.  And so when you live every day with that feeling of not being good enough, that's very depressing.  And then beyond that, there's all kinds of negative, powerful emotions like anger and  fear that you're trying to keep bottled up and stuffed dow..."}]}

We've just got into a new series that's really a remake  of an old series on the characteristics of complex trauma and the old series had 60 characteristics  and we're up to over 85 characteristics of complex trauma. Now, and what I wanted to do was  just pull all of these characteristics together in a summary format so that you get the big picture  of the ramifications of complex trauma. How it affects every part of life, how we cope, how we relate,  how we see yourself, our body, our immune system, our central nervous system, our brain, it's just  massive. So, we spent the first two talks talking about how it affects our body and our brain  and our immune system, our central nervous system. Today, I want to come to what I think is  the aspect of complex trauma that is the most damaging, that has the most far-reaching  negative effects, that is the most tragic and that is shame. That complex trauma reshapes a child's  self-identity from a positive to a negative. No, we've done a whole series on shame and I don't want  to go through it again, I just want to summarize it. But what we're going to see is complex trauma  causes shame and then shame is really where a lot of the characteristics then come from. They're  the attempt of the person to hide their shame, to compensate for their shame, to feel better about  themselves together, they're all responses to shame which comes out of complex trauma. So,  this shame is just a massive thing. The problem is, is that in our culture it's either not understood  at all, not talked about a concept that's not even recognized as being important or it's misunderstood  by many people. And so, there's the majority of our culture that think they don't have shame.  When the reality is, they're full of shame, they're controlled by shame. Shame is one of the most  powerful negative influences in their life and they're not even aware of it. The common misunderstanding  around shame is that people just think of shame as an emotion and it is an emotion.  So, we hear all the time, you should be ashamed of yourself and so we immediately identify  or I understand the emotion of shame. But what I want you to understand is that emotion of shame  comes out of a deeper element of shame which is it's a core belief about myself. It's a core  belief that I'm not good enough, that something is wrong with me. The next issue for many people is  that shame has been confused with guilt and so they get blended together. Now, what's important  to understand is that shame and guilt overl..."}]}
