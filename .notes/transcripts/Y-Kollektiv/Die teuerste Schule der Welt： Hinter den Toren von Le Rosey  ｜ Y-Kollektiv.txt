In summer at Lake Geneva, in winter in the Swiss mountains. Le Rosé is the most expensive school in the world. More than 160,000 euros a single school year costs here. I want to find out who sends his children here. Who doesn't want the best for his child? I'm a dad myself, I understand that. But this film shows what happens when this wish no longer knows its limits. When money no longer plays a role. And the price scared you somehow or was that a bit for you? Not that it doesn't matter that you just throw money in. I don't think so. Exclusively, I was allowed to look into the school of the global elite, which otherwise keeps its doors closed. My film begins in winter. I'm in Switzerland, in the Alps. More precisely in the tiny town of Gstaad, which I had never heard of before. Gstaad is the ski resort of the super rich. The first thing I see when I drive into the city is the Palace, one of the most expensive hotels in the world. Stars like Madonna, Paris Hilton and Robbie Williams had or have holiday houses here in the place. Lights are flashing everywhere in the city and in the mountains. And the city is full of people. And in the mountains the slopes are being prepared for tomorrow. This is exactly where Le Rosé has had its winter campus since 1916. So there's our hotel now. Spontaneous first impression. Absolutely everything here reminds me more of a ski vacation than of a school lesson. I'm really curious how it will be tomorrow. I have no idea. The next morning. I'm in the city. I'm on my way with Philippe Laurent. He's responsible for the communication here. He will accompany me throughout the entire shooting. Because for my cameraman Christian and me there are rules here. Some students are not allowed to film in any case. Resignations are not allowed to be seen anywhere. For months I wrote back and forth with Philippe until we were allowed to make this film. Only about every ten years a camera team is allowed in here. Finding students who want to talk to me was not easy either. But we found some. I'm meeting Andras. He's just before his 16th birthday and comes from a German entrepreneur family. I can't say more. We've already looked around a bit. Different chalets and where everything is. Of course, with what you normally imagine from school, it's completely different. How many years have you been here? This is my second year here. And I'm in class two here. How was it for you when you first came here? I thought it was brilliant. Of course, with all the beautiful mountains and skiing. And now a little snow. It was very nice. I've noticed one thing. One thing is the same as in any other school. It starts early. How does your start in the morning usually look like? I wake up at 6.30 a.m. And then we go here at 7.30 a.m. Because we have breakfast check-in at 8 a.m. And then at 8.10 a.m. it starts again with school. And then at 12 a.m. we have a lunch break. And then school again. Or skiing. It depends on what day it is. Instead of classroom to classroom, the students have to walk from one chalet to another. The school is divided into several houses, like a small village. A total of 460 students from 71 different countries. Andras' English is on the schedule for the hour. English is super important for you, of course, because you have students from ... Exactly. Your friends come from ... Exactly. My best friend is from Brazil. I have friends from Japan, Mexico, Spain. Really. Really. From all over the world. What would you say is different here from your normal school? I can see that the class is smaller. Exactly. I would say that the classes are much smaller. I think a maximum of 12 students in one class. And that's super awesome. Because then you can talk to the teacher directly without the class being too big. I quickly notice that some things here are different. The class size, definitely the view from the window. But other things are just like with me in the past. There are work sheets and the students have to interpret different book covers. Andras. Yes, I would say it's definitely a more modernized version of the play or the cover. And I think it goes more about social media and I would definitely say highlights humiliation. Almost because you can see in the middle, you have the yellow ... Andras' English is perfect. Almost all students here are. The whole climax is that there's a lot of confusion. So the maze is ... Languages are particularly important in school. They teach more than 30 on a mother tongue level. The learning atmosphere in the class is pleasant. No reporting, no chatting. Everyone is participating. Almost familiar. Right. Enjoy the rest of your day. Thursday is a long day. I hope it's not too tiring, slash boring. Okay. I hope you have a good day. I hope you have a good day. I hope you have a good day. I hope you have a good day. I hope you have a good day. Okay. Good morning, guys. Thank you, sir. Good morning, guys. Thank you, sir. Good morning, guys. Thank you, sir. A special workshop takes place in the late afternoon. The students are supposed to create a clone of themselves with AI and then develop a business plan on how to make money with this clone. They probably don't have very many people that are subscribing, so they have to charge more per subscriber to make the money to offset the cost. But there's no money. I'm not speaking about ... These people that make these apps, they have to try a lot. They have to try a lot. They have to try to live by it. But me, I'm still at this age, I can try to start charging small amounts of money so that more people can afford it. The workshop is given by a father, Chad. He's a tech millionaire from Silicon Valley. He tells the students that he started his first business under the worst circumstances and without money. I'm even more wondering why he's putting his daughter in the picture, now sending her to the most expensive school in the world. He's a Perp student living in California, and she herself wanted to reach out and look at other areas of the world. So he interviewed and talked to schools in the UK, Switzerland, all over the world. And she decided on her own that La Rose was the one she wanted to go to. Watching schools all over the world to then decide for one. These are statements that I notice that the families here have a completely different horizon. Money doesn't matter. Space doesn't matter. I also notice this fact. Chad tells me that in winter, he's going to work here in Gstaad, in the city of Gstaad. And he lives here in Gstaad to be closer to his daughter. Andras' parents do the same. I wonder what that costs. I drive through the place during a break, look online and find no house that's cheaper than about 20,000 euros rent per month or 5 million euros purchase price. I meet Andras again after dinner. He tells me that even if the parents live here, the children live in school during the week. Because La Rose is an boarding school with strict rules. So when do you have to be here and are you here all week or how does it work? Exactly, so I'm here all week except on Saturday evening or Sunday evening, when I can be with my parents on the weekend. So if they have something here. Okay, so your parents live here too? Exactly. But during the week you see them, so that's also funny, your parents are in the same place, but you don't see them during the week? Not really. Sometimes we have a dinner party, so you can have dinner with your parents, but you can only do that twice a week. It depends on how the week goes, whether I have to do homework and then I can't go to dinner. Do you still miss your parents? Or is it less with time? You've been at school for two years now. I imagine, I don't know, you're 16 now, but maybe 14, 15, if I knew my parents were up there, I might have wanted to go there in the evening. I would say that. After time, you get used to it. And I talk to my parents a lot, and that helps too, because you feel like they're there and not completely excluded from the world. To ask permission to have dinner with the parents. It's strange to me. But if you didn't have rules with rich people, it would go down and over at school, says Philippe. Andras has to be in the boarding house at 8 o'clock. At the entrance, the teachers check who arrives when. The teachers also live here. Some, like him, even with their dogs. Checking, guys, please. Thank you. What are you late for? We're trying to convince David to switch rooms with us. Okay. He didn't budge. Oh. Right, then let's go to your room. Andras shows me his room. And whoever, like me, at the most expensive school in the world, is now expecting a fancy single room, is next door. Everyone has a desk. Exactly, desk, chair. Which one is yours? The tidy one or the messy one? You can be honest. The tidy one. Of course. Of course. Like everyone else here, Andras has a double room. And like everyone else here, his day is not over yet. Exactly, we should study until 9.30 and do homework, which makes a lot of sense. Because during the day you don't have that much time to do the different homework. Yes. And then it's 9.30. Then it's party time. Okay. And then we can still be on the phone, call parents, walk into other people's rooms and so on. And then at 10.30 the light is off. Organ, yes. Learning almost 14 hours a day. Only one hour of free time. My prejudices that you are simply spoiled at a private school have been taught a better one today. The next day. Three times a week the students are allowed to ski here after class. Today, even for the whole day. That's the worst part about skiing. Oh yeah. I do get weird looks on the scope. Can we catch this now? Can we do it? Okay. Thank you. Skiing in school. For me it would have been the biggest thing. Philippe has experienced it. Because he used to be a student here himself. How did you like skiing when you came here as a child? It was totally bizarre at first. I mean the concept of two planks of wood on my feet as a Colombian teenager was really strange. I think that there's also a component of you know you have to either practice ski or snowboard, right? So you don't even really think about it so much. It's only now when I look back on that. That I think wow. We used to have classes in the mornings and then go skiing in the afternoons. Who gets to do that? Half of the time they get ski lessons here. Otherwise they are allowed to ski as they want when they are old and old enough. Just like Andras and his friends today. Alright, let's go. We'll just pretend that didn't happen. We'll cut that. When you first looked at the school here and somehow heard that skiing was a part of your winter at school, what was the reason for coming here right away? Of course it was really crazy for me. That I can ski here now during the school. That was really one of the decisive points. Being on the mountain with 460 students from super rich families is a challenge for the teachers. They are also responsible for their safety here. It's about injuries, but also about kidnappings. Every half hour the students have to report to a teacher at a certain place and have them parked. Overall, I notice here again that teachers, but also people like Felipe, have to do much more than just their actual job. They are watchers, helpers, friends. What you really should do is take it from all the way from the ground. Yeah. The TikTok star Felipe, he knows how to do it. The only thing is, you might see my hand in your goggles. That's a cooler angle. Thank you. I like it. Oh my gosh, it's so beautiful. I'm here with Felipe again. I want to learn more about the families here today. Good morning. Good morning. Someone here. Hi, nice to see you again. How was your day? Oh, good, thank you. Felipe also conducts conversations with families who are interested in school. That's why he knows almost every child here, every family, every story. He tells me that many of them come from such rich families that Le Rosé is the only way for them to lead a normal life. What he means by that is, at a normal school they would need, for example, personal protective equipment. That would always be something special. Here they are only one of many. Personal protective equipment, any kind of extra sausage is forbidden here. Of course, without saying any names or something, but who are the families that are sending their children to such a school? I mean, you know, today the school counts with 460 students. I've seen in the press the school being referred to as the school of kings, because there was a time where there was a lot of royalty that would attend the school. That is true. People usually then ask me, is there a lot of royalty today? And I say there's usually a lot less active royalty in the world today than 80 years ago, right? So, sure, in my time I knew some people that were studying here from royal bloodlines, but they weren't necessarily next in line to a throne, right? But you have all kinds. You have movie stars, you have politicians, you have entrepreneurs. You have royalty. I think you can't really single it down to one specific type of family. But I would say potentially more along the lines of what is it that the family values that they have and that they share is probably what brings them together. The days here in Gstaad came to me like in a movie. A school that rather looks like a holiday hotel. Small classes, skiing, teachers and students who seem like friends. It is a very small school. It is a very small school. As if the super rich of the world had created the perfect place for their children here. Like another world. But isn't all of that the case? And isn't it unfair that you can buy such a sacred world for money? I definitely have more than enough questions that I will come back to in summer. Two months later in Roll am Genfersee. This is the summer campus of Le Rosé. The place where the students spend most of the year. In this house everything started in 1880. You can see old initials everywhere in the walls. Today is a special day. Mondays on this campus are always special because we have a school assembly. So all the students and all the teachers come together for the assembly. The assembly takes place in the aula. But I quickly notice that this has nothing to do with an aula like I know it. So this is it. Wow. That is a... Yeah, this is the concert hall. That is a concert hall, right? That's not a typical school assembly hall. That's a real concert hall. Wow. Yeah. I mean the genuine idea was to be able to have a space for classical music. For example, we've had the Berlin Philharmonic has performed here. We've had Phil Collins in concert. The St. Petersburg Philharmonic Orchestra. Mariinsky Orchestra as well has performed here. We've had theater. We've had ballet. When did you build this place and how much did it cost if I may ask? This was inaugurated in October 2014. And it was an investment of around 50 million francs, fully funded by the school. 50 million Swiss francs. In Germany, for 400 students, one would easily build a whole school for this. Today there is no concert here, but as always on Mondays the school assembly. All teachers and students come together and talk about important topics. The school director and owner Christophe Godin opens the event. Hello, teacher. Hello. Let's start. Let's start, Mr. Ticler. And then a project is presented that shows me again that this is not a normal school. So as many of you might know, two years ago we were the first school in mainland Europe to send a satellite up to space. And unfortunately, after 500 and something days, we were the first school in Europe to send a satellite up to space. And unfortunately, after 500 and something days, we were the first school in Europe to send a satellite up to space. We lost connection to it. If you are interested in joining something like this next year, please reply. And then Mr. Ticler will send you the sort of process of signing up, the costs, and what the program will look like. So, thank you very much. Thank you. What I find striking is that when I used to introduce something at my school, they either laughed at me or cheered for me. Everyone listens to you here. No coughing, no laughing, no smartphones. I rather feel like being in a room with 400 little adults and have a feeling of being just like Ticler. to be in a room than with 400 children and adolescents. After the meeting, Philippe and I go on a tour through the school. In the afternoon, everyone has to choose several activities. This is how the students should develop their personality and maybe also find out what they want to do professionally. You need to just describe in words what this app is trying to do. Here the students build their own rover. Design, construction, programming. A crash course in the engineering world, so to speak. So we've worked on this for maybe like over nine months. I've maybe broken it 50 times by now. But it's a really fun experience. The only way you learn is by doing it again and again. Yeah. Otherwise you won't actually learn it. I still feel like you guys have a lot of work left because I mean, I just learned you have four weeks to build a full rover. And I mean, that's impressive, but not a rover yet. But... Can it do something? Can this move now? We're in the testing phase right now. I mean, we could. Yeah. Yeah. Show us how it works. Can it do something? Let's try. That's been the motor class. He's been one of the best students at blowing up things. But like that's... No, no, no. It's funny. No, no, no. Guys, it's funny, but that's the point. That's how you learn. Yes, it's good because that's how you learn. You learn by breaking things. Yeah, this should be the first time we're testing it. It's rather camera. We got it working. Good job. It moves. It moves. Those pads. Try to realize how the camera's moving and put it along with the elements. It'sica's understanding the идеx. So that's how it's going to work. Looks maybe not as global, I just king of funny as I am, but anyway... Tha's the control panel bathroom. The가� headers should be up. So I made up my mind, it must come to an end. Next door we stumble into a group of students who are programming a robot for a world championship. Here, too, I notice again that everyone is having fun, everyone is working, motivated and concentrated, even without a teacher. In my case, group work used to be called nothing to do. But it's different here. Maybe also because everything the students do here from morning to evening is evaluated. All these things will determine what study group they are in. And based on the study group, they have more or less privileges as well. What kind of privileges? So, for example, a privilege for the students in the highest study group is that they can take a day off during the term. But also things like being able to choose your room. Everyone can choose the roommate, but to specifically choose a room, that's a privilege reserved for the students in the highest study group. To promote, but also to demand. That's the principle here. It's becoming clearer to me. As a teenager, I think it would have been too strict for me. But maybe that's why it would have been good for me. I haven't even finished thinking about it yet. The next program point is already on the line. The principle points out, for example, to the class physique in which an instructor has to assign a mile. Every student here is given a mile. And in the center, a minimum of 21 minutes. For this purpose won't seem to change. After All, the also will be allowed to be walking, in the Tails of your classroom. Everything is here. This is associated with what the students say, they often say, listen. How about you? What do you draw constantly? Interesting. All right, I know that. which has nothing to do with school or with the school life. Well, it's always connected to school, maybe a few hours a week, but then at some point you get used to it again and then it's not that bad. You can have some free time on the weekends. Do you still have normal youth here or is it a bit more difficult? So are there parties here or are parties forbidden? Well, it depends on what kind of parties. Of course, there is music here, too. We often have DJs here and sometimes you can go there on the weekends. It's also fun when you meet friends. I learned that you have to wear a suit when eating dinner. Exactly, everyone has to wear a shirt and tie. Why? Philippe, why? It's a tradition. It's a tradition. Alright. And I know at least for my friends and my friends, my brother, when they were here, everyone would hate it. I wouldn't complain about it. Yeah, you hated it? I didn't. Okay, of course not. I learned how to tie my first tie when I got my acceptance letter to come to Rosé. I didn't know how to tie one. I still don't know how to tie a tie, honestly. I had friends doing it at my wedding. So how are you going to do it? I can't do it. But you have to do it. No, I already have it. Oh, you don't have it. I just do it. But when it opens, you're fired. Yes, but I have several jackets. It's okay. You've played through the system. Or are you going to show him how to do it? He cheated the system. Clearly too late. Yeah. It's time for dinner. Girls and boys separated. And again I have the feeling to be with adults on a business trip rather than with teenagers in a school. That's what it said. I was going to say great presentation today. You managed to repeat everything correctly. You're a genius. Just like Ron said. I don't know why Miss Gavin and I are both doing the same thing. I don't know what I was meant to do. But I'm the captain of the... David, get a bit into the water. Really? I'm leading the program. Really? Instead of talking about football, the students are talking about their class. Of course, they know they are being filmed, that the press speaker is standing somewhere here, that their parents might see this. But we filmed the whole dinner. At some point they had forgotten the camera. But apart from a few boys' jokes at the beginning... So how many millions of dollars did you make? Did you make the... Actually, shut up Peter. I'm gonna be kidding. It was like, I can't say it any other way, on a business trip with strict rules. Gentlemen, good evening. Non-traveling on perpetual. Nobody is allowed to get up before the bell, nobody is allowed to eat after the bell. Life here is really strict. And you have to make that clear again. Most people here would probably never work from a financial point of view. They could just have a chill youth in their parents' house. Instead, they give themselves this. I wonder why. What do you think makes it work for you? And why do you see it, as I understand it, as an advantage in the long run? What is your thought behind it? I think it builds a certain character and you just don't get older because of this phase that you are a child. Then stop. You're a man, I would say. Why is it like that, do you think? So why do you already have such a plan in your head? Is it simply because your parents have foreseen it, because you saw it and you want to do it like that, or... I don't know, because it's expected of you? So why do you already think so far? You could just chill and say, yes, my God, I'm not even 18 yet, I don't have to work yet. My God, I still have a little time to live in the day. So of course my parents want that too. But I myself want to have it too. I like it that I start early and then... Okay. I think I'm better prepared for life later on. Not that I'm just wow, that it's just a shock, that I've already got used to it. In my research, I came across a term from sociology at some point. Status-preservation motif. He says the more you have, the more you want the next generation to be at least as good as you. The wish is both for the parents and the children. It is what drives the families here. The next one. My last day in Le Rosé. Today I want to look at another topic, which I have rather made a bow about so far. Money. I meet Maria. She comes from a wealthy Swiss family. I can't say more here either. It is clear that everyone here comes from rich parents' homes. But unlike I thought, it's not like you see it all the time. That, like here, Chanel and Balenciaga bags are lying around and jewelry for thousands of euros is not a problem. The money here is rather invisible, of course. And yet I can't get it out of my head that the parents here pay more money for each single child than I, than most households in Germany, even earn. Let's compare. In Germany, a school has about 9,000 euros per year per student without boarding school. Here it is more than 160,000. And in Germany, the average school is about 1,000,000 euros. And in Germany, the average school is about 1,000,000 euros. And in Germany, the average school is about 1,000,000 euros. Maria shows me the art space of the school. And I ask myself whether she is actually aware of her privileges. Not that I have any toplistic privilege at all, of course. I look at it differently. The university is for all populations of people with disabilities. It is about achieving the goals and it's about acknowledging that there are people you trust at some level that make a difference. It's about negotiating opportunities. studios. But yes, it's true. I have been pressured in trying to exceed a lot of the expectations, but that is something that you also get to, like you learn to cope with later on throughout your education. The longer I am here, the more I look and ask, the more I see that there is a lot of pressure behind the facade. Even if the students, so I think, always try not to say it so directly. I meet Andrasch one last time again and I am still always concerned about what he said yesterday evening. What your seted in your life kind of purpose, so what kind of work that you like? Hard question I would say, but actually, later on, I have finished my Whole Life training. Ultimately, I want to be a leader-thinking man. So there will observe just like I do in Germany. I hope and believe that I'll have a competitive ihrth in Germany where I might fail to foolishly dance right. understand or don't know yet how I can deal with the idea or something like that. It is clear to you that later in your career you also want to have a leadership position or responsibility, because even if you do a leadership program, you already do it with ambition and not just, I'll just go to school and see where my path leads me and somehow go into the business. You already have high goals for yourself in your life, right? Yes, I would say that too. Here I also take responsibility for smaller things, but I also want to continue doing that later in life. Where does that come from? Do you think that's the case for you too? Does the school do that, but maybe it does that for the parents' house, because your parents have done a lot of work and are successful? Where do you think that comes from? I think both of them, of course my parents, but also the school. They want us to be successful and that we have strong character and that we continue to have that kind of life. That's what I think. And the price scared you somehow or was it actually a bit of education for you, this value for us and we can afford it and that's okay? Not that it doesn't matter that you just throw money because I don't think so, but that it is worth it because you can really use the things here, that it is in the long term, I think that it is totally worth it. Long term. That's what Andras says, I think, is an important word. The families here don't want to leave the lives of their children to chance. They want, as far as possible, to plan a professionally successful future. They see education as an investment. The school is also investing. In the future, there should be another 100 more students here, because demand is rising. There are about five applications on every free space in Le Rosé. So that's the entrance. This will be the main entrance. This will be the main entrance. This is the entrance. This will be the main entrance. This is the main entrance. It is. That's the main entrance. That's what Christophe Goudin tells me. He owns the school and he leads it in second generation. Innovative start-ups will also have their company seat in the new building. The students can then do internships there and gain early practical experience in the economy. My time here in Le Rosé is over. And honestly, I worked for children's television for 13 years and shot at really many schools. Nothing is comparable in terms of approach to what I did here. If you want to be sure that something will come of your own child, there may not be a better place in the world than this one. But of course only for a tiny part of society. And that's exactly what makes me think. It's a great space to learn, maybe the best one. But also, of course, for a very small privileged group. Like, would you, do you think that if you want to do something here, you have to start with the parents? Because if you have to start with the parents, you have to start with the parents. And the parents have to have a lot of children to do it. And I think it's a great opportunity. There's nothing better than this. Would you, do you think about that sometimes? And would you wish that like on a broader scale for even more students, education would look a little bit more like it looks here? I think we do think about it. And there's really two answers we give. The first is we do try to go and help a number of other projects. So we have a school in Mali, for instance, in Bamako. There's also a school in Athens where we've been very involved for years. The second aspect is obviously we want to make sure that Rosians learn that everything they're learning here is a privilege and they share it beyond. And we have, if you look at alumni, sadly we don't share the names, but there's a number that have had a very powerful impact in the world in big part because of what they learned in this school. And we've got to be very careful not to blame our parents or our schools for that. I don't think so either. As a dad, I believe that in doubt, one is always more in favour of the best for one's child rather than the best for society. In the small world, most of us probably do that. And when families who have so much money that it doesn't matter anymore to do that with the issue of education, then this place comes out here. For me, he shows at the end, if driven to the top, above all, that the opportunities in life are already super early, than we often think in everyday life.
