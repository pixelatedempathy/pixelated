**Potential Impacts/Next Steps (if any):**

- The next step is to refine `performBroadClassification` as per the subsequent task in `mentalllama-integration.mdx`, which includes adding 'crisis' as a possible `targetAnalyzer`, implementing `LLM_CATEGORY_TO_ANALYZER_MAP` more robustly (already partially done), and improving sanitization and default logic.
- Further integration of the `MentalHealthTaskRouter` into the `MentalLLaMAAdapter` is also pending.

**Security Considerations Addressed:**

- The LLM call is made through an existing `llmInvoker`, assumed to handle its own security (e.g., API keys, HTTPS).
- Input to the LLM (`text`) via `buildRoutingPromptMessages` is not directly from an external user without prior sanitization layers (assumed to be handled before reaching this router).
- JSON parsing includes a basic sanitization step (`.replace(/```json/g, '').replace(/```/g, '').trim()`) to handle common LLM output variations before parsing, reducing risks from malformed JSON.
- Error handling prevents leaking sensitive details; specific error types (`LLMInvocationError`, `ClassificationParseError`) are used.

**Pre-existing Issues Noted:**

- None noted during this specific task.

**Linter Status:**

- No new linter errors were introduced by these changes. Code adheres to project linting and clean code standards.

- Logging: Adheres to structured logging practices with awareness of PII.
- Dependencies: Assumes secure communication with the MentalLLaMA provider and prompt system.
- Output Data: The analyzer handles sensitive personal wellness information, which must be managed securely by all consuming systems.

**(If applicable) Pre-existing Issues Noted:**

- None noted during the implementation of this specific task.

**(If applicable) Linter Status:**

- The generated code aligns with standard TypeScript and clean code conventions. A final check with the project-specific linter configuration is recommended. No new linter errors are anticipated from the code's structure.

## AI Task Update - 2025-05-18

**Task Completed:** Performance optimization for `analyzeEmotions` (Phase 1: Enhanced Analytics). - Specifically: Optimized `analyzeEmotions` in `EmotionLlamaProvider` for empty/whitespace inputs.

**Summary of Changes:**

- Modified `src/lib/ai/providers/EmotionLlamaProvider.ts`.
- Added a guard clause at the beginning of the `analyzeEmotions` method.
- If the input `text` is empty or consists only of whitespace, the method now immediately returns a default `EmotionAnalysis` object.
- This change prevents unnecessary processing, FHE encryption (if applicable), and external API calls for trivial inputs, contributing to performance optimization and resource saving.

**Files Modified:**

- `src/lib/ai/providers/EmotionLlamaProvider.ts`

**UI/UX Impact (if applicable):**

- No direct UI change.
- Indirectly contributes to a smoother experience by potentially speeding up operations that call `analyzeEmotions` with empty inputs.

**Potential Impacts/Next Steps (if any):**

- The broader "Performance optimization" task for Phase 1 remains open. Further profiling and optimization of other aspects of `analyzeEmotions` or other analytics features can be undertaken.
- Consider defining clear performance benchmarks for analytics features.

**Security Considerations Addressed:**

- The change itself is low-risk. It handles an edge case (empty input) and doesn't alter existing security mechanisms like FHE, which remain governed by options.
- By avoiding processing for empty strings, it marginally reduces attack surface for any vulnerabilities that might exist in later stages of processing for such inputs (though none were identified).

**Pre-existing Issues Noted:**

- None noted during this specific task.

**Linter Status:**

- The change is minor and syntactically simple; it is expected to introduce no new linter errors.

## AI Task Update - 2025-05-19

**Task Completed:** Treatment Planning Component - Backend & Supabase Integration (Part of Documentation Automation).

**Summary of Changes:**

- **Supabase Migration:** Created a new migration file (`supabase/migrations/20250519120000_create_treatment_plan_tables.sql`) to define schemas for `treatment_plans`, `treatment_goals`, and `treatment_objectives`. Includes tables, ENUM types for status fields, foreign key relationships with cascade deletes, an `updated_at` auto-update trigger, RLS policies (users manage their own data), and indexes.
- **API Refactoring:** Refactored the Treatment Plan API routes (`src/pages/api/treatment-plans/index.ts` and `src/pages/api/treatment-plans/[planId].ts`) to use Supabase instead of an in-memory store.
  - Integrated user authentication via `Astro.locals.supabase` to ensure users can only access and modify their own treatment plans.
  - GET endpoints now fetch plans and their nested goals/objectives from Supabase for the authenticated user.
  - POST endpoint now inserts new plans, goals, and objectives into Supabase tables, associating them with the authenticated user. Noted that DB RPCs are recommended for atomicity here.
  - PUT endpoint updates plans, goals, and objectives in Supabase. Also noted that DB RPCs are highly recommended for complex nested updates/deletes/inserts.
  - DELETE endpoint removes plans from Supabase for the authenticated user (cascades to goals/objectives).
  - Zod schemas updated to align with Supabase data types (e.g., UUIDs for IDs) and server-side handling of `user_id`.
- **Type Definitions:** `src/types/treatment.ts` remains the source for TypeScript interfaces, guiding the API and database structure.
- **UI Component (`TreatmentPlanManager.tsx`):** No changes in this step, but it is now backed by a persistent Supabase datastore via the updated APIs. The next step for UI would be to implement the detailed forms for create/edit.

**Files Modified:**

- **Created:** `supabase/migrations/20250519120000_create_treatment_plan_tables.sql`
- **Updated:** `src/pages/api/treatment-plans/index.ts`
- **Updated:** `src/pages/api/treatment-plans/[planId].ts`
- **Updated:** `.notes/in-progress/ai-features-roadmap.mdx` (progress to 85% for Documentation Automation)

**UI/UX Impact (if applicable):**

- No direct UI changes in this step.
- Significantly improves data persistence and reliability for the Treatment Plan Management feature, which is foundational for future UI enhancements.
- Ensures that treatment plans are user-specific and secure.

**Potential Impacts/Next Steps (if any):**

- The Supabase migration needs to be run against the development/production database.
- Further development of the `TreatmentPlanManager.tsx` UI component is needed to implement the forms for creating and editing treatment plans with their nested goals and objectives.
- For robust create/update operations of nested structures, Supabase Database Functions (RPC) should be implemented as noted in the API route comments to ensure atomicity.
- Thorough testing of API endpoints with various user scenarios and RLS policies.

**Security Considerations Addressed:**

- **Data Persistence:** Moved from a volatile in-memory store to a persistent Supabase database.
- **Authentication & Authorization:** API endpoints now verify user authentication using Supabase Auth and are designed to work with the RLS policies defined in the migration, ensuring users can only access/modify their own data.
- **Input Validation:** Zod validation remains in place for all API inputs.
- **Database Security:** RLS policies are applied directly at the database level. Foreign keys ensure relational integrity.

**Pre-existing Issues Noted:**

- None noted during this specific task.

**Linter Status:**

- Changes to API routes and the new SQL migration file are expected to introduce no new linter errors. Code adheres to TypeScript and SQL best practices.

## Task Completed: Treatment outcome forecasting

**Summary of Changes:**

- Implemented a secure, production-grade API route (`src/pages/api/analytics/treatment-forecast.ts`) for treatment outcome forecasting using the OutcomeRecommendationEngine and ContextualAwarenessService.
- Developed a modern Astro UI page (`src/pages/analytics/treatment-forecast.astro`) with a form for input, robust error handling, and results visualization using ChartWidget.

**Files Modified:**

- src/pages/api/analytics/treatment-forecast.ts
- src/pages/analytics/treatment-forecast.astro
- .notes/in-progress/ai-features-roadmap.mdx
- .notes/status.mdx (this update)

**UI/UX Impact:**

- Adds a visually appealing, accessible analytics page for clinicians to forecast treatment outcomes, supporting clinical decision-making with clear charts and rationales.

**Potential Impacts/Next Steps:**

- Enables further integration with documentation automation and progress note generation.
- Next: Implement challenge prediction algorithms and comparative progress analysis.

**Security Considerations Addressed:**

- All input is validated and sanitized (zod schemas).
- No sensitive data is exposed in logs or responses.
- Output is encoded and error handling is robust.

**Linter Status:**

- No new linter errors introduced for the new files. Existing linter errors in unrelated files remain.
