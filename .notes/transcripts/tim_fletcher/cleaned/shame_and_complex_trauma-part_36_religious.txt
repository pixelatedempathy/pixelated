You should be down on yourself.  If things are going well, you will sabotage the good stuff in your life and make it all fall apart.  That's punishing yourself.  Or if things are going well, you can start flirting with risky people and risky behavior.  You are not fully sabotaging, but you are playing with sabotaging.  And if something bad happens, oh well.  And away you go.  That can be a thing.  Negative thought loops that play in your head.  All the time putting yourself down, telling yourself you are useless, a failure, never amount to anything, nobody will want you.  All of that.  Then if you fail, you have this thing called a sense of justice.  And a sense of justice kicks in and says, you failed, you deserve to be punished.  And I am not going to let you out of the doghouse, which is where you are going, until you have served your time.  So I ask clients all the time, when you fail, do you put yourself in the doghouse?  And they all go, yes.  I go, how long do you have to stay in the doghouse before you will let yourself out?  Before you will treat yourself nicely again?  Some will go two weeks, some will say, or two days, some will say a week.  That's how much I want to be punished.  That's how much I got to punish myself before I think justice has been served.  So shame taps into that justice system.  And it says, because I feel like I failed, or I feel like a failure, I need to punish myself all the time.  Because I feel like a failure all the time, therefore punishment all the time.  And one of the things that many people do is just focus on their negative thoughts.  One of the things that many people do is just focus on their negative thoughts.  And they do not look at their good qualities, they do not look at accomplishments, they are just always finding fault with themselves.  Okay, two more things, very quickly.  Shame, I think, is one of the biggest things to affect mental health today.  And I think the mental health world is gradually starting to realize it.  And what I have done is on the very left is complex trauma, and it's a spectrum from very severe trauma to mild trauma.  Okay, next to that are all the mental health issues that come out.  So the greater the trauma, the greater the shame.  So if somebody neglected you, your shame might not be as bad as somebody who was abandoned, or who was sexually abused, or severely physically abused.  They are going to feel even worse that it's their fault, that they have no value.  Next to that, they are going to have more anger issues.  Next to that, they are going to have more depression issues.  The greater their trauma, the greater their shame.  So if you have tons of shame, you are going to have tons of depression because you do not like your life.  It sucks.  And then you are going to have greater anxiety issues.  What do people think of me?  Is anybody going to love me?  All of that comes out of tons of shame.  And then I put up other mental health disorders that come out of shame.  So as shame gets greater, your brain has to deny it more to survive.  So what happens when a person gets to NPD, or narcissistic personality disorder?  They deny that they have any shame.  That's the only way to survive.  That's the only way to survive.  That's the only way they can survive.  And the truth is they have more shame than others.

But they have to deny it and act superior to others to survive.  When you get to a psychopath or a social path, they have got the most shame of anybody in the world.

But they are totally shut down about that.  So the greater the shame, the greater the mental health problems.  And that's because the brain has to do greater and greater things that are bizarre to try and survive with that much shame.  And then the final result, and this is important to understand, is do you realize the more shame you have, the more people can manipulate you?  Do you realize that your mom might be able to manipulate you to do whatever you want, she wants you to do, but if you had zero shame, your mom could not manipulate you at all?  If you had zero shame, your mom could not manipulate you at all?  It's your shame that makes you vulnerable to being manipulated.  So just think about that.  When mom wants to get you to do what you want and you said no, and she wants you to get you to change your no to a yes, what does she do?  She lays a guilt trip on you.  After all I have done for you and all you have put me through, After all I have done for you and all you have put me through, I cannot sleep at night because I worry so much about you.  You are really messing with my life here and all of a sudden you are feeling so crappy.  Okay, mom, okay.  So she begins to play on your shame.  Or she withholds love from you.  She gives you the silent treatment.  And you do not like that.  That makes you feel all messed up inside and she makes you sit in it for a while.  That makes you feel all messed up inside and she makes you sit in it for a while.  And then you come begging, Okay, mom, I will do whatever you want.  Just love me.  Your shame she has just played on.  Or she gives you distorted logic that triggers shame stuff.  I am your parent.  You should respect me.  And we have talked about that.

But if you have got lots of shame, that will really bother you.  She will throw your past in your face to trigger shame.  So if you want to stop giving your mom or your ex so much power in your life and take away their ability to manipulate you, deal with your shame.  Because if you do not, you are a puppet that they know how to pull the strings.  So I get asked all the time, What's the big deal about shame?  Why do we need to talk about shame so much?  Are you starting to see it's a big deal?  Are you starting to see that, Wow, if I do not deal with this stuff, I am setting myself up for nothing but trouble in life and relationship.  In this Christian part of our night, what I have been doing is trying to go to Bible stories that speak to the shame issue.  And what many people with shame, without even realizing it, deep down believe, is that we are not going to be able to do anything about it.  We are going to be able to do it.  And what many people deep down believe is they know academically that God loves them, but deep down they are not convinced He really wants them.  So there's an emotional resistance.  There might be an intellectual acceptance, but there's something that just has trouble believing that God would love somebody like me.  So I have been looking or presenting stories that speak to that fear, that distorted belief, which is really a lie, that will help us with that.  And tonight I want to tell you the story of a lady named Rahab.  Rahab was the first real prostitute that we meet in the Bible.  And I want to say this right up front just to kind of help you understand where I am coming from.  I have dealt with hundreds and hundreds of women and men who have sold their bodies, often just to get drugs, often because they were forced to and pimped out, or they were taken and trafficked, all of those things.

But what I have found in dealing with pretty well everybody that I know that has been in selling their body is there is a trauma element in their childhood.  And so part of what they have done in their way of coping has led them down a trail that has resulted in the sale of their body for sex.  I would suspect, and I cannot say it for sure, but I would suspect that Rahab, who was a prostitute, renowned prostitute, and I will explain why in a minute, had a lot of childhood trauma.  And that was part of her journey, and what that means is there was an element of shame.  The second thing that I want you to think about, and I say this very carefully, but when people are involved in the sale, the sale of their body, there has to be something that shuts off in order to endure the added shame they feel for what they lower themselves to do.  And so some of them are in total denial of that layer of shame, but when you get to know them and they feel safe, and they become more self-aware, they begin to be able to talk about the shame that grew during their time of being involved in prostitution.  So shame is a common and a deep issue with those who have been involved in prostitution.  One of the things that's interesting about Rahab, if you know the story, Rahab lived in Jericho.  So when Israel came out of Egypt, out of slavery, they went across the wilderness, they got to the edge and they said, we cannot go in, so God made them wander around in the wilderness for 40 years until that generation died out.  The next generation under Joshua comes again to the edge of the promised land, to the Jordan River, and they go across.  The first city that they come to is Jericho.  So Jericho was the first place they entered in this new land of promise.  It was a fortified city.  It was a city that was prepared for war.  It was a city that we are told the walls were so thick that they could drive chariots around on the top of the walls.  So that's how fortified it was.  What we know about Rahab is she had a house in the walls.  So another way to say that is only the very wealthy could afford houses in the walls.  Other people lived inside the walls, in their homes, shacks, whatever, but the well-to-do had houses in the walls.  So Rahab was well-to-do.  I do not know if you remember this story, but her signal that she was a prostitute was she hung a red cord out of her window.  So everybody walking by could look up and go, just like being in Holland in the red light district, oh, there's the prostitute.  There's who we go to see.  So she had the first advantage for advertising her wares because she was in the wall, and she could put a scarlet cord or rope hanging out of her window.  So she was a prominent, powerful, renowned prostitute who was busier and more respected than other prostitutes.  So that's a little bit about Rahab.  So what is going to happen is when they come to the Promised Land, before they cross the river to go across, they send two spies to check out Jericho to get a report of what to expect.  Okay?  Those two spies go to Rahab's house.

Now, I will explain that in just a minute, but let me read you the story.  So Joshua secretly sent out two spies.  He instructed them, scout out the land on the other side of the Jordan, especially around Jericho.  So the two men set out and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there that night.  Someone told the king of Jericho, some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land.  So the king sent orders to Rahab, bring out the men who have come into your house, for they have come here to spy out the whole land.  Rahab had hidden the two men, but she replied, yes, the men were here earlier, but I do not know where they are from.  They left town as the gates were about to close.  I do not know where they went.  A bold-faced lie.  Actually, she had hidden them on the roof, beneath bundles of flax.  Before the spies went to sleep that night, Rahab went up on the roof, not to give them sex, but to talk with them.  And here's what she says.  I know the Lord has given you this land.  In other words, I know you are going to win.  We are all afraid of you.  Everyone in the land is living in terror.  We have heard how your God made a dry path for you through the Red Sea when you left Egypt.  We know that you do not know what you did to the Amorite kings east of Jordan, whose people you completely destroyed.  In other words, you defeated armies much greater than you.  No wonder our hearts have melted in fear.  No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things, for your God is a supreme God.  Would not that be a great report for two spies to take back?  Now let me get you to kind of go into the spies in Joshua's mind.  He's sending the spies to scout out the land, but he wants to find a place where you can get information.  Where would a guy go if they are visiting this city of Jericho and you are a traveling salesperson, a traveling businessman?  Where do they tend to go?  To prostitutes.  And what do they do when they are with prostitutes?  They talked.  The only time guys talk.  And they start talking.  And they are starting to share all kinds of different stories.  So if you want to find out what's going on in a country and a city, who is the best person to talk to?  A prostitute.  One who would get more traffic than anybody else.  So that is Joshua's logic.  Where do I go to find out what the people are thinking and feeling?  Let's find a prominent prostitute.  Oh look, hanging out of that window in the land.  And on the wall is a scarlet rope.  Let's go there boys and find out from her what's going on.  So that was the thing.  Now what is very interesting, and this is the part I want you to really kind of think deeper with me about.  After they conquered, so after this visit, Rahab said, you are going to defeat us.  Please let your God save me.  And the spy said to her, our God will save you if you hang out your rope when we start walking around the city.  And when the city falls, your place will not crumble and fall if that rope is hanging out of the window.  She believed them.  She kept the rope out.  They went around the city the seven times.  If you remember the seven days, the seven times on the last day, they blew a trumpet and the wall started falling down.  All except the wall where Rahab's house was.  She was spared because she believed in Israel's God.  The result of that is she went and lived with the Israelites.  She became a member of their community.  She married that somebody within that community.  Okay, so I want you to begin to think with me about all of that.  So the first thing that is apparent to me is this.  This lady, when she talked to the spies, she talked about Israel God and the stories that she had heard since she was a little girl about Israel's God.  So to be a prostitute, she had to be 30 to 40.  Israel's been wandering around the desert for 40 years.  So she was not even born when Israel came out of slavery in Egypt.  Okay, so all the stories she's heard as a little girl.  She's heard as she's grown up.  She's heard people.  And what you see is even though nobody was encouraging her towards the true God, something was growing in her heart.  Something was planting a seed there.  And what I have seen is people who have had no connection to Christianity, people have been raised in horrific abuse.  Some of them have had a seed planted by one person at a young age about God and it started to bear fruit.  And they thought about it.  They thought about it as they have grown up.  So she has started to believe.  Now she has come to a place where she says, this God is going to win.  I will protect these spies knowing that if she got caught, she could be put to death for treason.  So her faith was at such a point that she says, I am so convinced this God is going to win.  He will protect me.  He will protect my life to protect these spies.  So that was the level of her faith.  Then she comes into the community.  Do you think she might have felt out of place?  Do you think she walked around feeling everybody was staring at her because they knew her former occupation?  Do you think there might have been days where some horny man would come up to her and say, are you still in business?  And how awkward she would have felt with all of that?  Do you think others would have walked by her with the nose in the air and given her that disgusting, you are nobody, we know who you are, and they judged her?  Do you think she might have had times where she was tempted to go back to that way of life and get the attention and easy money that it gave her?  Probably all of the above.  So for her to come into Israel was not as simple as saying, come into this place and know how much I love you.  It was coming into a place where her shame was going to start to come up.  And there was going to be all kinds of things that would come up with that shame.  And then I think deep down, she might have questioned at times, okay, all these people say God loves me, but does he really?  After all I have done my whole life, after the stuff I have done to other people, I have done nothing but to love God.  And she was like, I am not going to love God.  I will do anything.  I will do anything for the sake of God.  I will do anything for the sake of God.  I will do anything for the sake of God.  I will do anything for the sake of God.  And this is what God does.

And so, what I have done to other people, I am not sure God could ever forgive me.  And I am not sure God would make me into something special and want to use me in any special way.  Maybe he will give me a job picking up dog poop or something like that and make me feel I got some importance, Jesus genealogy.  Matthew 1, it says, Salmon was the father of Boaz, who was the mother of Rahab.  So Boaz was the father of Obed, whose mother was Ruth.  Obed was the father of Jesse, Jesus.  Jesse was the father of King David.  So guess what King David's great-great-grandma was?  Rahab.  And who came from David?  Jesus.  So guess who Jesus had in his distant ancestry?  Oh, that prostitute.  Did God want to use a prostitute?  You bet.  Did he want to give her a little job or a big job?  He said, I am going to give you some very significant people as part of your ancestry who are going to change the world.  1.  You are going to get to meet a little guy named David.  He's going to change the world.  And you are going to have a role in his life.  I am going to trust you with that.  And then I am going to let you have the privilege of being the great-great-great-great-great many, many times grandmother of Jesus the Messiah.  What that story shows us is that God specializes in using messed-up people.  He does not look down on them.  He does not give them the little account jobs.  He gives them some of the greatest jobs.  If you go back through history and you look at the people that made the greatest changes in history, positive changes, most of them came out of severe brokenness.  Moses came out of severe brokenness.  David came out of severe brokenness.  All of them, were used greatly by God.  And so it's like God says, I will forgive.

But more than that, I am not going to use the past against them.

I want to give them a privilege, position, and blessings.  And I am going to take all of that pain and the work it takes to overcome that pain to build into them a character and a giftedness and a skill set that nobody else could ever have.  Unless they went through that.  And that's the skill set I am going to need to change the world.  And so as you look at your brokenness and your shame, and you might feel like Rahab did when she first came into Israel, and you might wonder if God could ever love you or even think of using you.  Go back to Rahab.  And what's fascinating to me is this in the genealogy of Jesus, it mentions four women.  And that's all.

But other women THAT are not Eren.  In a great way.  With burlesquare Until graham, was clothed mostblack to get the color I see.  He wants us and has plans for us and wants to.
