# Current Context - Updated December 2025

## Recent Major Developments

### Integrated Training Pipeline Implementation
The project has successfully implemented a comprehensive 6-stage integrated training pipeline that combines multiple data sources into a unified training dataset. This represents a major advancement from the previous 4-stage architecture.

### Key New Components Discovered
1. **Edge & Voice Ingestion System** - Complete integration of Stage 3 (edge stress test) and Stage 4 (voice/persona) data flows
2. **150+ Specialized Training Processors** - Advanced quality assessment, therapeutic accuracy, voice optimization, and crisis intervention processors
3. **MCP Integration Architecture** - 13 task types for AI agent interactions with real-time progress tracking
4. **Comprehensive API Framework** - 15+ REST endpoints with FastAPI implementation
5. **Advanced Safety Systems** - Crisis detection alerts, nightmare fuel scenario success rates, and therapeutic appropriateness validation

### Current Training Data Distribution
- **Stage 1 Foundation**: 40% - Baseline therapeutic tone, reflective listening
- **Stage 2 Expertise**: 25% - Structured reasoning, diagnosis scaffolding  
- **Stage 3 Edge Cases**: 20% - 25 nightmare fuel categories with guard rails off
- **Stage 4 Voice/Persona**: 15% - Tim Fletcher tone, personality consistency

### Performance Metrics Enhancement
- **Crisis Response Accuracy** tracking added to training metrics
- **Empathy Score Tracking** for therapeutic technique improvement
- **Voice Processing Efficiency** monitoring for audio-based training
- **Multi-GPU Coordination** for enhanced training throughput

## Current Work Focus
The platform is now focused on production deployment optimization with enhanced monitoring, bias detection across expanded datasets, and integration of Google Drive's 600+ additional training instances for comprehensive competency development.

### Psychology Books & Sarcasm Detection Integration
**Psychology Textbook Corpus**: The **xmu_psych_books** dataset has been successfully integrated into Tier 6 knowledge loader, providing comprehensive psychology knowledge base with 10K+ entries. This includes foundational therapeutic knowledge, DSM-5 reference materials, and psychology textbook content for validation and training enhancement.

**Sarcasm Detection Capabilities**: Advanced personality analysis system includes **sarcasm recognition capabilities** through the PersonalityAdapter system. The system can detect sarcasm in therapeutic conversations and adapt communication styles accordingly, with specific handling for:
- Sarcasm as anger expression in trauma contexts
- Personality-based communication style adaptation
- Therapeutic approach customization based on sarcasm patterns

**Big Five Personality Adaptation**: The PersonalityAdapter system provides sophisticated personality analysis with:
- Communication style matching (Direct, Supportive, Analytical, Empathetic)
- Therapeutic approach selection (CBT, DBT, Humanistic, Psychodynamic)
- Conversation pace and detail level optimization
- Emotional support level calibration

## Next Steps
1. Update memory bank documentation with new findings
2. Optimize training infrastructure performance
3. Enhance monitoring and analytics capabilities
4. Implement Google Drive dataset integration
5. Scale deployment for global institutional adoption
6. **Enhance psychology book utilization** with advanced knowledge extraction
7. **Expand sarcasm detection training** with real-world conversation analysis
8. **Integrate personality-based therapeutic approaches** across all training modules
