# Framework 2: Cialdini (6 Persuasion Principles)

## The 6 Universal Principles

1. **Reciprocity**: People feel obligated to return favors
   - Strategy: Offer free value first (trial, consultation, report)
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

2. **Commitment & Consistency**: People want to appear consistent with past actions
   - Strategy: Get small initial commitment → expand
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

3. **Social Proof**: People follow what others (especially peers) are doing
   - Strategy: Show competitor adoption, case studies, testimonials
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

4. **Liking**: People say yes to those they like
   - Strategy: Build rapport, find commonality, genuine compliments
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

5. **Authority**: People defer to credible experts
   - Strategy: Credentials, third-party endorsements, expert opinions
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

6. **Scarcity**: People want what's limited or exclusive
   - Strategy: Limited time offers, exclusive access, FOMO
   - Effectiveness: Rate 0-100%

## Analysis Process

For each principle, assess:
- Baseline susceptibility (0-100%)
- Evidence from research (citations)
- Tactical application (how to leverage)
