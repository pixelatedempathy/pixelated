- [ ] Ensure PHI/PII handling conforms to HIPAA and regional regulations; implement masking/encryption as needed
- [ ] Implement an approval workflow for publishing datasets and model artifacts (approver roles + audit logs)
- [ ] Add automated checks for license compliance on third-party datasets and code dependencies
- [ ] Conduct penetration testing and threat modelling for pipeline endpoints
- [ ] Prepare compliance artifacts for external auditors (logs, policies, runbooks)
- [ ] Implement a data retention and deletion policy with tooling to enforce it
- [ ] Add contractual & legal review checklist for public release
- [ ] Produce the release checklist (versioning, changelog, roll-back plan, notification plan)
