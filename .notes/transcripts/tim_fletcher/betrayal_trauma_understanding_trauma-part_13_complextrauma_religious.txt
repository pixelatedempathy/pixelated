They get cynical about themselves, about the world, about people.

And so some of the persistent negative stuff can be shame messages.

They go right back to the inner critic.

It's your fault.

You're not good enough.

You don't matter.

They can't see it that moment that it's made up of all lies.

Because it feels like the truth.

Somebody just betrayed me.

And so shame messages get louder.

And with that is, I guess I'm just a burden to everybody.

I guess nobody's ever going to want me.

I just don't matter.

People only show love.

They love to me when it's convenient.

When they can get something from me.

And those messages spin around.

And then you can go to nobody's there for me.

Nobody can be trusted in the world.

I'm all alone.

And that just gets darker and darker.

But those are the kind of thoughts that begin to fill the brain.

And create constant chatter in the brain.

Then there's some negative thoughts.

Then there's some physical symptoms that can happen after you've been betrayed.

And these I think are really important to understand.

So again, just think you just find out your husband's cheated on you.

You can go to physically shaking.

And then you can just be constantly agitated.

You can't sit still.

You can't calm yourself.

Your legs jiggling all the time.

Then you can just be sweating a lot.

I've had quite ażyed, Stuck with oneüs.

I would call it that.

But, Everything in your life starts right here.

Now, You can act around the audience that could be like a city or, With your eyes started, up or they have a racing heartbeat others all of a sudden you get aches and pains you get muscle tension you get inflammation all of a sudden that happens or you get migraines headaches that you don't normally get or you're just tired all the time so you can sleep all the time or you can't sleep at all but you're tired all the time so those are some of the physical symptoms that can happen right after you realize you've been betrayed that leads to behavioral symptoms that often happen with people that have been freshly betrayed so i just want to isolate from people i can't face anybody i don't want to have to explain i don't want to have to talk so i'm going to isolate and then crying frequently just can't stop crying decrease in self-care don't take care of yourself don't shut up and don't cry or don't cry or don't cry don't cry or and that can happen a lot of times that's what is happening and you can have anxiety a lot of times you can have anxiety so what i do know is that there's another thing about you can be in a bad situation where you're in a bad situation or you're in a bad situation it can happen you know for example you're in a bad situation don't eat properly, don't sleep properly.

All of that can happen.

Don't do the things that you used to do as healthy self-care or escapes healthy hobbies.

You just can't work as much.

And so there's a decrease in your work productivity.

There's an increase or decrease in your eating.

We've talked about that.

For some, there's an increase in aggressiveness, in reactivity.

The person says the slightest little thing to you and you go into attack mode and you lash out.

That can happen.

Others just spend all their time on social media.

That just numbs them out.

They just scroll through page after page of social media.

Others go into just buying stuff.

And so they make all kinds of unnecessary purchases.

It's a way of numbing.

It's a way of making a living.

It's a way of making a living.

It's a way of making a living.

It's a way of of getting out of that pain for a while.

So others go to alcohol and drugs.

It's a way of numbing.

It's a way of getting out of the pain.

Some go to reckless behavior.

They drive radically.

They all of a sudden do stuff that potentially is quite risky.

They could die, but part of them doesn't care.

If I die, I die.

And so there's an increase in risky behavior.

Then there's relationship symptoms that come out of it, and they're more long term for people.

So they have been betrayed.

Now they are looking at starting a relationship again, just a friendship.

It's not necessarily romantic.

Could be, but it's not necessarily.

But all of a sudden they find that they're struggling to open up.

They're struggling.

They're struggling with any kind of deeper intimacy that just scares them.

They can even be suspicious of kindness.

So somebody super kind to them and they go, are they grooming me?

Is there, what do they want?

Is there a hidden agenda here?

And so they have huge trust issues.

They don't know if they can ever trust again.

So they're suspicious of everything.

And then if they do get in a relationship, they have difficulty maintaining that.

And so they're just kind of getting it out of their head.

that relationship.

Every little thing the person does, they overanalyze, they look for negative, they look for signs of betrayal, they pull away, they test the other person.

And so they have difficulty maintaining relationships.

And then if the other person is wanting to get closer and get to know them better, they're not comfortable with that.

So they're kind of resisting that or pushing people away.

And then they can have jealousy issues.

They start to get in a relationship.

And every time that person talks to somebody else, they just, it stirs up stuff and they get super jealous.

And that can cause trouble.

And then they can have an ODD, oppositional defiance.

So they get in a relationship and the person says, I think you should do this, or here's what I think we should do.

And it's almost like something.

Something is triggered inside of them that I want to do the opposite.

I am not going to follow anybody's advice.

I'm not going to trust anybody's advice.

I have to make all my decisions by myself.

Then for some, now when they get in a relationship to them, if I'm not going to be betrayed by you and I'm going to be able to trust you, then there can be no boundaries.

You can never say no to me.

You can never say you need some personal space.

And so they resist boundaries.

And boundaries to them proves you aren't loyal.

You don't love me.

You don't care.

So what you can see is betrayal trauma sets a person up to have great difficulty in future relationships.

And that is what most people realize is their biggest challenge as they come out of betrayal trauma.

There's one other thing that happens.

There's one other thing that happens with betrayal trauma that includes sexual abuse.

And that is there's sexual symptoms in the future.

And so there can be an aversion to sex.

Sex just makes me feel dirty.

Sex makes me feel awful.

It's disgusting.

And so it just triggers so much painful stuff.

I don't want sex.

Or if I do have sex, it's just I do it out of obligation.

It's not something I enjoy.

But I do.

I do it out of obligation.

Some become just uncomfortable with any physical touch.

Sexual touch doesn't even have to be intercourse.

It's just touch me in any way that feels sexual.

And I just feel this revulsion inside.

Some aren't able to ever achieve orgasm again.

Some during sex, they just check out of their body.

They feel distant.

They dissociate.

Others.

They regularly have sexual flashbacks.

Dreams about the sexual abuse.

Intrusive thoughts about the sexual abuse.

Others have actually physical pain in their sexual organs.

That is an ongoing thing.

And then others have shame.

Sexual shame about what happened.

Body shame about what happened.

And so there's huge ongoing results or ramifications.

That come out of betrayal trauma related to sexual abuse.

There's one other area that is significant for some.

And that's where that betrayal trauma is experienced in your relationship with your higher power.

That you feel God has let you down.

God has betrayed you.

And so all of a sudden you're dealing with anger with God.

So these are spiritual symptoms.

You blame your higher power for that.

You blame your higher power for that.

You blame your higher power for your problems.

And so you lose interest in prayer.

In meditation.

In going to church.

In meeting with other people in your spiritual support group.

You question everything.

You just feel totally abandoned by God.

You doubt that God even exists.

But yet you fear that God's upset with you and is going to judge you.

And that other people in your religion are judging you.

And so that's got massive ramifications as well.

So I hope you're really getting a feel for the fact that this betrayal trauma is huge.

And it has massive ramifications.

It's not just painful.

It just messes up a whole bunch of life.

For years and years and years.

And so what I hope you begin to realize is.

Wow.

You can heal from this.

But it is going to take some work to heal from this.

And it's going to take some special tools to heal from this.

So what are some of the tools that help people heal from betrayal trauma?

And again I want to emphasize there's no quick fix.

Healing from betrayal trauma is a slow, slow process.

And it takes consistent work over a period of months.

And years to begin to heal from this.

So number one.

Acknowledge the betrayal.

Don't keep trying to minimize it or avoid it.

So you have to start by validating I was betrayed.

And it hurt like crazy.

So start with that honesty.

That sees it accurately and acknowledges it.

That is painful.

But that is the first step in beginning to heal.

Secondly.

Don't blame yourself.

For a child to be betrayed is never the child's fault.

So don't blame yourself.

So develop self compassion.

To that child and to yourself today.

That is absolutely essential.

Now if you've been betrayed.

In adult life.

And you are going back and wanting to heal from being cheated on.

Your partner having spent all your money and didn't tell you about it.

Learn from it.

Go back and go.

Why didn't I see the warning signs?

Why was I attracted to somebody who's so dishonest and who's like that?

What is it that I can learn from so I don't repeat this in adult relationships?

And is there something in me that's attracted to somebody like that that I need to look at?

So turn this into a huge growth opportunity.

A time.

A chance to really learn.

Next thing is.

Once you fully validate it.

See it accurately.

Expect.

Okay.

Now you're going to go through the stages of grief.

You're going to go through shock.

Anger.

Depression.

Confusion.

Bargaining.

And then finally reach acceptance.

But you're going to go through a process of starting to come to terms with it.

That's going to take months to get through.

But it will follow the stages of grief process.

The next thing is.

Because what happens for children who've gone through betrayal trauma.

Is they have to become blind to what's happened.

They have to shut down emotionally.

Disconnect from the emotions of it.

They have to really learn.

How to feel emotions.

Identify emotions.

Accept emotions.

Value emotions.

Express emotions.

They have to learn emotional intelligence.

And so that begins by beginning to practice identifying your emotions.

Naming your emotions.

Feeling them in your body.

Feeling them in your emotional world.

And then accepting your emotions.

So begin to do that.

I want to give a caution here.

For a lot of people when they realize that they've been betrayed.

They'll get a response from many well-meaning people that want to pressure them.

You need to forgive that person.

And my response to that is.

Don't let somebody pressure you into.

You need to forgive.

It doesn't work.

What you need to do is.

Allow yourself.

To grieve the pain.

Allow yourself to process through the pain of that betrayal trauma.

Eventually you'll get to forgiveness.

But after it's going to be the result of having worked through all of the pain honestly.

And so just be cautious of people that try to rush you to forgive before.

Actually your brain is ready to forgive.

The next piece is.

Accept the fact.

That rebuilding trust.

And learning how to find safe people is going to be a slow process.

You're not going to be able to meet somebody and immediately be able to go.

Okay, I can trust you 100%.

Not after you've been betrayed.

You need to gradually get to know a person.

And that's going to take months.

And you're going to gradually trust them a little bit to see if they're trustworthy.

If they are, then you're going to have to trust them.

If they are, then you trust them a bit more.

And then a bit more.

And gradually trust builds.

And we don't like that slow process.

Because when we're in that process.

There's an element of the unknown.

Are they going to be fully trustworthy?

Are they going to maybe still let me down?

And we got to sit in this unknown and we don't like it.

But there's no other way to gradually build trust again.

And have healthy relationships.

The next thing is know your triggers.

So if you've been betrayed, you've got a whole bunch of things that will trigger those betrayal feelings.

And once those betrayal feelings are triggered, then you're going to feel like you're being betrayed again.

When probably you're not.

But you're triggered and it feels like it.

So you think it must be happening.

So let's look at this.

Let's say somebody comes up to you and says, Oh, I was just talking to somebody and they talked about you.

Somebody's been talking behind my back.

They probably were saying negative things.

And all of a sudden you feel betrayed.

And you think that friend betrayed you by talking to this other friend.

They might have just been saying good things about you.

But it triggers something.

Or let's say somebody you've known for a while.

All of a sudden reveals a secret to you.

That they haven't shared before.

And you feel like they've been betraying you by having not revealed that secret before.

Because that's what happened in your past.

But maybe they hadn't revealed that secret because they weren't sure they could fully trust you yet.

But it feels like betrayal.

Or let's say somebody confronts you.

And they speak the truth about what you're doing and that it's not right.

Well, that feels like they don't have your back.

That feels like they're turning against you.

They're not loyal.

That feels like betrayal.

Or let's say you're getting to know a friend.

And you really like this friend.

And all of a sudden you see them over having a chat, a deep conversation with somebody else.

That triggers the feelings of betrayal.

Or somebody is super nice to you.

That triggers feeling like you're being groomed.

And so know your triggers.

Because your triggers put you in your limbic brain which has distorted reasoning and lies.

And so if you realize I'm being triggered, you can get back to your cortex and say, That's what I feel but what is the truth?

And that becomes very, very important.

The final thing is if you've gone through betrayal trauma, hopefully you realize this is a big, big topic.

With huge ramifications into every area of life.

I would really encourage you to get help.

Professional help.

Get into a program like our LIFT program.

And we deal with this stuff all the time.

Get to a therapist who understands betrayal trauma.

A support group where you can talk with others who understand betrayal trauma.

All of that is so important in healing from this.

You often can't do it totally.

You can't do it.

You're completely alone.

You need professional help.

Now I just give you a caution.

That one of the things that if you get in a support group, which I hope you will, is that then you can be in danger of trauma bonding.

So you find out somebody else that's betrayed deeply in similar ways to you.

And you have a connection.

And all of a sudden you go, Oh, I just feel so close to this person.

But they're messed up.

You're messed up.

And you get in this relationship.

And then you get betrayed again.

So just be aware of trauma bonding that can take place between two people that have gone through betrayal trauma.

Well, this has been a tough topic.

But I hope it's been insightful.

Because you can't understand complex trauma unless you understand that it includes betrayal trauma.

And it is painful stuff with far-reaching impact.

That's the end of our time.
