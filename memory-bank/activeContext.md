# Active Context

## Current Focus
Active development across multiple features with established Memory Bank system. Project in Phase 2 development with bias detection engine, frontend interface, and infrastructure components in progress. Multiple workstreams active including AI/ML enhancements, enterprise features, and advanced analytics.

## Recent Changes
- ✅ **Memory Bank System Complete**: All 6 core memory bank files created and configured
- ✅ **Custom Commands Framework**: Established command storage and workflow documentation
- ✅ **File-based Memory System**: Implemented comprehensive documentation system for session continuity
- ✅ **Documentation Standards**: Implemented comprehensive documentation system for session continuity
- ✅ **ML Model Integration**: Real ML models integrated into bias detection service
- ✅ **Import Issues Resolved**: Fixed placeholder adapter import problems
- ✅ **Service Integration**: Bias detection service updated with real ML implementations
- ✅ **Frontend-Production API Integration**: Complete integration with production bias analysis API
  - Frontend updated to call `/api/bias-analysis/analyze` instead of demo endpoint
  - Request/response data structure mapping implemented
  - Client-side counterfactual scenarios and historical comparison generation
  - Real-time performance maintained (<2 second response times)
  - Database persistence confirmed working
- ✅ **Health Monitoring System**: Comprehensive health checks and monitoring implemented
  - Simple health endpoint (`/api/health/simple`) for basic status checks
  - Advanced health endpoint (`/api/health`) with detailed system diagnostics
  - Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes configured
  - Monitoring scripts for cluster health assessment
  - Traefik load balancer health checks integrated
- ✅ **Infrastructure Hardening**: Production-ready infrastructure components
  - Traefik reverse proxy with dynamic configuration
  - Kubernetes deployment with rolling updates and auto-scaling
  - Comprehensive monitoring and alerting setup
  - Security headers and CORS configuration
  - Rate limiting and DDoS protection implemented

## Active Commands & Custom Workflows

### Custom Commands
You can create custom commands and workflows here in the Memory Bank. Here are some examples:

#### Quick Builds
- `npm run build:prod` - Production build with optimizations
- `npm run build:dev` - Development build with hot reload
- `npm run docker:build` - Build all docker containers

#### Development Workflows
- `git commit` - Always write descriptive commit messages
- `npm run lint:fix` - Auto-fix linting issues
- `npm run test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage report

#### Integration Testing Commands
- `pnpm test:integration` - Run complete integration test suite
- `pnpm test:integration:api` - Test bias detection API integration
- `pnpm test:integration:system` - Test complete system integration
- `pnpm test:integration:performance` - Run performance integration tests
- `cd tests/integration && pnpm test` - Run integration tests with custom runner

#### Deployment Commands
- `kubectl apply -f k8s/` - Deploy to Kubernetes cluster
- `docker-compose up -d` - Start all services in detached mode
- `helm upgrade pixelated ./helm` - Deploy via Helm chart

#### Custom Aliases (Add your own here)
- `mb:update` - Update Memory Bank after significant changes
- `bias:check` - Run bias detection analysis on current code
- `security:audit` - Run security audit on the codebase
- `integration:test` - Run full integration test suite

## Next Steps
1. **Bias Detection MVP**: Complete working end-to-end bias detection service
2. **API Integration**: Establish robust API endpoints and testing framework
3. **Frontend Development**: Build functional user interface for bias analysis
4. **Infrastructure Setup**: Complete Docker and Kubernetes configurations
5. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implement automated testing and deployment workflows
6. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize AI model inference and response times

## Important Reminders
- **Always read ALL Memory Bank files** at the start of tasks
- **Update activeContext.md** when discovering new patterns or creating custom commands
- **Document everything** to maintain perfect context across sessions
- **Test custom commands** thoroughly before relying on them

## Custom Context
This section is for project-specific context and custom instructions:

### Project Conventions
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Run tests before committing
- Update documentation for significant changes

### Environment Notes
- Primary development happens in `/src` directory
- Python services are in `src/lib/ai/bias-detection/python-service/`
- Docker services are configured in `docker-compose.yml`
- Production deployments use Helm charts in `helm/` directory

### Common Workflows
1. Make changes to code
2. Run tests: `npm test`
3. Build: `npm run build`
4. Deploy: Check deployment guides in docs/

Add your custom commands and context here as needed for your specific workflow.
