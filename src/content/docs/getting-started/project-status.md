# Project Status and Documentation

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Pixelated project's current status, completed features, and upcoming development plans. It follows the guidelines outlined in the `.cursorrules` file and serves as a central reference for project documentation.

## Project Architecture

Pixelated is built using the following technology stack:

- **Astro 5.6.1**: Main framework, with built-in routing and component system
- **TypeScript**: For type-safe development
- **UnoCSS**: For styling (replacing previously used Tailwind CSS)
- **Supabase**: For authentication and database functionality

- **Redis**: For caching and session management
- **Web Audio API**: For audio processing features
- **TensorFlow.js**: For machine learning capabilities
- **Node-SEAL**: For zero-knowledge encryption implementation
- **Vercel**: For deployment and hosting

## Project Structure

The project follows Astro's recommended structure:

- `src/pages/`: File-based routing
- `src/components/`: Reusable UI components
- `src/layouts/`: Page layouts
- `src/content/`: Content collections
- `src/styles/`: Global styles
- `public/`: Static assets
- `docs/`: Project documentation
- `api/`: API endpoints

## Completed Features

### Authentication System

- ✅ Complete authentication flow with Supabase integration
- ✅ Login form with dark theme styling
- ✅ Centered form elements with proper spacing
- ✅ Password reset flow with secure token handling
- ✅ HttpOnly cookies for secure token storage
- ✅ Auth callback route for secure token processing

### UI/UX Improvements

- ✅ Antfu-inspired dark theme throughout the application
- ✅ Consistent navigation between homepage and dashboard
- ✅ Plum background animation exclusive to the homepage
- ✅ Standardized component system for UI consistency
- ✅ Centralized CSS variables and utility classes
- ✅ Optimized layouts to prevent unnecessary scrolling
- ✅ Enhanced visual feedback for user interactions

### Performance Optimizations

- ✅ Fixed manifest.json 404 errors
- ✅ Normalized file paths in the watch system
- ✅ Implemented proper file structure for better maintenance
- ✅ Created reusable components to reduce code duplication

### Dashboard Functionality

- ✅ Authentication checks on dashboard access
- ✅ Centered text for better visual balance
- ✅ Consistent styling with the rest of the application

## In-Progress Features

- ⏳ Form validation and error messages
- ⏳ Remember me functionality
- ⏳ CSRF protection for auth forms
- ⏳ Sidebar navigation for dashboard
- ⏳ User profile section
- ⏳ Data visualization components

## Future Development Plans

### Short-term Goals (Next Sprint)

1. Complete form validation across all authentication forms
2. Implement toast notifications for user feedback
3. Add page transition animations between routes
4. Create a style guide page showing all UI components
5. Apply standardized components to all remaining pages
6. Develop comprehensive test coverage for authentication flows

### Medium-term Goals (Next 2-3 Sprints)

1. Implement data visualization components for the dashboard
2. Create user profile management functionality
3. Add advanced search capabilities
4. Implement real-time collaboration features
5. Enhance accessibility features to meet WCAG 2.1 standards

### Long-term Goals

1. Develop custom scenario creation tools
2. Implement advanced therapeutic technique detection
3. Add support for multi-language simulations
4. Create integration with continuing education platforms
5. Develop community features for shared insights

## Documentation Structure

The project documentation is organized as follows:

- `docs/architecture.mdx`: System architecture overview
- `docs/introduction.mdx`: Project introduction and key features
- `docs/component-library.md`: UI component documentation
- `docs/project-status.md`: This document, tracking overall progress
- `.notes/status.mdx`: Detailed tracking of completed and in-progress tasks
- `.notes/tasks.mdx`: Granular task management and tracking

## Coding Standards

All code in this project adheres to the following standards:

1. TypeScript for type safety
2. Proper Astro component structure with correct frontmatter syntax
3. Appropriate use of Astro's built-in features
4. UnoCSS for styling with centralized variables
5. Component-based architecture with reusability in mind
6. Proper error handling and validation
7. Comprehensive documentation
8. Security best practices and HIPAA compliance

## Conclusion

The Pixelated project has made significant progress in establishing a robust foundation with a complete authentication system and consistent UI/UX. The focus on documentation and following best practices has created a maintainable codebase that can be extended for future features. The next phases of development will build upon this foundation to create a comprehensive healthcare platform that combines advanced AI capabilities with secure, HIPAA-compliant infrastructure.
