## üöÄ Key Features

### Intelligent Pipeline Routing

The orchestrator analyzes code changes and automatically routes them through optimized pipelines:

- **Demo-Focused**: For UI/UX changes to demo pages
- **Security-Critical**: For security-related modifications
- **Infrastructure**: For deployment and configuration changes
- **Full-Suite**: For high-risk or complex changes

### ML-Based Risk Assessment

Advanced machine learning algorithms assess:
- Change complexity and impact
- Historical failure patterns
- Security implications
- Deployment risk factors

### Zero-Downtime Deployments

Sophisticated deployment strategies:
- **Canary Deployments**: Gradual traffic shifting with automated rollback
- **Blue-Green Deployments**: Instant environment switching
- **Standard Deployments**: Traditional approach for low-risk changes

### Comprehensive Security Validation

Enterprise-grade security features:
- HIPAA compliance checking
- Mental health data protection validation
- Advanced threat detection
- Vulnerability scanning
- Security policy enforcement

## üìä Pipeline Strategies

### Strategy Selection Matrix

| Change Type | Risk Level | Pipeline Strategy | Deployment Strategy |
|-------------|------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Demo Pages | Low | demo-focused | blue-green |
| Security Files | High | security-critical | canary |
| Infrastructure | Medium | infrastructure | canary |
| Core Libraries | High | full-suite | canary |
| Configuration | Medium | standard | standard |

### Quality Gates

Dynamic quality gates based on:
- **Risk Level**: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- **Complexity Score**: 0-100 scale
- **Failure Probability**: ML-predicted likelihood
- **Compliance Requirements**: HIPAA, Enterprise standards

## üõ°Ô∏è Security & Compliance

### HIPAA Compliance Validation

Automated checks for:
- **¬ß164.312(a)(2)(iv)**: Encryption requirements
- **¬ß164.312(a)(1)**: Access control implementation
- **¬ß164.312(b)**: Audit controls
- **¬ß164.312(c)(1)**: Data integrity
- **¬ß164.312(e)(1)**: Transmission security
- **¬ß164.524**: Patient rights management

### Mental Health Data Protection

Specialized validation for:
- Crisis intervention data security
- Bias detection input sanitization
- FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) implementation
- Data anonymization capabilities
- Secure communication channels

### Advanced Threat Detection

Multi-layered security scanning:
- Static code analysis (Bandit, ESLint Security)
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Secrets detection
- Malicious code pattern recognition
- Configuration security validation

## üéØ Quality Metrics

### Scoring System

- **Quality Score**: 0-100 (inverse of risk score)
- **Security Score**: 0-100 (threat level + compliance)
- **Compliance Score**: 0-100 (HIPAA + data protection)
- **Risk Score**: 0-100 (complexity + change impact)

### Thresholds

| Environment | Min Quality | Min Security | Min Compliance |
|-------------|-------------|--------------|----------------|
| Production | 80 | 85 | 90 |
| Staging | 70 | 75 | 80 |
| Development | 60 | 65 | 70 |
