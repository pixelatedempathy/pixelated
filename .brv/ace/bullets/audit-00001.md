Journal Dataset Research System audit completed: Critical finding - Task Group 2 (Source Discovery Engine) completely missing. No implementation of PubMed, DOAJ, Dryad, Zenodo, or ClinicalTrials.gov clients. 40+ test failures across CLI, documentation, and pipeline integration. Class naming inconsistencies (DatasetEvaluationEngine vs EvaluationEngine, AccessAcquisitionManager vs AcquisitionManager). Full audit report saved to .kiro/specs/journal-dataset-research/AUDIT_REPORT.md
