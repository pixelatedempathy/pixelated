Well welcome to another Friday night.

We've been going through a series on life traps or prisons that come out of complex trauma and it's really looking at the things that children had to do to survive.

So the behavior patterns, the thinking patterns, the emotion patterns that developed because of their trauma in childhood that they successfully used to survive all of that and even to look like they were doing really well.

But now in adult life those very patterns are causing them to have all kinds of problems.

They're preventing healthy relationships, they're hurting their children, they're messing up jobs and starting to take their toll on them personally.

But when people go to change those all of a sudden they find there's something in them that doesn't want to change them.

There's something in them that gravitates back and forth between them and their children.

And so they're trying to back to those as a default setting as a place that feels very normal and almost safe to them.

And so it's a huge challenge for people in recovery from complex trauma to realize that many of the things that they did to survive now have become prisons and they're really challenging to begin to change.

And so we've been identifying some of the major life traps or prisons that people have when they come out of complex trauma.

And today I want to look at one that is so prevalent, so common, and it's people pleasing.

And part of what makes it so difficult for people is they got tons of validation for it.

It wasn't just that it helped them succeed and survive, it got them tons of validation.

So somebody has said this about this life trap.

This is the person who to a large degree experiences the world in terms of their life.

And they're not just the person who's going to die, they're going to experience the world in terms of their life.

And they're going to experience the world in terms of control issues.

Other people in their life always seem to be in control.

They feel controlled by the people around them.

At the core is the conviction that they must please others, that they must please parents, brothers, sisters, friends, teachers, lovers, spouses, bosses, co-workers, children, and even strangers.

In all likelihood, the only exception to this rule of people pleasing, the only person they do not feel obliged to please is themselves.

It is what the other person wants that comes first.

This life trap is also known as the subjugation life track.

So you've always felt subjugated to the needs of others, the desires of others.

So I need to say up front, there is a healthy people pleasing.

I think children come into the world with a desire to please, and it comes from a very innocent, pure place.

We're not talking about healthy people pleasing.

We're talking about unhealthy people pleasing.

Healthy people pleasing always comes from the motive of pure love, and it always has boundaries.

Your needs matter just as much as mine.

I will sometimes say no to your requests when you want me to please them, and it goes against my other priorities.

It goes against my values.

It goes against taking care of my family.

It goes against my children.

It goes against my family.

It goes against my children.

It goes against my family.

It goes against my family.

I don't care about myself properly.

So people pleasing that's healthy always has boundaries and comes from the right motive.

What we're talking about is unhealthy people pleasing, and that is people pleasing that comes from the wrong motive.

I am doing it so that I benefit in some way, and there's not proper boundaries.

So I am taking care of you more than I'm taking care of me.

Your needs matter more than my needs.

that is what we're going to be looking at today.

It is so important to understand that.

And part of why I want to emphasize that is because this life trap for many people is very hard to identify as a negative thing.

They see themselves as a loving, good person who just wants to help others.

They haven't looked at their motive truly or accurately.

They just think they want to help others.

They're eager to please.

They're usually liked by most everybody.

They're easy to get along with.

They're proud of their ability to be there for others.

Also, many have trouble seeing it as negative because they look at their lives and they do a lot of good.

They help a lot of people and a lot of causes.

And so they, in their mind, go, how can this be a bad thing?

They also receive tons of value.

Validation.

They're almost put on a pedestal as a saint, as a hero, because of how much they help others.

And it gets them respect.

It gets them tremendous amounts of praise and validation.

And so they go, how can this be a negative thing?

So again, to me, the issue isn't that you're doing good to others.

The issue is two things.

Your motivation, why you're doing good to others.

And sometimes you've got to give that some careful thought because your initial answer is actually a self-deceptive answer.

But secondly, over time, a people pleaser who's doing it for the wrong reasons, without the proper boundaries, is going to experience collateral damage to themselves and to their family.

They're helping themselves, but they're not helping themselves.

And so they're not helping themselves, except for themselves and their family in the way they should.

And they're starting to hurt themselves and their family.

That becomes the key issue.

And so most people don't see this problem.

They don't see this as a life trap for themselves until two things.

Number one, they're so exhausted, they just can't keep going.

They're burning themselves out.

And they begin to see that they're the only one giving in relationships.

They never receive.

It's always about others' needs, never about their needs.

So they begin to see that because they're burning out.

Secondly, they begin to see that they're hurting their children.

Their children are getting a resentment towards them for always helping others, but not being there for them.

And so they begin to see the damage it's doing to their children and how their children are suffering.

So those are the two things that it usually takes before a person is able to turn them into adults.

Not simply seeming at least half my time but at least a little bit more important sense of του.

So what you need to understand is step one is always when you're doing this, what's the value that you really want before you.

If you're going to melt away and run through things when you're too much information, you want to know what it is that you're lacking in.

After you get through everything and in fact getting through twoPop employees, you increase your value of material value and at the end user navigation.

Absolutely remain positive all the way through it this way.

And then if it's rich enough or not, you go from one of your at what level are you going to get completely out of your control at the beginning.

Then at the Abu Dhabi module of sat, 9a2, is what's going to happen.

It's going to lead you to this process of narcissism.

five or six to any of the answers, regardless of your score, this is a life trap that you need to look at carefully.

So question one, I let other people control me.

Two, I am afraid that if I do not give in to other people's wishes, they will retaliate, get angry, or reject me.

Three, I feel the major decisions in my life were not really my own.

Four, I have a lot of trouble demanding that other people respect my rights.

Five, I worry a lot about pleasing people and getting their approval.

Six, I go to great lengths to avoid confrontation.

Seven, I give more to other people than I get back in return.

Eight, I feel the pain of other people deeply, so I usually end up taking care of the people I'm close to.

Nine, I feel guilty when I put myself first.

Ten, I am a victim of my own.

five, I have a feeling that I am a victim of my own.

Six, I don't want any of you to know how much I know about my position in a little bit more detail than I do.

Seven, I feel am a good person because I think of others more than of myself.

So the scoring, if you get a 10 to 19, probably doesn't apply to you.

20 to 29, this life trap may apply to you occasionally.

30 to 39, it's probably an issue in your life.

40 to 49, it's definitely an important life trap for you to consider.

And 50 to 60, it's definitely one of your core life traps.

So where does this come from?

Why do people end up being people pleasers?

So again, multiple different ways that this can be produced in a child as their way of adapting in order to survive.

But number one, you could have had parents who basically tried to control, dominate every aspect of your life.

They didn't allow you to make decisions, they made them all for you.

Or you had parents who punished you for doing something that you didn't want to do.

They punished you, threatened you, or got angry when you didn't do things their way.

So they really reacted negatively and powerfully.

Or your parents withdrew emotionally or cut off contact with you or withdrew love from you if you disagreed with them about how to do things.

So they punished you in passive aggressive ways.

Or your parents did not allow you to make your own choices as a child.

Or because you're, mom or dad wasn't around enough or wasn't capable enough, you ended up having to take care of your siblings, the rest of the family.

Or your parents always talked to you about their personal problems so that you were always in the role of the listener.

Or your parents made you feel guilty or selfish if you would not do what you wanted.

So they accused you of being selfish.

Or your parents were like martyrs or Saints.

They selflessly took care of everyone else and denied their own needs.

So that was your, what was role modeled to you.

Your parents had this life trap as well.

You did not feel that your rights, needs, or opinions were respected when you were a child.

They were minimized, they were just rejected.

The only way you could get your needs met, or not be hurt or rejected, was to be what others wanted you to be.

So you had to learn to be a chameleon, to just switch into all kinds of different roles so you wouldn't get hurt or so that people would meet your needs.

You had to be very careful about what you did or said as a child because you worried that if you said or did the wrong thing, your parents would get very depressed.

It would mess them up and they would get really down.

Or you often felt angry at your parents for not giving you the freedom that other children had.

Or your parents taught you a definition of love that was actually a definition of codependency.

And it was basically that you should constantly deny your needs and sacrifice for others.

That's actually a wrong definition.

But that's what you got.

Your parents had a belief system that if you took care of yourself in healthy ways, that you were being lazy or selfish.

Peace in your family was not about justice and love happening.

It was about submitting to what a narcissist wanted.

And so as long as everybody fully submitted to what the narcissist wanted, there was peace or what looked like peace.

Everybody could relax.

And so what got emphasized in your family as a strong value is submission.

You need to submit to the authority.

That's the only way to have peace.

Possibly you grew up where your parents saw you as a unique child, a child who was a bit different.

And they were afraid to let you kind of have autonomy, to do your own thing, to follow your dreams, to follow your desires, because they were afraid that you would go against social norms, that others would start looking down on your family because you were so different.

And so they had to try to control you and keep you in a box.

Or you grew up in a family where your parents saw children as being naturally selfish.

And so it was emphasized to them that they had to train you to be obedient, to train you to be responsible.

Because if they just let you go, then you would just be irresponsible and wild.

And so their focus was not to understand their children or to meet their children's emotional needs.

Their focus was get your children to obey, get your children to be responsible.

It's possible you grew up in a family where your parents kind of gave you the role of being the hero child.

You were going to be the perfect child.

You were going to be the child that took care of everybody else, super responsible, sacrificed all your needs, and you got tons of validation for being that child.

Or you grew up with a parent who was a narcissist.

It was all about what they wanted.

It was their way or the highway.

They abused their position of authority.

It was all about them getting, what they wanted.

There was no discussion, negotiation, or compromise.

And so their needs, their desires, always were placed ahead of everybody else's and you were expected to submit.

So those are some of the things that could have happened in your childhood.

Now let me take it then to complex trauma.

Because all of those ways of parenting or things you might have experienced would have...

made a child feel unsafe.

They would have been little t trauma.

And so the child would have adapted because of that.

Let me put it in terms of complex trauma in four ways.

What is happening in all of those things?

So when there is danger, the brain's first two responses is the first two F's, fight or flight.

Let's fight back.

Let's get ourselves safe through running away or fighting.

The problem for most children is they're too little to fight or flight.

And so the brain goes, okay, those two F's don't work.

Let's go to the third F, freeze.

And so they start shutting down.

They start suppressing all their needs, all their emotions in order to survive.

But then the brain says, but I'm so little, I still need others to meet my needs because I can't meet them myself.

So they have to go to the fourth F.

And that's fawning.

And fawning is what I want you to see, the most extreme last resort survival tactic that the brain comes up with.

And basically what fawning is, is you be what others want.

You people please.

You never say no.

You always be pleasant.

You give up all your needs and take care of people.

You be attuned to other people and what they want.

And their needs, not to yourself, because that's the only way to survive.

So you look like a wonderful child.

You look like the most agreeable, giving, caring child in the world, but you're fawning.

You're desperately trying to survive.

You're giving so that somebody hopefully won't hurt you, so that somebody hopefully will meet your needs.

So fawning is last resort survival.

Survival method that the brain comes up with when someone is small and their needs are not being met.

Life is dangerous for them, but they desperately need somebody to care for them.

Now what comes out of all of the complex trauma is the child develops shame.

They develop the belief that the reason they're being neglected and abused and abandoned is it's their fault.

So they don't like themselves.

They think I'm the problem.

I'm not lovable.

I'm not good enough.

I'm inferior to everybody else.

And so people pleasing comes out of this shame as well.

Because how do I get people to like me?

I need them to like me because I don't like myself.

So the only way I'm going to get positive feelings towards myself is if other people have positive feelings towards me.

So I have to get people to like me if I'm going to feel better about myself.

So how do I do that?

I please them.

I give them what they want.

I'm super kind to them.

I give them gifts.

All of those things become part of what I need to do to try to solve my shame.

But more than that, shame is also I don't respect myself.

And deep down I believe nobody else will either if they see the real me.

So the only way people will respect me and therefore so that they can be happy, and therefore so that I can respect myself, is if I please them.

If they really like me, if I do whatever they want, then they will respect me.

That's again what they hope will be the solution to their shame.

But another part of shame is I can't stand up for myself.

I can't say no to anybody because if I do they will get mad at me.

They won't like me for saying no.

They will reject me.

They will see how terrible I am.

Therefore, I can't have anybody reject me.

I can't ever stand up for myself because that will expose my shame.

So I must please, please, please people constantly to try to solve my shame.

So shame is such a huge factor behind people pleasing.

But there's another factor that comes out of complex trauma and that is guilt.

So many families with complex trauma and that create complex trauma have the cycle of abuse.

And what comes out of that is after the violence takes place, or the blow up happens, the crisis happens, everybody's on their best behavior.

Everybody's people pleasing.

Why?

Because they feel bad about what they just did.

They're trying to make up for what they just did.

And so now they're just saying yes to everybody, people pleasing to make up for their guilt.

And what happens?

What happens to a lot of parents who've done a lot of damage by being involved in addiction, in criminal activity, been in jail, and now they're back with their kids, they just say yes to their kids constantly because of guilt.

They're afraid to say no because they're afraid their kids are going to get upset and feel that their parents are being mean again.

A fourth thing that comes out of complex trauma is that you learn to submit.

You learn to put your needs aside out of fear.

Because if you stand up for yourself, you're going to get punished.

You're going to get hurt.

It's going to go bad for you.

And so fear is a huge issue under this submission.

So what I want you to realize is what's coming out of complex trauma is people pleasing isn't done out of love.

Though there might still be traces of that.

It is done out of love.

It is done out of need to survive, fawning.

It is done out of shame.

It is done out of fear.

It is done out of guilt.

It is done out of negative emotions that are fueling this need to people please, to try to not get hurt, to try to get my needs met, to survive.

So let's expand the characteristics of what a people pleaser looks like, and then we begin to identify in yourself if you have this characteristic, this life trap.

And there's quite a number of characteristics.

So number one, you let other people have their own way most of the time.

You just kind of give in to what others want as your norm.

Or you're too eager to please.

You will do almost anything to be liked or accepted.

Or you do not like what others want.

You tend to like to disagree openly with other people's opinions.

You tend to agree with people even though deep down inside you disagree.

You're more comfortable when other people are in positions of control or leadership making the decisions.

You'd rather be a follower.

You will do almost anything to avoid confrontation or anger.

Words might hurt you as a follower, and you are more like the different��게 and understanding yourself is actually what I talk about with the vision for a person.

I talk about experience, about people I want to work with.

But here's the care I might need that wall-�로ce work to reach this talk of what I've done so far has been helpful.

I want to be better.

Like I said.

I believe I've got the answers to this simple career shift.

your passions are, whether this is the career for you.

You always end up taking care of everyone else.

Almost no one listens to or takes care of you.

So if you back away from your life and start to look at it honestly, you're always in the caretaking role.

Seldom do others take care of you.

You do not stand up for your rights or you feel guilty if you do stand up for your needs or your rights.

You cannot stand to say or do anything that hurts other people's feelings.

That just causes you to feel all kinds of guilt.

You find it hard to say no when someone asks you for help.

Often you'll say yes and then try to find a way to say no.

You'll say no and then try to wiggle out of it.

You feel guilty when you ask for what you want or you set a boundary with someone.

So again, anytime you say no, set a boundary, stand up for yourself, your first response is guilt.

You often stay in situations where you feel trapped or your needs are not met, but for some reason you can't get out of that situation.

You don't leave the situation, you stay.

You do not want other people to see you as selfish, so you go to the other extreme of constantly giving.

You often sacrifice yourself for the sake of other people.

So self-sacrificing person has become your identity.

You often take on more than your share of responsibilities at home or at work, and therefore you're constantly over committing.

When other people are troubled or in pain, your first go-to response is to jump in and try to make them feel better, even if it's going to be at your own expense.

You often feel angry, but never express it at other people for telling you what to do or for using you.

And you seldom express your anger aggressively.

You get very good at passively expressing your anger.

You get very good at giving in Looks.

You get very serious about being aggressive at those things.

But it's hard to do that when you're with a loved one, and to be honest, it's easier for a loved one.

To be приз 머리- igual.

Imp스트� like some of the other bad BJ's toseven.

Even if they know you're shy or engaged, they're not shy, but it's only going to get you worked up.

It is scary to see your temper then.

We tend to roll around telling them why these actions were taken wrong, or your who have the eyes, would not be honest and equally shall waggled about offering them gezital meaning.

But you will be more nervous about them knowing that you are admitted for them.

When we've had this more infatuated physical encounter with our good Cocoa-stressed partner, the相 at the cashier.

You know he is far happier to be alone at home also than your way of responding to requests of others.

You often feel cheated, that you are giving more than you're getting back.

If there are problems in a relationship, you often feel you can get it to work out if you just try a little harder, if you are just a little more pleasing.

You feel that you lack integrity because you accommodate people too much and don't take care of yourself.

So somehow you see you lack integrity there.

People tell you that you're not aggressive or ambitious enough.

So they're constantly saying you're too passive.

You should stand up for yourself more.

You play down your own accomplishments.

You have trouble being strong in negotiations.

You're just more quickly to accommodate anything.

You often give in to make peace.

Often you feel used or taken for granted.

You complain about how much people take advantage of you, but then you don't do anything to change it.

You often feel trapped.

You just feel unable to improve the circumstances of your life.

You take courses trying to figure out a way to improve your situation, but it never seems to improve.

And that's because you don't deal with this.

People pleasing thing.

You sometimes feel more like a slave with all kinds of masters than a free person.

You feel that your life is not your own.

You're more attuned to the needs of others than to your own needs.

You want to know your own needs are.

You can't be happy unless other people in your life are happy.

You think you're in control of your life, but in one sense it looks like others control you.

Others decide your day and your life.

You often do stuff you don't want to do or have a passion for.

You do it because somebody else wants you to.

While you appear to be very pleasing on the outside to those who are in authority, in your head you are lashing out against them.

You're full of anger and resentment towards all these people using you.

You lose yourself and others and sometimes don't know where you end and where they start.

You know what they're feeling better than what you are feeling.

You know what they think better than you think.

You often feel sorry for yourself and have resentments.

So those two things become common emotions for you.

When it comes to the end of the day, you're in a position to be a little bit more patient.

You're in a position to be a little bit more patient.

You're in a position to be a little bit more patient.

When it comes to building a friendship or a relationship, you often don't take the initiative.

You let the other person take the initiative.

You let the other person set the boundaries and then you respond.

You feel out of control in most areas of your life.

Others control everything you do.

So you become over-controlled in certain areas of your life, like the tidiness of your room, your exercise program.

You also take control in eating and develop eating disorders.

Or you exercise control by you do self-harm and others can't control that because you do that privately.

And so out of control in one area, so you become super-controlled in other areas, but often in self-harming ways.

You people please with everybody outside of your home.

But when you're in control, you're in control.

But when you're in control, you're in control.

When you come home, you do the opposite.

You don't care about the needs of your children or your partner.

You get angry, demanding.

You rebel against what they want you to do.

You take out your anger and frustration on them.

Or you might be what is referred to as the perfect waiter in a restaurant.

You anticipate what the customer wants, even before the customer is aware of it or asks for it.

You fulfill their needs.

You fulfill their needs and wishes quickly and seamlessly without them even asking or seeing what you're doing.

You feel pressure to be nice all the time.

To be friendly and pleasant all the time.

You feel constant stress all the time because you have so many responsibilities that you have taken on.

You have lived this people-pleasing way for so long that you no longer, even know what your own needs are.

You're no longer aware that you have needs.

You have somehow turned off your hunger-thirst sensation that goes with every need that you have.

And so you often begin to think that you don't have needs.

So those are the characteristics.

I don't know how you did.

You might be quite shocked to realize how many of those are true of you.

So let's move now to recovery.

So before we get to the healing, I want to talk about dangers in recovery.

Because what has happened in childhood is that this way of coping became your default setting.

It became a subconscious template in your brain.

And you gravitate back to it today without even realizing it.

And so when you get into relationships today, you naturally go back to this very old, unhealthy but what feels normal way of relating to people.

And so that can cause you to be actually attracted to unhealthy people, to set up relationship dynamics in the early days that are actually unhealthy and are going to destroy the relationship.

So what do you watch out for?

So just be aware that your initial go-to in any new relationship, is to sacrifice your needs.

To give, to take care of the other person, to not express your needs, that somehow you are going to earn their love.

If you're aware of that, don't fall into that.

That is going to get you into trouble if you begin to follow that again.

Also, you're also going to be attracted to people who have a very strong sense of self, who can take the leadership, who know what they want, who are very good at what they do, who are very good at what they do, and who are very good at what they do.

And so that can be healthy, but it can be very unhealthy.

It can be a narcissist.

But be aware that you're attracted to that, and that you're naturally then going to want to just go in and help, and take care of, and submit to them.

So as you get to know this person, be aware if they become very domineering and expect you to do things their way.

Be aware if your partner becomes irritated or angry when you don't do what they want, when you disagree with them, when you don't take care of them the way they want.

And so it's all about taking care of them and not about your needs.

If your partner starts pouting or pulling away from you when you're not doing what they want, another danger sign.

If your partner is easily hurt or upset so that you feel that, I got to walk on eggshells, I got to make sure I don't do anything that would upset them, that's a danger sign.

If you have to watch what you say or do because it might set your partner off, they might explode, or they might get depressed, they might start drinking a lot, another danger sign.

Or be aware that if a partner is just constantly needy, incompetent, doesn't do anything, or does everything poorly, and you want to jump in and do it for them.

Very dangerous.

Or you could have a partner who's just very unreliable, very irresponsible.

They always had mommy taking care of them and doing everything for them.

And so they just continue to be irresponsible and now you want to jump in and do everything for them.

Be very alert if your partner doesn't respect your opinions.

Isn't alert to your needs and respect your needs just as much as their own.

Be aware that often you'll let early in the relationship your partner make most of the decisions and you just want to follow.

You want them to lead.

But that can set up bad dynamics.

Especially if you start letting them make decisions and do things that really go against what you want.

Be aware that if your partner makes you feel guilty or accuses you of being selfish when they ask you to do something their way and you set a boundary and say no.

And your boundary is very healthy.

Be aware that if you are in a relationship where your partner constantly is sad, having a crisis, struggling, and you end up being the counselor.

Always the one that's listening.

Always the one that's taking care of their needs.

That could be very dangerous.

And be aware of a partner that's just very dependent on you.

That they can't do, they don't want to learn a lot of tools to do a lot of skills.

They just want to depend on you and let you do it for them.

So those are just things to be aware of as you begin to build relationships and recovery.

That if you give in to this old template that might look good in the beginning but man it is going to end up with a disastrous relationship in the end.

So let's move to how do we heal this template.

This template that let us survive.

This template that got us respect and validation that really seemed to work but now is causing all kinds of problems in our intimate relationships even though we're getting tons of validation still from people outside of our family.

So let me break it down.

What I think is some very basic simple things but important things.

Begin by understanding how this developed for you in childhood.

Get in touch with that child that was subjugated that had to give up their needs and take care of everybody else and just submit.

Just get in touch with what they felt.

What it was like for them.

Really develop that in your mind.

And then begin to list the ways you do today people pleasing.

The ways you sacrifice.

You submit.

You put your needs aside.

List those.

Itemize that.

So you begin to see how much how often it takes place.

Then start forming.

Sitting down and going what do I like?

What are my preferences?

What are my opinions?

In every aspect of life.

What kind of movies do I like?

What kind of foods do I like?

How do I like to use my leisure time?

Where am I on the political spectrum?

About what do I think about current controversial issues?

How do I think about how I use my time?

Begin to really define for yourself your needs and your desires.

And then make a list.

Of what you do or give to others.

And what they give to you.

How much time do you spend listening to others versus how much time do they listen to you?

How much do you sacrifice for others versus how much they sacrifice to you?

How much you give of your money?

How much you give of your time?

How much you give of your resources versus what others do for you?

Begin to see accurately.

And if it's not close to 50% if it's way out of balance then you really have to look closely at that.

Stop behaving passive aggressively.

Push yourself to assert yourself.

To express your needs.

To express your displeasure when your needs are not being considered.

When your opinions are not being considered.

Now what I would say is start with kind of easy stuff first.

Expressing your needs and desires.

In the easier ways first.

Practice asking others for help.

Practice asking others to meet your needs.

Discuss your problems with others.

Be open and vulnerable with safe people.

So what you're trying to do is develop a balance between meeting others needs and them meeting your needs.

But that means you have to communicate your needs.

And so you need to begin to practice doing that with safe people.

Now the big one is you got to heal your shame.

You can do all kinds of things to stop people pleasing that I've just described.

But if you don't heal your shame you're going to go back to people pleasing.

And healing your shame is such a big one.

And so again part of our Lift Course part of the video series on YouTube is all about shame.

And so I just encourage you that this is such a key part of the healing journey.

It's not just about learning some very practical tools.

It's about healing a core issue.

Then practice saying no.

And so for some people it's important for them to realize that no is a complete sentence.

They can just say no to people's requests.

They don't have to give an explanation.

They don't have to justify their no.

They can just say no.

But practice saying no.

Practice setting boundaries.

Now I need to say that when you say no and set boundaries you're probably your initial internal response is you're going to feel guilty.

You're going to feel that you're selfish.

You might even then get accused by those in your family who are used to you being a people pleaser.

They're going to accuse you now of being selfish.

They're going to even accuse you of being a narcissist.

And so that's where you need a healthy person that's going to come and say no.

You're not selfish.

You're not a narcissist.

You're finally standing up for yourself.

So ignore what other people are accusing you of.

You're going to need help to work through the guilt and the false accusations that you receive.

Then pull back from relationships with people who just want to use you.

People who are selfish, self-centered, who don't take your needs into account.

People who are selfish, self-centered, who don't take your needs into account.

Avoid relationships that you realize are becoming just one-sided.

You're doing all the giving and you're never receiving.

Find a way to get out of relationships where you feel trapped.

That yes, I got married to somebody, but it's totally one-sided.

They're not willing to change.

Find a way to get out of that.

Practice confronting people.

Asserting yourself instead of constantly just accommodating.

And so that means learning to express your anger appropriately.

Learning to express right away that you're not comfortable, that you're upset, that you feel used, that you're hurt.

Do all of that right away.

And that's going to take a while to learn to do that.

But practice learning to do that.

But then stop your tendencies.

Stop your tendency to rationalize accommodating people, people-pleasing, avoiding getting people angry with you.

Stop telling yourself that it doesn't matter, that you're just being kind and loving.

Start looking more accurately at what really is happening and get away from those self-delusional lies.

Some people find it helpful to review all their past relationships and begin to see their pattern of choosing either controlling or needy partners.

From looking back at your past relationships, start noticing and writing down the danger signals that you should have seen and avoided.

So that now you can see them in potential partners, in potential relationships, and avoid them.

So start looking for signs of selfishness.

Signs of narcissism.

Signs of irresponsibility.

Signs of over-dependence.

All of those are going to generate a high sense of chemistry.

Oh, this person feels right.

It feels good.

But actually, it's because it resonates with an old, unhealthy template.

And so identify the warning signs so that you can avoid just following the oxytocin chemistry feeling.

So the bottom line is when you find a partner, begin to express your needs and opinions right up front in the relationship.

You want to, right from day one, make sure your needs matter just as much as their needs.

Your opinions and your values need equal consideration to their opinions and their values.

And if you begin to see that this relationship is not a 50-50 of equals, in meeting needs and respecting each other's opinions and values, then time to get out.

But if you find this person does respect you, there is an equal giving and taking, be willing to give the relationship a chance.

Don't sabotage it like you might have done in the past.

So I hope you realize that this people-pleasing life trap is a real one.

A really, really big one.

It is so tricky.

It is one that is very hard for people to face because of all the validation they get for it.

But man, it is destroying and hurting you and those you love the most.

And so I hope this just helps you get honest with yourself about it, get tools to learn how to begin to change it so that you can have healthy, intimate relationships.

That's what leads to true joy.

It's not validation for being a people-pleaser.

It's true connection with those that you love the most because of a healthy relationship.
