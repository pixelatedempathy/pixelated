Without them, jealousy kicks in, and they get really cruel when jealousy kicks in, and their control issues go up a notch.

Extreme sensitivity and a tendency to be easily hurt, to feel rejected over the slightest little things.

So if you're with a healthy person, it takes a lot to really make them feel hurt by something that you might do.

A narcissist, they feel hurt when you've hardly done anything.

Because they pick up hurt easily because of all of their shame issues.

But they're not.

But then as soon as they feel hurt, guess whose fault it is?

It's not their issues, it's yours, and they think you're just selfish.

Okay?

And then they need a mirror.

They need that constant reflection.

Now let me just say this.

So that's the 18 characteristics.

If you had all 18 of them, you need to talk to me afterwards and go to react.

I'm not here to beat up narcissists.

Because what happens, what kind of environment creates a narcissist?

Severe trauma.

Specifically, severe narcissists come out of homes where one of the parents was a severe narcissist.

Who belittled them and abused them and put them down and was cruel to them nonstop.

And the only way the child could survive was to become a narcissist.

And so it is an extreme response to extreme cruel treatment.

And that is the birthplace of narcissists.

Okay, let me end with this.

So those are the 18 characteristics.

Now there's three different types of narcissists.

Okay?

So number one is the one we normally think of, which is an exhibitionist narcissist.

So that's the person who's outgoing and is always talking about how wonderful they are, their great dreams, their great accomplishments, and letting you know how wonderful they are.

We're all familiar with that.

With the exhibitionist arsonist, what they also do is they put everybody else down a little bit.

Or a lot.

So they build themselves up, put everybody else down.

Positive to themselves, negative about everybody else.

Okay?

The next one is called a toxic or a malignant narcissist.

And that goes a step further.

So they put themselves up, puts others down.

But here's the next part.

They're sadistic.

They feel alive when they cause pain to other people.

They love being cruel and hurting people.

It's the bully that just keeps a kid and treats them cruelly every time and just thrives.

And just thrives off of causing pain to other people.

That's the exhibitionist arsonist.

That's the toxic narcissist.

Now it goes a little bit further.

The toxic narcissist loves to create chaos.

So they go into a situation and they go, this is way too boring and way too normal and healthy.

Let me see if I can just stir it up a bit and get everybody mad at everybody and everybody stressed out and I'll sit back and enjoy the show.

That's a toxic narcissist.

Final one.

The covert narcissist.

And that is the person you don't even think is a narcissist because they're so quiet.

They never put themselves out there.

They're shy.

They seem depressed and they seem to hate themselves.

And you go, how could that be a narcissist?

That's the co-narcissist.

So here's what I want you to see.

Do you realize that what the co-narcissist is doing is saying, please make everything all about me.

If I love you enough and sacrifice for you enough, will you make your world about me for a little bit?

And so they give and give and give, hoping to someday be the center of your universe.

That is the covert narcissist.

Or they say to a narcissist, an exhibitionist, narcissist, not a narcissist, can I hang around with you like the moon and will you just reflect your greatness off of me and let me enjoy it?

That's the covert narcissist.

They're still giving to getting.

They're still giving to getting.

They're still narcissistic.

You just don't see it until they're in a relationship for a long time.

I want to have a relationship with God.

It really gets in the way of having that relationship with God.

And so what I said is that when I deal with people coming out of addiction and complex trauma, probably 25% of the people I deal with have got what we call spiritual abuse.

And that is that someplace in their life, they were made to feel that God was not safe.

God was a dangerous God.

And that people who represented Him weren't safe either.

And so that is a huge issue for some people that is very hard to get over because of some of the stuff that they get told.

So I said I wanted to talk about some of the common distortions that people have.

So last week we talked about, we talked about God's anger and a lot of the distortions that have really messed up a lot of people and said, I don't want any relationship with this God.

Tonight I want to talk about maybe one of the hardest to explain things and I hope I can do a decent job.

I'm going to illustrate it next week just so that hopefully it just helps it make sense a little bit better.

But it's, if you go to churches, you don't have to go very long.

You don't have to go very long before you hear God's in control.

Okay?

And then you hear God's King, God's sovereign.

And so that phrase gets thrown around a lot within the Christian world.

But what concerns me is that there's been a lot of sloppy thinking about that.

And it has turned a lot of people off of God.

So let me explain some of that sloppy thinking.

So the first one is this.

I had people come to me, clients, and say, if God's in control, why didn't he stop my uncle from sexually abusing me?

If he loves me like he says he does and he's king and he's sovereign in control, he could have stopped it.

So the fact that he didn't stop it, he's either an unloving God or he really isn't in control.

And so they then go, I don't want a God that was in control.

Supposedly, and didn't stop bad things from happening.

And then they hear it through the ears that go, are you saying to me that it was God's will that I got sexually abused?

Are you saying to me that it's God's will that these children in war-torn countries get slaughtered in a genocide?

How can that be God's will?

So you can begin to realize that if you stop and think about God is in control, all of a sudden you go, whoa, what does that really mean?

Because if it means what some people are saying it means, then I don't want anything to do with that kind of a God.

And so then some people say, God's in control, so I'm just going to sit on my couch and wait for somebody to phone me and offer me a job.

It's like I can be either a puppet on a string or I don't have to do anything God will do every single day.

I can do everything for me.

So that's another area of sloppy thinking.

So I want to try to help you think about that.

And again, it's one of those topics in the Bible that we are given some answers to, but there's still an element that we can't quite get our brains around.

There's still a mystery element to it.

So that's what I want you to understand up front is even after I'm done explaining, if I do a perfect job, there's still a part of you that's going to say my brain hurts because I can't quite get that figured out.

Okay, so let me tackle this whole topic.

When we talk about God being in control and whether we have free will or not, let me give it to you this way.

If God was creating us and wanted a relationship with us, do you realize that God could have said, I know how to get them all to love me and do what I want and to spend time with me?

I'll make them robots.

I will give them no free will.

I will program them to show me love and to show me kindness.

But do you realize that when a robot shows you loving actions, it doesn't feel loving because it's a robot.

So love only is meaningful if it comes from God.

If it comes from free will, where it comes from a place where I could love a whole bunch of other things, but I choose to love you.

So the only way that a meaningful relationship with God could happen is if he gave us free will and a whole bunch of options of other things we could love.

And then in that environment, we looked at all those options and say, you're more beautiful than all of them.

I choose you.

Then that is meaningful love.

Okay, now think about that in the terms of complex trauma or gang activity.

I ask clients this all the time.

What is the best way to get your child to obey you?

Scare them to death.

Put the fear of God in them.

Make them afraid to disobey you.

Do you realize that fear of disaster is the best motivator to get people to do what you want?

That's what happens in the gang fight.

That's what happens in the gang world.

That's what happens in the street level world.

Is people obey the gang leader because they're afraid of not obeying the gang leader.

So it's obedience based on fear.

It's love, what looks like love based on fear.

But do you realize that's not true love?

So what I say to clients all the time, the best way to motivate children in the long run is not fear.

Because after a while, they'll rebel if you use fear.

The best way in the long run is to just love them.

And you go, that's no guarantee they're going to obey me right away.

But once they know they're fully loved and they live within that love, then they want to obey you.

Not to earn, not to avoid getting punished, but to give back the overflow of the love that you've poured into them.

So love becomes the basis to produce love in somebody else that you give free will for.

Fear does not produce genuine love in somebody else.

And so God said, I'm going to create a world where love will be the most important thing.

Now let me take that a little bit further.

Do you realize that the greatest pleasure in life comes from a love connection?

The problem with complex trauma is you didn't get that growing up.

So you've never experienced the highest pleasure that is humanly possible to enjoy.

So that's why drugs and alcohol become so attractive because they give a pleasure that is close to that, but not quite as great as that.

And you just keep going back to that because it makes you get all of the feelings that love was supposed to get and connection was supposed to get.

And so what God is saying is, I want to create a universe where love is the dominant thing, because then as people connect with each other and with me in deep, honest intimacy and love, they will enjoy the highest pleasure possible.

I want people to have my happiness, my joy, is what he is saying.

And to do that, I have to give them free will.

Okay, so you follow all that so far, I hope.

So then it goes further.

How does God act as the king of a universe, of a galaxy, of this whole big thing that we call our planet Earth?

God rules by what we call a first cause, primary cause, or secondary cause.

So a primary cause is when God does something directly.

So he created directly, okay?

He turned water into wine directly.

He was actively involved in the immediate behavior which produced the immediate result, okay?

That's the first cause.

So God created the world, and he's following some big plan that we don't fully understand, but that's the first primary cause.

Secondary cause is within the world, God gave two other forces.

Number one, us, with free will.

So you can go home and smack your kid.

Nobody can stop you, okay?

And then the second type of secondary cause is natural laws.

Gravity is there.

The weather, all of the different tides and currents in the ocean are all part of that.

Bacteria and viruses, they create all kinds of things.

So they are things that cause other things.

So now just stick with me and I'll explain it.

So let's say a person is on a roof and they slip and they fall, and they fall down.

And they fall 20 stories and they fall to their death.

Now do you say God did that?

No, God was not the primary cause of that person slipping.

Gravity did that.

And we acknowledge that there's a secondary cause in the world that God initially put in place, but God's not walking around saying, if you slip, I'll catch you and I'll overcome gravity.

He lets the secondary cause happen.

So somebody sneezes on you and you get sick.

Did God make you sick?

No, a virus made you sick.

So that is kind of how all of that happens.

Now let me take it a little bit further.

What God did when he created the world and put all these secondary causes in place is he says, I acted as a primary cause to create this.

Now I will sit on my hands and let these other causes secondary causes carry on.

Okay, so I'm not going to stop global warming.

I'm not going to stop glaciers melting.

I'm not going to stop hurricanes from happening.

All of that is going to happen as people make decisions, as weather follows its patterns.

I'm going to let all of that happen.

I will not interfere with the secondary causes that I have put into place.

Okay, now let me just take a little side note here.

How many of you have gone looking for a parking spot downtown and you say, God, please give me a parking spot and you go around and there's a parking spot and you go, it's a miracle.

It's not a miracle.

Somebody just moved out.

A miracle by definition is when God interferes with the secondary causes and interrupts them.

So he turns white.

So he turns water into wine.

That would not happen by the secondary causes.

It only would happen if God reasserted a primary cause force in the world.

Okay, so a lot of the things that we call miracles are just the result of secondary causes.

They're not technically miracles.

Okay, that's my little rant for that.

Okay, so let me take that further and this is where it gets painful.

Okay, so God said, I will put secondary forces.

I will sit on my hands and not interfere.

So people can abuse this world and there will be droughts and there will be hurricanes and global warming and all of that, I will not interfere.

You'll get a Hitler and he's going to come along and he's going to want to rule the world.

I'm not going to interfere.

Even though six million Jews and all kinds of other people are going to get killed, I will not interfere.

A father's going to sexually abuse his daughter.

I will not interfere.

I will let that happen and the consequences of that happen.

Because you see, if God said, I will interfere every time something bad is about to happen, then he takes away free will.

And then he takes away the consequences and he becomes codependent.

And he says, you can do all the bad you want.

I just won't let any bad things happen.

God says, no, in order for this to work, I have to sit on my hands and not interfere with the secondary causes.

Now, it doesn't stop there.

Because if it stopped there, you'd go, that is, I don't like that.

You want to know what God said?

Is, you know what?

I'm not going to wait for you to love me.

I created the world.

I created secondary causes.

I made it possible for people to use their human words, their human will, in a harmful way and hurt other people.

And I'm not going to interfere.

But here's what I'll do.

I will come and I will come on this planet as a human being.

I will love you and come beside you.

I will experience all the secondary causes and the abuse that they have.

I will go through illegal trial.

I will go through torture.

I will go through every pain at a deeper level than anybody else has ever experienced.

I will go through it all out of love for you.

And then when you go through it, I will come beside you and say, I get your pain.

And I will be able to comfort you and help you in your pain.

So you will experience my love, not from a distant God, but from a God who's gone through the same things you did, who understands, who cares, and who comforts you there.

But then it doesn't stop there.

He then says, I will take that bad that that person did.

And in a way you'll never be able to understand.

I will somehow bring a positive out of it.

And that's Romans 8, 28, where God says, I will take everything that happens to those who love me, everything good, everything ugly, everything wrong and bad, and I will turn it into a positive thing in their life to make them a better person if they cooperate with me.

So I will not let that negative stuff that other people perpetrated on you, I will not let it keep you in a place of negative.

If you surrender to me, I will turn it into a growth thing and into a positive.

And that's the story that I want to tell you next week.

But what I want you to hear tonight is this.

How does God rule the world?

Not through coercive force, but through love.

And it's not just love from a distance and say love me, love me like a narcissist.

No, it's God saying, let me first love you greater than you ever will be able to love me.

And let me do that by making the greatest sacrifice imaginable from moving from being God infinite to a human being.

You know what that would be like?

That would be like you one day saying, I think I'm going to spend the rest of my life as a mosquito because I want to help these mosquitoes.

They are vicious creatures, especially in Manitoba.

And they need a lot of work on them to become nicer creatures.

So the only way I can do that is to become a mosquito myself.

You can sign up over there if you're interested.

You're going, what?

There's not a hope I'm going to be a mosquito.

But God said, I'm going to become a human.

And for the first time in my life, I'm not going to stay up forever.

I got to have a sleep.

For the first time, I got to eat, and I'm going to get hungry, and I'm going to get tired.

Boy, that's going to be hard being that little wee human being.

And I can only run about 10 miles an hour, and I can only walk so many miles a day.

And I can only talk to one person at a time.

And when I was a God in heaven, I could talk to everybody all at once.

It was not a problem.

Wow, that's a restriction and a limitation that is super hard.

But I'm not going to stop there.

I'm going to go through every single type of hurt and pain that they've gone through.

I'll get abandoned.

I'll get rejected.

I'll get forgotten about.

I'll get abused.

I will get injustice.

I'll go through it all at the worst possible level because now I understand their pain.

And now when they're in pain, I can meet them not out of coercive force but of love.

And that is how God rules the world.
