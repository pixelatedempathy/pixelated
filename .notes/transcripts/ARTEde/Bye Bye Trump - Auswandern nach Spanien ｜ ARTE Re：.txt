I'm looking for a van. Wait here. Taxis. There's a taxi. This way. Chris Kelly and her daughter Theresa from California have just landed in Barcelona. Seven bags. Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven. My whole life. I'm nervous about school and because I'm in Spain now. Although I can hardly speak Spanish. Get in. Watch your head. Where are you from? San Diego. San Diego. You either say that you're from Canada. We're from Canada. Because the Europeans are very critical of the situation in America right now. Spanish food is definitely better. What did he say? He said that Spanish food is a lot better. Oh. So good. So good. It is fine. We're in England. Chris was fighting a corporate war here for our future. When he was martyred in the vive in 코로나, welcome home wonderful wow i wanted to go away when trump won 2016 but i couldn't afford it financially as a single mother i'm doing the good training and safety of my daughter the most before the last election my daughter and i thought about what we would do if he wins because they don't feel well in this new america they wanted to pull away that's why they contacted barbara a french expert specialist in barcelona she discovered these three-room apartments in the city center for you barbara was the jackpot for me alone i would never have thought about it where is the switch the room is so cute that is her first own room this is my bathroom where is mine in san diego chris had a beauty salon because of the inflation and the real estate crisis it was financially impossible for her daughter to have her own room we had a storage room in the living room in order to rent such an apartment in san diego costs 3500 to 4000 dollars rent in barcelona they now pay 2000 euros per month thanks to savings and their pension chris hopes that it will be better for them financially one bread cost six dollars i'm not even talking about meat and other expensive products a loaf of bread the same applies to real estate prices trump promised his voters to make sure they would sink but now he's doing the opposite he has no problem treating people like idiots because idiots brought him to power before the sun is all gone the terrace and the family i would say that today two to three times as many americans contact me as before since the election of donald trump many feel foreign to the usa that has to do with how he deals with human rights and how he wants to rule since november 5, 2024 the day of the re-election of donald trump the american society is acting as split as never before inquiries on the subject of immigration in search engines have risen by 1500 percent that is, through trump there would be a wave of immigration that began during his first term of office from 2016 the number of immigrants who have been living in the netherlands has increased from 15,000 to 24,000 in portugal that is 15,000 three times as much as before applications for spanish visas have increased by 70 percent in nine years with 41,000 americans spain is clearly a preferred immigration country not only among the elites or students today middle-class families single mothers and academics also settle here in the united states the most important thing is that the immigration system is in place and that the immigration system is in place and that the immigration system is in place and that the immigration system is in place and that the immigration system is in place the most important thing here is the jogo mark zealand the whisk 你 moto mark zealand If all these Americans are really welcome in spain at the moment, the newcomers do not ask counterfeit money over here for the people of spain here the quality of life here gives priority to a앟 It's more about the time with family and friends and less about the career. In the USA, it is said, the working culture is above all. Here I am much more relaxed. Sir Peter Bibian is 45 and belongs to the American diaspora in Spain. She has been living here for 10 years now, currently in Malaga. I'm going to stay here. Okay. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye. How are you? Hello, sweethearts. Are you happy to see me? I didn't expect that when I moved to Spain. I'm so happy. Just look at the view here. The Mediterranean. I grew up in the suburbs, in a very typical American neighborhood. But it was definitely not nice there. It's completely different here. This is really far from home. In East Texas, Seppi worked in a personnel department. She no longer has an office day job here, because she is an influencer and coaches emigrants. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. Hello. From the 19 European countries she recommends, Spain is the most popular. Spain has got a different visa for digital nomads, for people who are no-visa, for the retired visa, and for their student visa. Okay, last. Her online offers are now in high demand. Four days of intensive coaching plus description of all possibilities are making a 100-dollar trip to Europe. Generally in our masterclasses we had 90 to 100 participants. But one week after Trump's election, there were suddenly 664 results. I was shocked. We had 664 in the masterclass. I mean, I wasn't naive when I thought that if Trump's week would increase some interest in the election, it would boost some interest in the election. But I did not foresee it at this level. At the beginning, Seppi only wanted to share her own experiences. As a woman who addresses other women above all. Since I moved to Madrid, I have met so many women who have left the USA. I thought it would be cool if we, who are already here, help others who still want to come. But I had no activist or political ambitions with this project. They were not even a topic of conversation. I thought it would be cool if we could talk about it. Every week she offers online meetings for women who are preparing for their life change. Let me let everyone in. Hey ladies, welcome. Hi Gigi. Hi everybody. Hi, nice to see you. First let's do a little question. I think I want to share anything exciting that has happened recently. I came from Lisbon. I am currently on a research trip. Hopefully I will have a better idea of what direction I want to go and what visa I should apply for. I have the choice between Spain and Germany. But I tend to go to Spain. Great. I thought only Germany would be on the list. What a surprise that Spain is also on the list. But behind the smile there is real stress. Because the women are confronted with an America that has become alien to them. I live in Florida, the highland of the Republicans. Here you feel like you are at a meeting of Trump supporters. I can't go anywhere else. They are everywhere. You constantly encounter hatred and anger, accusations of immigrants and corrupt judges. I don't want to be emotional. I want to be a woman. I don't want to be emotional. But it is absolutely terrible. It's something that I think about on repeat on most days. I don't feel peace anymore. And now I think I am really just being a character, more in terms of the human piece, but it's physical peace. I am a university student at the University of Africa about diversity, equality and inclusion. My university had a diversity program a month ago. That's terrible because it brings together life and work. You wonder how long you can endure it without getting sick. That's why it's time for me to protect myself and change my life. Thank you so much for sharing, Andrea. It really does hurt to hear what you are going through here. I am reading the news, but everyone is talking about it. I am reading the news, but everyone is talking about it. I am reading the news, but everyone is talking about it. I am reading the news, but everyone is talking about it. Here in Spain, I can't really experience how it is for you every day. All the fear, the discomfort and the uncertainty I read about become absolutely real through you. This makes my work even more meaningful. It's not just about traveling and living in another country. You can see that safety is now a big topic. I have mixed feelings. I wish the choice was different. I wish the choice was different. I wish the choice was different. I am here living my best life, but not only the customers, but also my family and friends in the USA have to experience this new America. Ciao! Thank you, everyone! Bye! Like 15,000 other Americans, Vanessa moved to Madrid. She is a lesbian and lives in Texas. Her sexual identity played a key role in her decision. Being gay in Texas is a gamble. The rise in trans violence, trans and human-based violence, has to do with the election. Because a lot of people have felt emboldened. And I had to take that. I wanted to leave because my rights under the current government are in danger. coming after my rights. What have I packed in again? After two months of living in Madrid, she moved into this 15 square meter apartment. It is actually a studio in the attic. This is going to be my living room. And then I have this with Enif in front of me. I had to take everything with me, so I really just had to take everything with me. So I took what was important to me, essentially. So I felt a lot of sadness. It wasn't just the things that I had left behind. I felt a lot of sadness. I was just like, I don't know what to do. I didn't feel sad, but I felt like I had to leave this space that I had so many memories with. Vanessa's family comes from Colombia. When I make bigger dishes, I have to play this music. Then my Colombian ancestors are there and tell me how to dose the ingredients. You need to pour more sauce. You need to pour more stuff in there. It's done. It's good. I make caramel dishes. She chose her new home because of her Spanish. I didn't always grow up, you know, speaking Spanish. When I was little, we spoke Spanish at home. And I wanted to study Spanish at university. So this is like the home of my family. This is like a standard breakfast in Colombia at a place where everybody makes. They eat that at a place for dinner. I guess I'll probably have to go get another table. Vanessa's parents came to the USA in the 1970s. I asked my mom to take a picture of her. It was on her bedside table. This is my dad. Her deceased father came illegally across the border. He too was looking for the American dream. Fifty years later, she's moving to another continent. Her American passport makes that possible. It's crazy to think about my father and how he got into the country. He didn't have a cell phone and no access to all the amenities like I do today. So that reminds me that you have to keep going. You never know how hard and how difficult it is emotionally, physically, mentally to move through. You can't do it through persevering. Come on. I didn't know I forgot that I had one. Look, I'm blonde. It's mind-blowing. But yeah, I think it's very ironic. Because my parents moved to the USA to have a better life. And I'm here doing that. And I'm here doing that. But I have to go to Europe to have a better life. Vanessa belongs to the few in her family who voted for the Democrats. Hi! How are you? How are you? You saw my piles. You saw my piles? Yeah, I see. Yeah, I see. Her mother belongs to the Latin Americans who support Donald Trump despite his immigration-ridden attitude. We didn't get any handouts. We didn't get any handouts. We were given free work and hard work for what we are. So many people come here and try to get everything for free. They don't even want to work. And that's why a lot of people are saying, it's enough. And that's why a lot of people are saying, I don't even know. Because you never know what's going to happen tomorrow. It's kind of all going to shit. A little bit. All right. I love you. Thanks, Mom. I really appreciate it. Bye. Bye. It's always kind of weird. You know, we have different views. She's really uncomfortable talking about politics. My mom and I have really been doing well. So yeah, I think that it's always going to be a bit of a mess, and it is with many members of my family. Uncle and aunts openly make homophobic and racist remarks. In Spain, Vanessa broke off contact with them. We have a family group chat. We're a group of 40 people out there, which is insane. You know, I went off because there were certain things that were said that I was just like, it's not okay to say these things. It was very isolated to me. The people who I thought would say, and please just do it, but I'm not going to say it. But I think that's what it's like. But I think that's what it's like. And I think it's just a matter of, you know, I'm not going to say it. I'm not choosing to be lesbian, I'm not choosing to be a woman. I am. I am. I'm not pushing away. That's a quite negative attitude I think, not the way I usually them. With her single one, she's had everything in us. But she's had things in her mind, you know, she's not in some form of treatment. It is. Being Kokama. Yeah. two adult children who are in Seattle. I'm concerned about what's happening because, you know, I see a lot of children that live there. The longer I'm there, the more I can distance myself from the news. But I think it's so outrageous. I can't ignore the news. It's completely not. It's almost like a... What's the next plot twist? Teresa gets a visa for Spain because she wants to go to school there. Today she's visiting her new high school. You'll get on the bus and you'll figure that out. Can't lose that. You just 10 rides on it. The 17-year-old has never driven alone with public transport. In San Diego, her mother drove her to school in the morning and picked her up in the evening. The fact that tomorrow I'm going to have her go to school by bus for the first time, that first said, I'm going to go to school, and it's a little bit frightening, but I don't think anybody would even consider in the States. I think it's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. It's here. What's that line that shows everything every where? They're teaching theory. When I was in the army for a year. In one week. 10pen. We go to opt the world for here. 9 pen. How. Hello. Hello. What's going on? Where am I my little part of that. It's really far away. Minimalist. Tireless time off. So that's your because your parents? Nothing else. ." There's a problem here? Yeah, I'm going to be starting on Monday. So, 11th of May. Freak out? No, it's okay. Theresa is looking forward to her new class. Without all the violence she experienced in San Diego in the last few school years. In the US, the gates are locked. At my old school, at least three armed police officers were patrolling the hall. Our police officers walking around. We had no warning to the students there freshman year. We went into a little lockdown and police were like, the parents were notified and it was crazy. I mean, I just got emotional. It scares that I would have to sing my daughter a song and not have her come out. And not have her come out. There's a reason why the doors are not locked. It's a reason why the police officers are not there. There are no armed police officers. And that's because we don't need it here. We don't need them here. At first, they can't understand that. But soon enough, they will see that the old situation was not normal. Many American parents choose to go into exile because they want to escape the school system that is in the Trump administration's crossroads. Yes, we have a lot of families that were sent to school in September. A lot of them contacted me after Trump's re-election. And they were afraid. They contacted me and asked if they could come earlier. The number of families coming from the USA has increased by 40%. But we just had a lot of students this school year. How lucky do you feel? Pretty lucky. The streets are very different from San Diego. Yes, they are much wider. Stopping for? Yes, they are. Mother and daughter enjoy just strolling through the streets of Barcelona. Come, I'll take a picture. That's the Arc de Triomphe. But why is it here and not in Paris? Here I was somehow burdened by the shoulders. So I gradually gain more distance from what happened last night. Temps and feels. Jade of a Thanks a lot. When was the last time it rained heavily? How long ago? It's a long time ago. Has it stopped? Yes. I live here, but back then I was in France and watched Spanish TV, that it rained for 20 days. The last few months she is constantly on the plane. This weekend she has a meeting in Madrid. Hello friends! Hi, how are you? How nice! You have chosen a great neighborhood. And the next one is also nice. Helen and Lee come from New York and meet with Seppi, so she can give them tips on life in Madrid. Here you can drink wine well. A small wine bar. On this street there are international food stores. Are you buying furniture for the apartment? Exciting! Yes, it is part of it, when you move internationally. Everything has started here. This street and this apartment are special to me. Here I lived alone for the first time. Seppi says she loves her work even after 10 years. But the situation in the USA is always more and more stressful. Sometimes I just want to focus on the positive and not talk about politics. Even with people who are my opinion, it is depressing. The idea of ​​the American dream and a democratic America is slowly falling. That everything changes so quickly makes me so sad. I get emotional. You make me emotional. You can hardly process that in real time. It's really shocking to see how quickly everything changes. We just happened to move at the right time. I definitely don't return to the USA. But I still feel American. Whether it's my entrepreneurial spirit, my optimism or my smile. That's just the way we are. Ah, Sharon! Oh my God! The most beautiful moments for her are the personal encounters with women she has coached online. Come on, Sharon! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! Come on, come on! You're a drinky dream. On this evening, 25 women follow her invitation. Stop it! I could cry. You're so cute! You're so small! Oh my God! Everybody says, I thought you were bigger. After several months of coaching, Casey Forbes leaves Florida and dares a new start in Madrid. I started off wanting to live in Germany. I had thought about Germany, the Netherlands, Italy or Portugal. But I couldn't decide. Seppi helped me gain clarity. That was important because it's not a temporary farewell. It's about a life that is changed by this decision. This is a life changing moment, you know, to help me. This big, huge, kind of daunting, but scary, farewell. Seppi herself is a kind of a master connector. Okay, we're going to sit down. Take a seat. Okay, good. Everyone's so quick. Okay, we're co-hosts up in the air. Hello everybody. So my name is Seppi, right? I say. So that was an event about creating a space where we would like to meet and make new friends. And tonight, very virtual, we're celebrating. Yeah, I'm celebrating your journey as well, but I want you to talk about how far you've come in your journey with our journey.歐 I know. And you know, I mean, the thing that caught my interest was the sentences I said in the van when you crashed into your dog, but I wanted, you know, you know, I have funny friends and I thought. It was funny and it was fun for me to experience what it's like to be breathing again after a long and tough journey to belly. What happens the next month? Don't say it like that. Chris wants to learn Spanish as quickly as possible with Teresa's help in Barcelona. Vanessa continues her exploration of Madrid three months after arriving with nine friends. Next year she will continue her psychology studies and then file an application for Spanish citizenship in two years. Thanks to her Colombian roots, this is not a problem. 1,200 st �何
