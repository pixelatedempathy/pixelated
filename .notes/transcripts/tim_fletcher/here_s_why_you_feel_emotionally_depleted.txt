I want to take a common topic and just go a bit deeper on it today and it's self-care.

And self-care is a topic that has become very popular for people to talk about but I find that for much of the discussion that I see that takes place around self-care is that a lot of people end up only doing what I would call partial self-care.

They're taking care of parts of themselves but not all of themselves.

Secondly, I find that a lot of people they just know they're tired but they don't know why.

So they just know oh I need some self-care but they don't know what's caused them to become so depleted.

So there's a lack of awareness about what depletes us.

And so what people then do is oh I'm so tired.

I just need to rest physically.

And that might not be exactly what they need.

They might need a self-care that goes beyond just physical rest.

And so I really want to dig into this because what I find is for a lot of people they see some of the current teaching that might kind of just be that more superficial you just need to go have a day at the spa and they just think that's going to fix all their problems.

And they don't have a full enough understanding of what true self-care is.

And they don't understand at a conscious level all the things that bring about us feeling depleted.

I think for anybody in recovery they know that when they're depleted of energy it's a dangerous time for them.

So if they're depleted physically they're exhausted or they're depleted emotionally or they're depleted in their life.

Or they're death by body badly or they take risks in life.

They're compensating through detailed psychology around君 harder research on micro effects and their relattendance.

They're really tugging on why didn't I get to the處 knew let me feel better.

So, the question is who will you decompress and what happens if you don't ??

For the most part they'll try to slow down their water temperature and won't take that Rejuvenator.

They go into recovery after years of basically dissociating.

So they've suppressed all their emotions.

They've lived like robots.

They just do what needs to be done.

They don't feel much.

They're not aware of what's going on inside of them.

It's just all about productivity and doing stuff.

Lack of self-awareness.

Everything is just operating out of this self-conscious world.

And so they're disconnected from emotions, even from bodily sensations.

They just push themselves through life.

What they don't realize is as they're going through life, all of that stuff, they're not conscious of it, but their subconscious brain is conscious of it.

And their subconscious brain is going, too much stress here, too much anxiety, too much depression, too much tiredness.

I'm right.

I'm running out of gas.

I'm running out of gas.

I better go to fight, flight, or freeze.

And their subconscious brain is starting to think of fight, flight, freeze.

And the person is not even conscious that that's what their subconscious brain is planning.

And so all of a sudden, they find themselves sliding back into old behaviors.

Now they're eating too much.

They're sleeping too much.

They're avoiding things.

They're procrastinating.

And it's just starting to happen.

And they don't know why because they've been disconnected from all of that.

And if they keep giving into that and letting those old behaviors continue, pretty soon they're going to be in an even darker place.

Pretty soon they're going to be even more depleted.

And so it's super dangerous for them.

But then what happens to many people when they find a clue in, okay, I'm overeating again and doing all of my old behaviors here.

What's going on?

Oh, I must be depleted.

All I need is a day at night.

I need to go to the spa.

That'll fix everything.

I just need self-care.

And they go for a day at the spa and it doesn't help a whole lot.

It helps a little bit, but it doesn't help a whole lot.

That's what I want us to understand.

So we need self-awareness around when we're depleted, the things that deplete us.

But we also need self-awareness around, my meeting consistently my 12 needs.

Because if I'm not, I'm going to become depleted.

Those are so crucial.

So let me develop what depletes us.

And there's been some amazing research done around this that I find quite fascinating.

And so I'm going to share it with you.

So we all most readily think of being depleted, tired, exhausted, because of physical.

Labor because of physical work about doing too much.

I'm just exhausted.

So when we think of depletion, we tend to think of it in physical activity terms.

Let me develop that.

And it's partly right, but there's a whole bunch more things other than physical that deplete us.

And that's where we're going to get to.

But let me give you a bigger context here.

Any time, so we've got our sympathetic nervous system, which is our activity and our parasympathetic nervous system, which is our rest.

They need to be in balance if we are going to keep our gas tanks full, to stay healthy, not burnout.

So if my sympathetic nervous system is going too much, and my parasympathetic nervous system is not allowed to bring in rest, and healing, and rejuvenation, I eventually am going to become depleted.

And so for people from complex trauma, this is why we become depleted so easily, because we're used to being in our sympathetic nervous system all the time, because we are in survival mode.

And so it's easy to slide back into that.

That's been the default setting for years.

And so big picture, what we're looking at with depletion is, learning when I'm in my sympathetic nervous system, when I'm back in survival mode type of stuff, and not in my parasympathetic in the right balance.

That is the big picture of what we're looking at.

Now let me just say this.

When we go into our sympathetic nervous system, it actually for many people feels good, because we get an adrenaline rush.

We get more energy.

We feel more alive.

We don't feel depleted.

And so we go, this is a good thing.

But what you don't realize is, if you don't get to the parasympathetic in the right balance, being in your sympathetic too much feels good for now, but it's slowly taking its toll, and using up gas that you're not replenishing.

And pretty soon you're going to burn out.

You're going to be depleted.

So I'm going to give you some of the physical, physical things that they're finding.

So besides just overworking, over go, go, go all the time, not getting enough sleep.

What they're finding is a person who loves multitasking.

And so they're always wanting to multitask.

That takes a lot of energy.

And so it can deplete us more quickly than a person who just does one thing at a time.

Another thing they're finding is people that live, in cluttered, messy spaces, without realizing that's actually depleting them.

That's taking energy out of them just to live in that space.

Another one is being cooped up inside, all alone.

So you don't go out, you don't connect, you don't interact with people, you don't do anything social, you just stay cooped up.

That takes a lot of energy.

Other ones, not drinking enough water, so dehydration.

Another one, people who live with chronic physical pain.

So just living with pain takes a ton of energy.

So those people get depleted.

People that are fighting a sickness, an infection, a virus, get depleted because it takes a lot of energy to fight those things.

People recovering from surgery, where their body's doing a ton of healing physically, are very tired.

And then, people who go through a major move, or a major change in life, job-wise, moving to a different city, a new relationship, a child moving away from home, a new baby, a ton of energy required.

And so they can become very depleted because of that.

So those are all physical things.

But what I want you to realize is that's only a small part of what depletes us.

One of the things that depletes us, probably more than anything, is emotions.

So let's talk about that.

Because for people from complex trauma who've suppressed emotions, disconnected from emotions, they don't realize how much energy emotions take.

And so what we find for many people who take our LIFT program, or REACT program, is after a couple weeks, they're just exhausted.

And they go, why?

I haven't been doing anything.

And they're still thinking in terms of physical activity is the only thing that makes you tired.

And I go, no, you're doing human's work when it comes to emotions right now.

And you're exhausted because of all the emotional work that you're doing.

And that's a new concept for them.

So, things that deplete us in the emotional world, and it's fascinating to me what they're finding out, is when you have stuff emotions all the time, so you've got anger coming up, you stuff it down.

You've got fear coming up, you stuff it down.

That's intense emotional stuff that you're stuffing.

If you go through loss, and you stuff it down.

It's like holding a beach ball under water.

It takes a lot of energy to stuff down an intense emotion.

And so you get to play.

And because of that.

Second one with that is every time you feel an intense emotion like anger, deep fear, huge amount of stress, hate, deep sense of injustice.

Those are intense, intense emotions and they all involve cortisol.

Any intense emotions that brings about cortisol, you'll be exhausted afterwards.

They take a ton of energy.

So just feeling and expressing very intense emotions requires a lot of energy.

Next one I've already kind of referred to and it's processing old wounds, old trauma that you've been suppressing for years, but now you're bringing it out and talking about it, processing it, crying about it, healing, feeling the emotions of it.

That's exhausting.

That is hard work and it is very depleting.

So if you're in a recovery program, expect to be tired.

Another one is if you're carrying an intense resentment towards somebody.

That takes a lot of energy.

Another one, if you have a conflict, an intense conflict with somebody, you can expect you're going to be exhausted afterwards because that intense conflict took a ton of energy.

Next one, if you're sitting in an intense emotion that can't quickly be resolved, so you've just lost somebody, you're grieving, you just don't magically make that go away.

You've got to sit in it.

Or if you're going through a time of change, so you're going to be going to a new job, going through a move, there's a lot of anxiety, and insecurity around that, living in the unknown that creates emotions you can't magically make it go away.

So you've got to sit in them.

Sitting in those emotions takes a lot out of you.

If you're in a dangerous place, so there's a war going on, you're sitting in intense emotions that you can't magically make disappear.

If you've got financial problems, you can't just make disappear.

Those take a lot out of you, the emotions that you have to sit in.

Another important one is when you are supporting somebody who's going through a very painful time.

So you're listening to them, you're feeling compassion to them, you're spending time with them, you're going to be exhausted.

Compassion fatigue is going to be there.

Another one is if you get triggered, an old wound, an old issue gets triggered, so you feel disrespected, you feel not heard, not seen, rejected, all of that, and you lash out.

You lose it.

You just fly off the handle, and you go on a rampage in your triggered, dysregulated state.

You're going to be exhausted afterwards.

Giving in to that trigger and going to your limbic brain and just letting it fuel a whole bunch of behaviors takes a lot of energy.

Another one they're finding is if you are constantly just negative, in a negative place in your head, criticizing everything, being negative about everything, complaining about everything in your life, it takes a lot of energy.

It depletes you.

And so part of that is because you're not giving your brain the good chemicals it needs, the serotonin, the dopamine, the oxytocin that it needs to feel good, to get energy, you're depriving it of that by just focusing on negative all the time, and it depletes you.

If you become involved in a cause, a very important cause, let's say climate-related, racial-related, inequality of the sexes-related, injustice at work, whatever, if you become in a cause that is passionate to you, it's going to stir up a lot of intense emotions, and that can be very draining, especially if you then spend time on social media, on the internet, researching the cause, listening to what other people say about the cause.

It keeps stirring up intense emotions, and that can be very draining.

If you are a perfectionist, or if you are a bit of a control freak, you just always want to control everything in everybody's life, that takes a lot of emotional energy.

It takes a lot of energy, and so there's going to be a depletion that can come out of that.

Now let me take this a little bit further into deeper complex trauma.

Most people that come out of complex trauma have what I call a default setting.

It's where their brain naturally just has become used to, and is their normal.

So that could be fear, that could be shame, that could be feeling guilt.

All of those just, that's the way they've lived.

All their childhood is feeling those emotions, and so now that's just their normal, their default setting.

So if you have a default setting, of shame, I'm not good enough, my life sucks, I'm not valuable, I'm not lovable, that's going to result in a default setting where you're always seeking validation maybe, or approval from others.

That's draining.

So what I want you to see is certain default settings take a lot of energy.

So some of the other default settings is always worrying about what people think.

So an insecurity, what do they think of me?

What do they think of my hair?

What do they think of my looks?

What do they think of how I just performed?

Takes a lot of energy.

If you have a false guilt, that's always been your default setting, you need to feel guilty to feel normal, that takes a lot of energy.

If you've always had an anger, and you need to feel angry to feel normal, that takes a lot of energy.

If you've got anxiety or negative thoughts, negativity that we talk about, that takes a lot of energy.

If that's your default setting and your brain just naturally keeps gravitating back to wanting to feel negative and anxious.

Some are always living by shoulds, unrealistic expectations for themselves.

I should be doing this, I should be doing that.

That takes a lot of energy if that's your default setting.

Perfectionism, controlling we've talked about.

If you are a person that your default setting is stuffing emotions, that's the first thing you do when you feel an emotion is want to stuff it and be stoic.

That takes a lot of energy.

If you have a default setting that doesn't want to feel emotions, so you just have distractions all the time, that takes a lot of energy.

So what I want you to see is when you look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about, a lot of those 60 characteristics can become a default setting for people from complex trauma and most of those characteristics, if you think about it, you realize, whoa, it takes a lot of energy to have that as my normal.

So it's important to begin to realize that people coming out of complex trauma, they have come to a place as their default setting that constantly is depleting.

So important to understand.

So that's just the emotional.

So let's go to the third depleting category and that's the intellectual.

What they've realized is, again, we have our conscious brain and our subconscious brain.

So our subconscious brain is working 95% of the time.

We're just in autopilot.

We're just doing all kinds of different things we're not even aware of.

That doesn't take tons of energy.

It's our conscious brain.

And so that's the intense cognitive processing.

So reading, thinking, analyzing, problem solving, doing calculations, memorizing, explaining stuff to people.

Where we ought to be in our conscious brain, that takes a lot of energy.

In fact, it takes about a third of our calories are in our conscious brain.

And so if you're in a day where you're just doing a lot of intense thinking, processing, calculating, teaching, and you're using a lot of calories, and so you're going to be tired afterwards.

Another intellectual depleting thing is obsessing.

Not being able to turn your brain off when you have a resentment or there's been an injustice or you are worried about something or involved in a new cause or you have an embarrassment that you just keep replaying in your mind or a new love in your life that you just become obsessed about.

And you go over and over and over in your mind.

That can be very draining.

And so it's people that don't have good intellectual internal boundaries that can stop thinking about things when it's time to stop thinking about them.

There's a fourth area where depletion happens and that's relationship stuff.

So let me give you those.

So if you're involved in a relationship and there's been a series of choices that have now involved in conflict, you're going to be depleted after all of that.

If you're coming out of a shame place where you're always trying to impress others, what are they thinking about me?

And so now you're wearing masks, you're switching and becoming what they want to be.

That takes a lot of energy.

If you're always telling lies and got to keep track of what lies you've been telling people, that takes a lot of energy.

If you're always fawning and people pleasing and giving what they want, that takes a lot of energy.

If you're constantly needing to be attuned to what everybody's feeling so that you can respond, that takes a lot of energy.

And so what they have found is people in relationships who are basically fawning takes a lot of energy.

If you are in a relationship and you have a child or a partner that's behaving badly, so let's say you're out in public and your child's crying and having a tantrum, or you're with friends and your partner's being inappropriate and you're trying to keep a smile on your face and act like it's not bothering you, you're suppressing all of that anger, embarrassment, that significant amount of energy being used to suppress all of that.

Another one that's really important to understand is if you are a very prejudiced individual, so let's say that certain races of people you just look down on, you don't like, well, you have somebody that moves around, moves into your neighborhood who's a different race than you, or you move to a different city where there's a lot more of those people, all of a sudden now you've got this internal stuff going on of frustration and anger all the time due to your racism, due to your prejudice.

And that takes a lot of energy.

I've already referred to it, but it's important to highlight again, people that are alone too much, who aren't experiencing secure attachment, aren't experiencing healthy relationship, they're going to be depleted.

Flip side of that, people who fall in love.

So all of a sudden I'm in love and now initially it seems to energize you, you got all kinds of energy, you want to do all kinds of things, you're fueled by oxytocin and adrenaline and dopamine and it feels so great, but it's taking a lot of energy out of you.

And it's going to take its toll.

The next one is, if you're in social settings where you're kind of the leader, where you're kind of the host, you have to be on your game, you have to be talking to everybody and making sure you've been in contact with everybody and everybody's okay, that takes a ton of energy.

Or if you're in a social setting but you're an introvert, and you have to kind of force yourself to talk to people and talk small talk and talk about stuff that doesn't really interest you, that can take a ton of energy too and be very depleting.

Another one is if you lose somebody close to you.

So again, it's the end of a relationship, could be death, could be divorce, separation, but it's grief.

And so you're going through those very intense, intense emotions.

Another one is just constant conflict with a child and the family.

The child just is rebelling, the child just is defiant, the child is disrespectful, the child is always making bad decisions, doing things.

That can really take its toll on you and be very depleting.

So those are kind of the different areas that bring about depletion.

So important to become aware of those in your own life.
