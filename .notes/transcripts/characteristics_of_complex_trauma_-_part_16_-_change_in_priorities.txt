 Well, welcome to another Friday night. We've been working our way through the 60 characteristics of complex trauma  Doing one week on each of the characteristics so we can do a deep dive and to really understanding that particular  characteristic and today we come to  Change in priorities and of all the 60 characteristics. This is probably the one that is  least evident to understand just by reading change in priorities  So I need to begin by just  Explaining what this is all about and then show how it's still an issue for most people  Who come out of complex trauma?  So here's the big picture if you think of a healthy family  You have parents children and basically the priority in that family is love  We are here to care for each other to meet each other's needs and if we work together  We can all get our needs met  Sometimes it will mean that I have to sacrifice my needs temporarily in order to meet your needs  Sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs temporarily in order to meet my needs  But overall the amount of sacrifice that takes place will be 50-50  Everybody will get their needs met with some sacrifices made  So that is the commitment of love within a family  We're all equal. We're all equally important and it's about loving each other meeting each other's needs  And it's not one person who gets their needs met all the time  But never makes a sacrifice. No, there's a give and a take that is constantly happening  Now bring in complex trauma  constant danger for a child  constantly feeling threatened  In order to survive in that environment a child has to say  The priority can no longer be loving others  The priority has to be surviving and that means that my needs are a wee bit more important than your needs that means that  I have to be more important than you if I am going to survive  Endanger and very subtly a  Shift in priorities from love at the core  to survival  Takes place and what I want you to think about is  the ramifications of that shift in priorities  It may not seem like a big deal on the surface  But it is a huge deal  So let me put it this way  When a person is in danger in complex trauma and they shift into survival is now my priority  What basically they are doing is becoming a narcissist not I'm not using this in a bad sense  But they are just a narcissist by definition and it's got to be about me  It's got to be about what I want it's got to be about my agenda  It's got to be about my needs and so if I'm going to survive I have to be in control  And if you're not cooperating with my agenda, I either manipulate you or lash out at you  So that you do cooperate and I might even do some very hurtful things  But that's the only way I am going to survive and not get hurt  repeatedly and so a child not intending to  Becomes a little narcissist  Now what happens then is in cases of extreme trauma  You can get a person who ends up becoming a pure narcissist as they move into adult life  They think they're better than everybody  They always want to look good. They have no concern or empathy about others  They don't know how to love people. They just become great at using people and so they would get diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder  But that's the extreme case  Now most people that come out of complex trauma don't become pure  Narcissist I want you to understand that but  The key thing to understand is that though they're not a pure narcissist  Their limbic brain remains a narcissist and so in their day-by-day life  They can be living out of their cortex which isn't a narcissist and in their cortex they can be loving others  But as soon as their limbic brain becomes triggered, they become a narcissist and  all of the narcissistic tendencies kick in  So what does that mean?  They can be the nicest person in the world  They are living out of their cortex brain. They're serving people people admire them  They have great character. They are they're just wonderful people  But then they get triggered and it's like a different person comes out and  This person is marked by certain characteristic  So the first thing is emotional dysregulation all of a sudden their emotions are out of the control out of control  Over the top they go from zero to a hundred and usually it's anger fear panic  But it is emotional  craziness and  Within a nanosecond it happens  It's not a gradual thing. It's something triggers them and an explosion takes place in nanosecond  When that takes place  Not only do their emotions go crazy, but their thinking gets distorted and  Their perception of events gets distorted  They think they're seeing everything clearly, but they're really not they think they're thinking clearly, but they're really not  They're thinking and perception is now controlled by how they're feeling and so in that moment of time  You can't reason with them. You can't sit down and explain to them how it really is  They can't see that  The next thing that happens is that when they're in that state  They think they're a hundred percent right  Everybody else is wrong  Everybody else is at fault for what is happening, but not them  They don't see their own part in what is going on and so there's a  loss of control that takes place  When they're escalated like that all the internal boundaries and the filters they used to have around what they would do and say  Seemed to disappear  They maybe had a filter before that said never say anything disrespectful  When they're escalated all kinds of disrespect comes out of their mouth  They may have had an internal boundary that said don't hit anything, but when they're escalated they are hitting things  So this massive change takes place and  This person goes from being a saint to being a crazy person  In a nanosecond something has triggered them. So let me give you a couple examples  Just in case you're still not quite getting a clear picture of what I'm talking about  Let's say that you're in a program  And you're required to be there 90% of the time attendance-wise and you're required to remain abstinence from drug and alcohol  But you are missing two or three days a week and the people talk to you and warn you  They give you a contract that you sign and say you'll be there every day  But you keep missing and so they kick you out of the program and  All of a sudden you just go crazy and you're phoning people and you're threatening to  Threatening to phone the news channel to report this organization  Because they kicked you out and you were actually sick that day. That's why you weren't there  You don't think of the other days you weren't there  You just think of that one day and how could they kick me out when I sick that day and you lose it or  Another example might be  Let's say you're in a serious relationship with somebody and  You see that your partner's phone lights up and you notice that it's from a text from his old girlfriend  You don't sit and ask what this is about  Calmly you just go crazy. You go you're cheating on me. You're back with her and away you go  And you can't be reasoned with  Or let's say your partner  Sits down one night with you and says you know what we're just not working out. I  Think it's time for me to move on  So they tell you they're going to be breaking up  Well, that you just go crazy and now the next day  You're just sending like a thousand texts to them. You're phoning them  You're begging them to stay you're promising to do whatever they want you to do just as long as they stay  You just go very crazy  or  Let's say you've been building a friendship with somebody in your recovery journey and  And you text with them a couple times a day  But maybe you start texting them more often and then more often and so they say to you they set a boundary and say please  Just text to me in the morning and in the evening. Don't text me all day long hundreds of texts  And you feel rejected you feel they're saying you're bad and you just lose it you go crazy  You tell them they're a terrible friend if they were a good friend they'd be there for you and and on and on you go in a rant  At this person those are some examples of what I'm talking about  So in all those cases you've been in a really good place  You've been doing really well you you've just been in a very healthy behaviors  But when that trigger takes place you go back to old behaviors you go back to very unhealthy  Ways of dealing with things  So that's what we're talking about  So let me just  Pause here and give you the story of  Narcissists so we're talking about our limbic brain  After complex trauma  Remains a narcissist so what are we talking about so Narcissist is  Based on the Greek myth and Narcissist was a help handsome young man and all kinds of women fell in love with him and wanted a  relationship with them  But he did not reciprocate that love  He was inaccessible to love his heart was hard and  So one of those people one of the rejected lovers was  nemesis and so he went to the gods and wanted them to punish  Narcissist for his unfeeling heart for his inability to love back  When people were pouring love on him and so what happened?  Is that this was the curse one day Narcissist bent down on a pool of water to get a drink  And he saw his reflection in the water and  He fell in love with himself. He was so  Overwhelmed with his own beauty that he fell in love with himself  But here's the curse  He couldn't actually get love back from a reflection  So now the very thing he had done to others his reflection was doing to him  He was wanting to love his reflection. He would spend all day  Brewing over his reflection loving it, but nothing was coming back and so his love  Was being unrequited his love was not being returned  He was experiencing what he had done to others  So what do we see? It's a story of  unrequited love somebody who  Can't give love back, but also somebody who becomes obsessed with himself  Okay, let me take it further. The word  Narcissist comes from  Narc and it's from the word we use narcotic and what do we mean when we say this person needs a narcotic  It's something that will dead in their feelings so they don't feel pain and  so  Narcissist the third characteristic is he was unable to feel  It was like he was on a narcotic and so  Narcissism becomes a person who is so obsessed with self. They don't know how to love others and they don't feel  And that is the story of Narcissist  Now what is very interesting is the story doesn't end there it ends that after that Narcissist dies  But then a flower is born it comes up and  That flower  Gives gives us hope and what it is saying is this  For a narcissist beauty can't come to life  Until they die to that self-obsession  Until they die to that only loving self and not loving others  once they die to that then beauty and life can happen and  So it's a sad tragic story and from that we get the idea of  Narcissism, but let me take it further  Today if you were to go to the DSM or the diagnostic handbook used by  Psychiatry you would find Narcissistic personality disorder and it would have  the characteristics of a narcissist and there's about 18 different characteristics  What I want to focus on are what are the characteristics that show themself  When the limbic Narcissist brain is triggered  So you're going along in your cortex you're very loving you're you're very healthy  You get triggered your Narcissist limbic brain kicks in what comes out  Well you get very angry  You lash out at others  Because they're not giving you what you want  They're not being there for you and so you can say very hurtful  You can do very  destructive things and you can do it in that moment without a conscious in  Because the danger is also being triggered you now fight to get into control  So it's not now about your needs versus mind who's going to sacrifice. It's now me. I have to be the boss  I have to have everything my way  You have to give me what I want and cooperate with my agenda if you don't I will hurt you  So there comes an entitlement a feeling of you owe me if you love me you would do this for me and  Titlement kicks in and  Then you blame everybody for how you're feeling  Other characteristics that come out are you can't see and  What we mean by that is when the Narcissist limbic brain is triggered. It doesn't see clearly it lacks insight  It gets tunnel vision. So it says that your ex-girlfriend has just texted you you must be having an affair. You're cheating on me  You can't see a bigger picture. You get tunnel vision. All you can see is that one thing not anything beyond that and  Then when you're lashing out when you're going crazy  You don't see how you're hurting others because all you can see is your need and you're absorbed with that and  And then when you're blaming everybody you don't see any of your part  so your your  site gets very distorted and  That leads to all kinds of wrong conclusions and thinking and  Then for many people when they're triggered, they think the rules don't apply to them and  Then you don't care how you're affecting others you lack  Feelings towards others. It's all about you. Your needs what you're feeling  self-absorbed  self-obsession  So that brings us to this question  How can my limbic  Narcissist brain get triggered?  And it's important to understand our triggers so that we can catch it when it happens so we don't stay in that Narcissist  limbic brain so we can get back to our cortex back to healthy  So the big picture is this  What triggers your limbic brain is any past trauma that put you in danger where you got hurt or wounded badly  So anything that looks or smells like that now  Will trigger your limbic brain and so it's important to understand that many of those triggers  Take place in intimate relationships  So your deepest wounds as a child came from those closest to you  So now you will get triggered in relationships with those closest to you  So here are some of the triggers any time you fear that they are rejecting you or might abandon you  That is a huge trigger  And let me just say this  Borderline personality disorder is really all about what we're talking about  It's about people who get triggered and  Disregulate and  the common trigger for borderline personality is fear of abandonment fear of rejection  So that's what happened when that text came from the next and that might have just been to ask about one of the kids  Or to talk about an event that the other person might be interested it might have had nothing to do with romance  But it triggered the fear of abandonment  Another common trigger is not getting what you want  Not getting what you see is your needs and desires met and that goes to a very old wound  Which was I live like that growing up my needs were not met  The only one who could get my needs met was me and if something blocks that today I  Lose it because I have to get my needs met or  Anything that makes them look bad or stupid and  That is anything that triggers their shame  So you could have be having a discussion with somebody and you say can I offer some advice?  Well to them you're saying they're stupid. That's why you have to give them advice or you correct them  Or you just present another way of looking at it, but their deep wound is they are always made to look stupid  And so now they feel that maybe that's what you're doing and they lose it and  You can't understand what in the world is going on, but it's triggered their shame and that shame wound runs very deep  And then another one is if you and force  The consequences of the boundaries that you set  So the person that missed  They their attendance was poor in their program the boundary was 90% of the time you be there  They were not there 90% of the time you warn them. They still weren't there so you enforce the boundary and  They lose it because now they have to face consequences for their behaviors, which they don't want to do  So they find a way to try to blame somebody else  Another one is stress when it starts to get to the point of feeling overwhelmed  Because when you're starting to get to the point of feeling overwhelmed  You're actually afraid you're running out of tools to handle the situation and that means  The chance of you getting hurt is going up  And you're gonna lose it and so  Being overwhelmed just sends you to a point where all of a sudden it's nobody supporting me  Everybody should be there to help me if they really cared for me and you go off especially on those  closest to you  Another trigger for many is seeing a lack of justice or experiencing it  So something happens in your life in in your work in your relations with others and you don't feel you're treated fairly  And that triggers your lack of justice as a child and you go crazy  Another one is depression mental health now many with depression  anxiety mental health issues they can manage that quite well and still remain healthy  But when it starts getting worse  They can get to a point where they start  To panic that they're not gonna be able to cope with life and they are triggered  Jealousy is a very common one  That triggers your narcissist limit brain  Another one that's very interesting and important to understand is  If somebody else is being stressed if somebody else is angry if somebody else is sad that could trigger you  I have watched people who they're with their families and dad is upset  And now all of a sudden everybody's panicking and running around like chickens with their heads cut off  And it's because dad's upset  We we got to make sure that we take care of dad and they lose it  And anybody that isn't cooperating to take care of dad is now bad and they lash out at that person  And so the trigger doesn't have to happen internally necessarily and how you're treated  It's just how you respond because your codependency to when somebody else is not in a good place  So let me add one more piece  All of these triggers are the limbic brain but all of them also release cortisol in the brain  And cortisol is like booster juice to the brain it gives you the extra energy to fight or flight  It kicks in adrenaline and that's why there's that nanosecond response of 0 to 100  That's cortisol fueled and why I tell you that  Is that when your narcissist limbic brain is triggered  cortisol comes in  To aid in that trigger which makes it even harder to control  So when your limbic brain is triggered you have a huge challenge on your hands to control it  Because of cortisol and it's powerful effect on your limbic brain  Now a lot of people  They want to minimize that this is not a big deal  Sure, I have a limbic brain that's a narcissist and it gets triggered once in a while  But I'm in my cortex most of the time. So what's the what's the big deal  Well, let me give you some of the big deal  It does so much damage  to relationships  And to your children it creates a complex trauma environment for your children  You see it doesn't matter if you're a good dad 95% of the time or 90% of the time and a good husband  It's in those five to ten percent when you're triggered that the damage gets done  That the kids feel that they can't trust that you're consistent  And that creates an unsettled uncertain feeling that creates complex trauma for them  Secondly, for many people  They're triggers  And how they act in the triggers  Gradually gets more extreme  So they don't stay at the same spot of how they act out when they're triggered  They act out in more extreme ways  So for some it starts with yelling and then it goes to being very disrespectful  Then it goes to hitting things  Then it goes to throwing things then it goes to hitting people and being abusive  So once you allow a certain amount of limbic brain response  And you don't take it seriously it will progress  And it will result in becoming more and more abusive  And then for some people  This is a significant issue because  You lose jobs because of these outbursts  You lose all kinds of opportunities because the word gets out that you are this kind of person  And it can really damage your career and your job opportunities  Further  Afterwards  You're full of regret  Full of guilt for the stuff you said the stuff you did  And it feeds your shame even more  You get so down on yourself  And you fear now that people will abandon you because of your behavior in that time  So there are huge results you might not see them right away  But the damage will gradually become more evident and become greater and greater  So let me just give you this  I've had many people that come to me  And they've been hit by their partner  And they say what you got to understand there's such a wonderful person  95% of the time  This is just a bad they they were having a bad day  This is just an anomaly this isn't who they are  And I go yeah you're partly right  95% of the time they're in their cortex they're healthy  But what I want you to understand is this isn't just having a bad day  And it will never happen again  This is part of a pattern  This is not an anomaly this will happen again  If they don't deal with the stuff that's getting triggered  And as it keeps happening it will get worse and worse  So don't minimize it and just say that it's a bad day  Others will say well they apologize profusely they cried  I've never seen them cry with such a broken heart over what they've done  And they promised to never do it again  I believe that promise and I go I wouldn't  Because it's their limbic brain that's fueled on cortisol  And when it is triggered it is so hard to stop  And just promising that you won't do it again  Usually is not enough  They have to do more than just promise that they won't do it again  So what is it that they have to do  So there's two parts to healing  Let me say this  One way to look at healing from complex trauma  Is to understand that you're healing your limbic brain  That your limbic brain  Has because of complex trauma  Gone from being a very helpful useful wonderful part of being a human  To being a very unhealthy  Can't be trusted misleading destructive part of who we are  And so part of the healing journey is healing our  limbic brain so it's not the narcissist anymore  To do that we have to work on two areas  So number one we need tools for when our limbic brain gets triggered  So that we de-escalate and get back into our cortex  And don't do a whole bunch of damage  Secondly, we have to heal the parts of us that were triggered  So that they're not triggered anymore  And so outside of the times and we're triggered in the rest of our life the other 95 percent  We have to be  Working on healing and growing  In  repairing the damage done  From years ago because of complex trauma  So let me say this  The hardest part of this healing journey is learning  To manage when you're triggered  Because like we said that cortisol fuels this extreme thing and it happens in a nanosecond  So what you're trying to do  Is in that nanosecond  Choosing a different path as to how you will respond  Instead of going down the old path where everything is wanting to go  Where the cortisol is pulling you in that nanosecond you're choosing to go this way  That is so difficult and so what I want you to understand is you're not going to do it perfectly the first time  Probably not the second time or the third time. This is going to be a slow journey  But if after every time you can look back at it and instead of beating yourself up say what could I've done differently  In that nanosecond  You can probably think of one thing you could have done differently and you gradually develop the tools  To choose a different path in that nanosecond, but it is very challenging  The second part of this when you're triggered  Is deescalating getting out of the limbic back into the cortex  So before you say anything before you do anything  deescalate and so we talk about grounding as the way to do that  And so you can do deep breathing  You can do tapping on pressure points which help reduce cortisol  You can go for a walk just to get away from the circumstances  But you need to find something that helps you deescalate after you've been deescalated  Now for some situations you can deescalate within a couple minutes  Other situations that might take you a couple hours  Because of the intensity  But if you can make a deal with yourself that when you're triggered  You bite your tongue  And you don't do anything until you can get your emotions back under control and get back into your cortex  So there's another piece to this that I want you to understand  A lot of people get down on themselves that they got triggered  I'm such a terrible person I keep getting triggered all the time  I shouldn't be so affected by disrespect  I shouldn't be so affected by fear  I shouldn't be so affected by not getting away and they get down on themself  Here's what I would propose to you don't get down on yourself about it  But look at a trigger as an old wound telling you where you need to heal next  It is your inner child, your little you saying, ouch  You need to heal here  And so as you use triggers as a guide as a roadmap pointing you  To the next part of your healing journey  Then as you heal you don't get triggered as often  You don't get triggered as intensely  And as you develop the tools to deescalating it back in your cortex  You're able to work through the trigger more quickly  Until you get to a point where you're not really hardly getting triggered at all  In that area  So important to do that  Now let me give you a very important piece of this healing journey  But it takes a lot of humility and trust to be able to do it  If you have somebody in your life that you respect greatly you trust they carry a lot of weight in your life  Say to them if you see me triggered and going into my narcissist limbic brain  You have permission to come to me and say you need a timeout  I won't take it as condescending or patronizing  I will take it as you recognizing I'm not in a good place  I'm a boat to do something I'll regret and you're treating me like a child out of love not out of trying to shame me  And you're saying you need to go cool down  If you can have the humility to have somebody like that in your life  You will come to appreciate that now you're not going to need them forever  You're just going to need them for a while until you learn to be able to do that for yourself  With that you might also say to somebody  That you respect very much  I sometimes go into my limbic brain without realizing it  Sometimes there's a severe escalation other times it's just a mild escalation, but I start becoming a bit narcissistic  But I'm not aware of it if you see me starting to act like a narcissist  Please point it out to me so that I can become more self-aware of when I'm sliding into that  And you will find that extremely helpful as well  Now let me give you this  If you are in a relationship with somebody who has this narcissist limbic brain and you find  That your relationship is growing but this when they get triggered is causing a lot of trouble  You need to find a way to talk to them and say okay  The next time you go into your limbic brain I am going to say to you I can't talk about this now  I'm not going to say that because I am shutting you out  I'm not saying that to judge you or condemn you or say you're bad  That is your cue that you're in your limbic brain and we cannot resolve or have a rational discussion while you're there  And so I'm going to take myself out of the situation say I can't talk about this now  But we'll come back to it when you're cooled down  Now you can immediately realize that's hard for somebody to hear  And if you say that to somebody when they're escalated they might lash out even more  And so that's why you have to find out a way of being able to say that  To somebody that you're in a relationship with  So that it doesn't end up in a messy ugly conflict  Okay, that's the end of part one  We're going to take a short break and then I'm going to come back and do the Christian part  If you're not interested in that that's no problem at all. We're not offended  You're free to go. We'll see you next week to everybody else. We'll be back in a minute  Well, welcome back. We're looking at the life of Peter and finding that he's been a great  Guide for us in our recovery journey  So many insights that relate to people coming  Out of complex trauma and trying to get healthier  And what I want to look at today is  We will hit times in our recovery journey  Where we go through a time where we face a very deeply rooted issue  And the growth that takes place is some of the most difficult but rewarding growth  But it is hard to make changes at those deep deep levels  And what happens for most of us  Is we can make those changes and do that growth, but that doesn't mean we will never slip back to that old behavior  And a lot of people beat themselves up for that  But what I want you to think about today is  Peter did the same thing  Peter shows us that that happens. We will regress  So don't beat yourself up  One way that many people look at growth or recovery is that it's a linear healing journey  So you can see the straight line  So you go step one, step two, step three  And you make it and it's successful and you move on and you never go back  That's not the journey of healing from complex trauma  It is not a linear journey  The second line is there, show what it's like  It's doing well, it's going down  It's going back, it's doing well  It's up and down, it is messy, it is all over  But over time you see that growth is happening  But we don't like that messy journey  We want it to be a linear journey  But it's not  And we have to accept that  And not beat yourself up for that  Because if we beat yourself up  It usually makes us fail even more  So let me read you the story in Acts 10  Said Peter went up on the flat roof to pray  And it was about noon and he was hungry  And while a meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance  He saw the sky open and something like a large sheet was sat down by its four corners  In the sheet were all sorts of animals, reptiles and birds  Then a voice said to him, get up Peter, kill and eat them  No Lord Peter declared, I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure  And unclean  But the voice spoke again, do not call something unclean if God has made it clean  The same vision was repeated three times  Then the sheet was suddenly pulled up to heaven  Peter was perplexed  What could the vision mean?  Just then the men sent by Cornelius, a Gentile, a non-Jew  Found Peter at Simon's house and standing outside the gate they asked if a man named Simon Peter was staying there  So let me give you the background  God brought the nation of Israel out of slavery in Egypt  And then took them into the desert where they were going to live for the next number of years  And one of the things he does is he creates these food laws  And there's been a lot of discussion as to what's the purpose of these food laws  And I don't know for sure but I think one of the reasons God did it was because they were living in a culture where you didn't have refrigeration  And so meat would go bad very quickly and so how do you protect the people  From getting food poisoning constantly  So got part of the food laws were around living in a culture where there was no refrigeration  And so what came out of that is you could eat sheep, goats, cows, but you couldn't eat pigs  You couldn't eat you could eat certain kinds of fish, but you couldn't eat shellfish  And so they had these laws  Every Jewish boy and girl had those laws drilled into them  If they asked would I have this lobster no no no that would be against God  And it would be reinforced over and over and everybody in the culture followed it it marked the culture  The other thing that was that happened because of that  Is the Jews kind of twisted it to say okay God gave us these laws but he didn't give non-Jews those laws  So he must care more about us than them he must love us more than them  And then they found cautions that God gave them about  If you're going to have relationships with Gentiles be careful of  And so now they were starting to think I think God has made us better than them  I think God is actually giving us the right to be racist towards all those people to hate them  And so that's how they twisted it and that's what came out of that. So it wasn't just food laws now  Though those were key it was also  We're way better than Gentiles Gentiles  They're bad. We should hate them have nothing to do with them  So you can imagine when God lowers the sheet to Peter in a dream  And says Peter here's a pork I want you to have it Peter goes what  And so God has to lower the sheet three times  Because Peter is really having a hard time  Accepting that God you've you've told it for the last two thousand years to not eat pork  Now you're saying pork what's go I this can't be from you God I must be just imagining this  And so God has to do it again and again  For Peter to start to get is God changing the law  So just to help you appreciate that  Think of some deeply and grain belief you had since childhood  So your parents may have drilled into you  Not only that you're to honor them  But that honoring them means that you never say no to them  That you do exactly what they want you don't set boundaries with them  And that was drilled into you over and over again and they may have tried to use the Bible to reinforce that  Bring God into that God will be not be happy with you if you don't do it  And it was just there and then you into church and that's what everybody  In the community in the culture believe and it was drilled into you and then you come into recovery  And it's pointed out to you that your parents have because of all of that  Have caused you to not respect yourself  To not stand up for yourself not just in your relationship with them, but in all kinds of relationships  And you realize if you're ever going to make it in life and have healthy relationships  You have to respect yourself enough to stand up for yourself and say no to people  Wow  To say no to my parents to set a boundary with my parents  A war takes place in you that goes against  Everything that was drilled into you  So whenever you go to change  A deeply instilled belief that's happened since early life  That's not just believed by your family, but by your community or culture  And now you want to change that belief  It sends off shockwaves inside yourself and within the community  And that's what happened to Peter  So now Peter comes from this trance  Where God is lowered this sheet  And then people show up and say there's this Gentile man Cornelius that wants to meet with you  And he goes to Cornelius' house and Cornelius serves him ham  And Peter says oh this is okay now oh this feels so weird this feels so wrong  But I'm going to eat the ham anyways because God said it's clean now  And he's got a war going on inside of him  But then he goes home that day and people the word is out  Peter was at a Gentiles house and he ate ham  And now you got church leaders showing up saying what's wrong with you Peter  You're forsaking God's word  You got people now when Peter walks down the street who just won't even look at him or say hi to him  Because they're embarrassed of him  He's failed them and there would have been conflict there would have been pressure  It would have been  An extremely tense time that would happen  In the church in Peter's life  But Peter stuck to his guns  He continued to follow God's new directions around food laws  But here's the part I want you to see  We're told this Peter came to Antioch  And Paul says this I had to oppose him to his face  For what he did was very wrong  When he first arrived he ate with the Gentile believers he had a ham  He ate with people who are not circumcised and then make a big deal about it  But afterwards some friends of James who was a hard line  Stick to the Jewish laws persons some friends of James came  And when Peter saw them he stopped eating with the Gentiles  He was afraid of the criticism from his own people  Who insisted on the necessity of circumcision and as a result  Other Jewish believers followed Peter's example  And Paul says I had to jump in and oppose Peter and tell him you're wrong  You're doing damage to stop him  But here's what I want you to see  Peter went through that very very difficult life change decision  From never eat pork to its okay to eat pork  But then he came to a time where there was so much pressure put on him he regressed  To the old behavior  And so what I want you to understand is this  If one of the greatest Christians living at that time  Could have a day where they regressed to an old behavior  We can too  So if you find yourself doing well, but then you regress  Don't beat yourself up, but  Be sorry that you did it learn from it  Get back on track and it will turn into a growth opportunity and growth will happen  But please don't beat yourself up  Peter the great Peter even he regressed let's pray  Father thank you for your patience with us  Thank you that you're so gracious  And that you know that our journey of healing and growth is slow and messy  And you're okay with that and you keep working in our lives and forgiving us  And I just pray for any who are struggling any who have regressed  They you would just help them to accept your forgiveness and grace that they would learn from it  And continue to grow  Amen  Well, that's the end of our Friday night. Thanks again for being here
