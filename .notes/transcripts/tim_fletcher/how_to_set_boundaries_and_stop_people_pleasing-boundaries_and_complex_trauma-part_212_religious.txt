I'm responsible to fix your anger when you explode.

I have to fix it when you're sad.

And so you think a relationship means I have to become a parent to this other person.

Or if I'm in a relationship with you I can never say no to you.

I have to do whatever you want.

I have to serve you and really become a slave to you.

Or if I get in a relationship with you I have to know and read and anticipate every need that you might have.

I have to be a mind reader.

I have to be able to see all of your cues so I know what you're wanting without you having to ask.

So now I have to develop super powers to read and know your needs and wants if I am going to have a relationship with you.

What that means for people is if I get in a relationship with you I will lose me.

Because my life now will be understanding your emotions, not mine.

Understanding your needs, not mine.

Understanding your thinking, not mine.

So I don't know where I end and you begin anymore.

I lose me in you.

And then some people even think that if you get into a committed romantic relationship that the other person totally owns you.

You lose any say, any will.

You can't stand up for yourself.

You can't express needs.

They own you.

And that usually leads to great abuse.

All because of bad boundaries.

One other thing that enmeshed families do is deep down they know there's not a lot of healthy intimacy in the family.

So they say we're close because we do lots of stuff together.

We never talk at a deep level.

But because we have fun constantly together that proves that we are a very healthy close family.

And so the fear is that now if I get in a relationship with somebody I can never have my own time or my own space that we have to do everything together.

In order to be close.

And so all of those things can be very confusing for people.

So if you grew up in some of that and now you're coming into recovery and you're realizing wow there's a whole bunch of stuff there that's totally unhealthy.

I need to start setting healthy boundaries where I stand up for myself.

Where I express my needs.

Where I have space to do my own thing and do self care.

If you start doing that people in your family are going to feel that you're saying they're bad.

And they're going to oppose or give you a hard time and you could end up with a lot of opposition.

And they're going to possibly even try to get you to go back to the way things used to be so that you live by their rules again.

So learning to set boundaries in recovery is essential.

But it creates a lot of pressure.

It creates resistance and opposition from others.

Often from those closest to you.

So be prepared for that and realize I need not just to set boundaries I need to figure out how to enforce those boundaries.

And that's what we're going to look at next time.

As we come into recovery one of the first boundaries that people learn is I can't hang around with people that are still using.

Because that will drag me down.

Or if I'm in a relationship and my kid is using or my partner relapses I have to somehow figure out how to handle them because I can't just say no big deal do whatever you want because that will destroy our relationship and it could drag me back down.

So you early in recovery have to figure out what do you do when people are living in ways that aren't healthy and you're in a relationship with them how do you handle that so that you don't get severely damaged yourself.

So when we come to the Christian part that's actually one of the very clear teachings that Jesus talks about in the Bible and I think once you begin to see it you're going to go wow this ties in so beautifully with what we do in recovery.

So it's found in Matthew 18 and it says this if another believer or somebody on the same path or trying to go in the same direction or in a relationship with you kind of in your extended family or surrogate family if they sin against you and that just means they do something unhealthy that violates love that hurts you and hurts the relationship.

So what it's assuming is this isn't just as an acquaintance or a very casual friend it's somebody that you have been in a closer relationship with and now something's happened where they've hurt you done something that is a moral violation they've lied to you they've disrespected you in a big way all of those things.

They've violated your trust.

How do we respond?

Now for a lot of people in recovery they would say I'm not even going to try to work that out you do that to me you're out of my life.

But what we want to learn in recovery is healthier relationships.

And the question becomes should I try to resolve that issue with the person and what happens if I can't resolve that issue with the person what then do I do?

And that's what Jesus is going to talk about and it's all about boundaries.

So he says you do a three step process.

So number one go privately to the person and point out the offense.

If the other person listens and confesses it you've won that person back.

You've healed the relationship you've restored it and you've actually grown in the relationship because of it.

You might have to rebuild some trust but it's been a very positive thing.

So let me note there it says go privately.

Don't broadcast it all over Facebook about what the person did to hurt you.

Don't go behind their back.

And gossip to everybody about it.

If you really care for that person and there's a closeness in that relationship you go and talk to them privately and try to restore it without anybody else even know what's going on.

But what happens if they don't respond to that?

You go to part two.

But if you are unsuccessful take one or two other people with you and go back again so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three women or two witnesses.

So a couple of things there that I want you to see.

Some people in unhealthy relationships they want to get their own way and their partner's not going along with their agenda.

So they recruit two or three people to put pressure on them to do something that the other person wants.

But what I want you to understand is they're putting pressure on that person to do something unhealthy.

So that's the wrong type of what we call triangulation.

What we're talking about here is we're getting people who will support us and care about this person who's living unhealthy and we want to put some pressure on them to begin to be healthy again.

Very big difference.

So you take those people and you go and you talk to them.

Another piece with that is they can act as witnesses.

So if the person you're confronting later goes to everybody and says this person said this to me and did this those two or three people can step up and say no, that's not what happened.

We were there.

And they can prevent a lot of distortions from happening from the parties involved.

But what happens when that person still doesn't respond to two or three people?

You go to part three.

If the person still refuses to listen take your case to the church and that is to your surrogate family to your people who are on the same path as you.

So tell others about it and if he or she won't accept the church's decision treat that person like a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.

So this has often been misunderstood.

So let me explain it.

And I think you'll see the wisdom of it.

It's often misunderstood and presented in very much a shunning an excommunication a very severe thing.

And I want you just to get the big picture of what's going on.

So first of all, Jesus is not saying appoint yourself the moral police to stick your nose into everybody's business and to tell everybody if they're wrong or not and to always create drama by confronting people.

He's not talking about doing that.

That is very unhealthy.

He's talking about your close relationships and managing those relationships.

What then or what He is unselfish and what He's not saying as well is don't just have certain failures or things that you go and confront people about but you do all kinds of other hurtful things yourself.

So you might gossip but you don't ever see that as being a big deal.

But if somebody was to post something on Facebook about you you would be in their face but if that person went home and overate and abused somebody else in their life you wouldn't even care.

You just focus on certain things.

And we all are in danger of ranking certain things as worse than others and treating people severely in the things we think are bad and ignoring a lot of other things.

We need to have a consistency when we evaluate our relationships about the things that violate love.

So what is He saying?

He is saying love has boundaries.

Relationships to be healthy need boundaries.

And some of the boundaries are about when somebody in the relationship steps outside of unhealthy and they begin to do things that are hurtful to the other person, to themselves, to the relationship.

They lie, they cheat, they steal all of those different things.

What Jesus is saying is love initially will fight to restore the relationship.

It values the importance of God and the relationship of good relationships.

It values the importance of close, deeper intimacy with friendships.

And so it is willing to fight.

But it does have a limit.

It will set a boundary if the other person becomes abusive or isn't committed to grow and isn't committed to own their stuff and deal with their stuff and be willing to change from unhealthy to healthy, then I need to put greater and greater distance between myself and them.

That is what Jesus is saying.

And so he is saying before you cut a person out of your life or before you put a severe boundary, make sure the person is not willing to change.

Make sure you've done everything possible in a healthy way to help them see what they're doing and the damage that it's doing.

So he is giving us a guideline.

Relationships are only healthy if both parties are committed to grow.

If both parties are committed to own their stuff when they fail and to change.

If you have one person in the relationship who's not willing to do that, who hardens their heart and says, I'm not going to look at myself, I'm not going to change anything, rather I'm going to distort every conflict and argument and somehow make it the other person's fault, how do I know that that person has hardened their heart?

How do I know that they're refusing to change?

And that's why you do this three-step process.

It gives you the tools or the parameters to evaluate whether somebody has hardened their heart and committed to change.

If you discover they haven't or they have hardened their heart and they're not willing to change, then you say, I can't be in a close relationship with you anymore because it's hurting me, it could drag me down, and it's going to hurt the children or whoever else, so I need to set a boundary that puts greater distance between me and you to protect me, the children, and my own recovery.

That's what it's about.

And so Jesus is saying that love of a person has a tough side.

Tough side.

So loving somebody doesn't mean you never say no to them.

Loving somebody doesn't mean you never make hard decisions that push them away from you.

It might feel cruel.

It might feel unloving to say, I can't be seeing you now.

You're too toxic.

That doesn't feel loving, but it actually is because it's forcing them to say, if you keep living the way you're living, here's one of the consequences.

You can no longer have me in your life.

And the benefits of that relationship.

Hopefully that might make them do some thinking about their behavior that they never would have thought about if you just kept allowing them to use you and abuse you.

So love has a tough side.

Now let me just fill in a few other things that Jesus is talking about.

In this section of the book of Matthew, Jesus is talking about being a humble person.

What is humility?

And what is significant is what Jesus is saying here is humble people stand up for themselves.

To be humble doesn't mean you're a doormat and let everybody use you and abuse you.

He's saying, no, humility respects itself.

It doesn't see itself as better than everybody.

It sees itself equal, and therefore it will stand up to people that are trying to put them down and walk all over them.

So being humble has a self-respect element that is willing to stand up for itself when it is being treated in an unloving way.

The next thing that Jesus is talking about in this is the willingness of love to pursue a person when they're straying, when they're moving and unhealthy.

So they will pursue them.

They will try to work it out.

They will try to confront the person and hopefully help them see what they're doing and the damage it's doing.

They're doing it.

They're doing it out of a love for the person and a desire to restore everything to healthy.

It's not done out of a self-serving thing.

It's done because it wants the best for the relationship and for the other person.

I find it very instructive to see how did God carry out these guidelines of the three-step process and how did Jesus carry it out?

So if you go back to the book of Judges in the Old Testament, one of the early books, what you find there is Israel started moving more and more into unhealthy behavior.

They drifted away from God.

Every time they did, God let them experience negative consequences, pain.

That pain initially drove them back to God and they were sorry and they realigned with God, restored the relationship, but then they would start drifting again.

After a while, they drifted and never came back and God allowed them to go into worse and worse, negative consequences and it became a very painful existence for them.

What I want you to understand is that took place over hundreds and hundreds of years.

And as long as God saw that they were facing things and kept coming back, He would restore them.

He would restore them.

He didn't implement the severe consequence of the evil that God had done to them.

He didn't restore them.

He didn't do the consequence until the milder pain no longer brought them back to Him.

But they just kept rebelling.

Then He went to the more severe.

So the point is, we don't just say, okay, I gave you three chances, you're gone.

You might give them a chance and then they come back and then they fall away, but then they come back.

You don't go to the severe one until they just stay out there and never come back.

That's further explained by Jesus' example.

Jesus example with the 12 followers that he had.

Those 12 men were very unhealthy.

They argued all the time about who was the greatest, who Jesus loved the most, who Jesus would appoint to the highest position in his kingdom when he set it up.

Jesus confronted them about that and then a little while later they would do it all over again.

Jesus didn't say, okay, I'm done with you.

You're fired.

You're out of my life after three times.

What he saw is though they kept falling into who's the greatest arguments, they were growing in other areas.

They were becoming more and more healthy in other areas.

That one area they were struggling with more than others.

So the point is this.

We're all in relationships with people and people are in relationships with us and nobody's perfect.

pastor plate presentationasse our issues.

So the goal is not to say be perfect or you're out of my life.

The goal is we both are working on our stuff.

Not perfectly and we're not going to get it all figured out.

But if I see growth in you, I will tolerate a certain amount of messiness.

But there will be some things that if you're not changing over time that are going to be deal breakers.

And I will have to end this relationship if it gets severe enough.

So Jesus didn't rush to enforce the negative consequences.

He went to grace, but he was looking for growth in all kinds of areas.

And that is what we need to do.

So I hope this helps you understand that what we're doing in this whole process of figuring out boundaries with people who are being hurtful is are they willing to change and own their stuff?

Or have they hardened their hearts?

Have they hardened their hearts?

Have they hardened their hearts?

And have they hardened their hearts?

And have they hardened their hearts?

And have they hardened their hearts?

And have they hardened their hearts?

Because if they have, then I'm going to need a severe boundary.

If they're willing to change and they are changing in other areas of their life, then I'm going to be a little more patient with the process with them because relationships are important and I'm not perfect and I want everybody growing in their life just as much as I want to grow in my life.

I hope it helps you realize we need boundaries.

They're part of recovery.

They're part of our faith.

And they're part of life and getting healthy.

Let's pray.

Father, thank you for this clear teaching and it just connects so well with what people learn in recovery and reinforces and gives us a bigger picture on all of this boundary stuff.

And I just pray as we have this journey together of understanding boundaries, figuring out boundaries that we need and the relationships that we have, that you would just guide each person and give them the strength to do it.

Amen.
