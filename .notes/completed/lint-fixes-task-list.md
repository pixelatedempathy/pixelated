## Warnings to Fix (955 warnings)
- Will be addressed after critical errors are resolved

## Progress Log
- **Started**: Now
- **Current Status**: Fixed 15 critical errors (all no-empty-object-type + ban-ts-comment errors)
- **Files Created**: lint-fixes-task-list.md
- **Files Modified**: 
  - /workspaces/pixelated/src/components/ui/accordion/accordion.tsx (converted 4 empty interfaces to type aliases)
  - /workspaces/pixelated/tests/e2e/user-acceptance.spec.ts (removed 2 unused @ts-expect-error directives)
  - /workspaces/pixelated/src/simulator/hooks/useRealTimeAnalysis.ts (added eslint-disable for module augmentation)
  - /workspaces/pixelated/src/components/ui/input.tsx (converted 1 empty interface to type alias)
  - /workspaces/pixelated/src/lib/services/redis/__tests__/vitest.setup.ts (converted 1 empty interface to type alias)
  - /workspaces/pixelated/src/e2e/breach-notification.spec.ts (replaced 2 {} types with unknown)
- **Next Action**: Continue with no-require-imports errors

## Check-in Protocol
After each sub-task completion:
1. Mark the sub-task as completed [x]
2. Update the progress log
3. Run linter to verify fixes
4. Request approval from Ollama Overlord before proceeding

## Check-in Log Entry - 2025-06-05T07:31:28.992Z

**Task Completed:** Testing the new automated Ollama check-in system with improved response parsing and task list logging

**Improvements Suggested:**
- Implement unit tests for the response parsing component to ensure robustness and prevent regressions.
- Enhance documentation of the task list logging mechanism, including error handling and edge cases.
- Consider refactoring the system architecture to better separate concerns between response parsing and task list management for improved scalability.

**Decision:** YES

## Check-in Log Entry - 2025-06-05T07:34:09.619Z

**Task Completed:** Created automated Ollama check-in scripts with proper response parsing

**Improvements Suggested:**
- Consider implementing a logging mechanism to track script execution and any potential errors for better debugging and auditing purposes.
- For better maintainability, modularize the script into smaller functions with clear responsibilities, adhering to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle.
- Enhance testing by incorporating unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for the entire script's functionality, ensuring the robustness of your automated checks.

**Decision:** YES
