# MCP Server Security Measures

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the MCP (Management Control Panel) Server, focusing on agent token revocation and security lockdown protocols as part of Phase 6 security enhancements.

## 1. Agent Token Revocation System

### 1.1 Architecture

The token revocation system implements a comprehensive JWT token blacklisting mechanism using Redis for fast lookups:

- **TokenManager**: Core service for managing token lifecycle and blacklisting
- **AuthService Integration**: Validates tokens against blacklist during authentication
- **Redis-based Storage**: Efficient token storage with automatic expiration

### 1.2 Features

- **Per-Token Blacklisting**: Individual JWT tokens can be revoked by their full token value
- **Agent-Based Revocation**: All tokens for a specific agent can be revoked at once
- **Automatic Cleanup**: Tokens are automatically removed after their natural expiration
- **JTI Support**: Support for revoking tokens by JWT ID if included

### 1.3 Implementation Details

```python
# Example token revocation
await token_manager.blacklist_token(jwt_token, agent_id)

# Check if token is blacklisted
if await token_manager.is_token_blacklisted(jwt_token):
    raise AuthenticationError("Token has been revoked")

# Revoke all tokens for an agent
await token_manager.revoke_all_agent_tokens(agent_id)
```

### 1.4 Validation Process

The authentication service now includes token revocation checking:

1. Check if token is in blacklist before any other validation
2. Decode JWT token to extract claims
3. Validate token type and expiration
4. Verify agent exists and is active
5. Return token payload if all checks pass

## 2. Security Lockdown Protocols

### 2.1 Emergency Lockdown

The system provides emergency lockdown capabilities for immediate security response:

- **Global Lockdown**: Disable all agent access immediately
- **Selective Lockdown**: Lock down specific agents based on threat indicators
- **Automatic Logging**: All lockdown events are logged for audit purposes

### 2.2 Rate Limit Enforcement

Automatic enforcement of rate limiting violations:

- **Temporary Suspension**: Violating agents are temporarily suspended
- **Token Revocation**: All tokens for violating agents are revoked
- **Cooldown Period**: Agents are automatically reactivated after cooldown
- **Incident Logging**: All violations are logged as security incidents

### 2.3 Security Incident Management

- **Centralized Logging**: All security incidents stored in Redis
- **Retention Policy**: 30-day retention for security incidents
- **Search Capability**: Recent incidents can be retrieved by timestamp
- **Severity Classification**: Incidents classified by severity level

## 3. API Endpoints Security

### 3.1 Authentication Validation

All protected endpoints now check for revoked tokens:

- Middleware automatically validates tokens against blacklist
- Authentication failures return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Structured error responses with security-appropriate messages

### 3.2 Agent Management

Enhanced security for agent-related operations:

- Agent status changes are logged
- Token regeneration invalidates all previous tokens
- API key rotation is supported

## 4. Configuration Requirements

### 4.1 Redis Configuration

The security system requires Redis for token storage:

```python
# Redis configuration for security features
redis_config = {
    "max_connections": 100,
    "socket_timeout": 30,
    "socket_connect_timeout": 10
}
```

### 4.2 Token Expiration

JWT tokens have configurable expiration times:

- Default expiration: 1 hour (configurable)
- Blacklist entries persist until token expiration
- Automatic cleanup through Redis TTL

## 5. Security Best Practices

### 5.1 Token Security

- Use strong JWT secrets (minimum 32 characters)
- Implement short token lifetimes where possible
- Rotate JWT secrets regularly
- Monitor token usage patterns for anomalies

### 5.2 Agent Security

- Regularly review agent status and permissions
- Implement principle of least privilege
- Monitor agent activity patterns
- Use strong API keys with proper entropy

### 5.3 Incident Response

- Establish clear procedures for security incidents
- Regular security audits of token and agent data
- Monitor system logs for security-relevant events
- Maintain incident response documentation

## 6. Monitoring and Auditing

### 6.1 Security Metrics

- Token revocation rate
- Lockdown event frequency
- Authentication failure patterns
- Agent status change history

### 6.2 Audit Trail

All security-related actions are logged with:
- Timestamp
- Agent ID (if applicable)
- Action type
- Initiator
- Outcome

## 7. Compliance Considerations

The security measures support HIPAA compliance requirements:
- Access control mechanisms
- Audit logging capabilities
- Secure token management
- Incident response procedures

## 8. Testing and Validation

### 8.1 Security Testing

- Test token revocation effectiveness
- Validate lockdown procedures
- Verify incident logging accuracy
- Confirm proper error handling

### 8.2 Performance Impact

- Token validation overhead is minimal (single Redis call)
- Blacklist storage is efficient
- System performance impact is negligible
- Proper connection pooling is implemented

## 9. Maintenance and Operations

### 9.1 Regular Maintenance

- Monitor Redis memory usage
- Review security incident logs
- Update JWT secrets regularly
- Validate lockdown procedures periodically

### 9.2 Incident Response

- Documented procedures for security events
- Clear escalation paths
- Regular testing of response procedures
- Post-incident review and improvement

This security implementation provides comprehensive protection against token-based attacks and enables rapid response to security incidents while maintaining system performance and usability.
