            At Pixelated Empathy, the privacy and security of your information
            is our highest priority. We've engineered our systems from the
            ground up with privacy-by-design principles and cutting-edge
            encryption technology. This Privacy Policy details how we collect,
            use, protect, and handle your personal information and protected
            health information (PHI) when you use our services.

            HIPAA Compliance Commitment
          </h2>
          <p>
            Pixelated Empathy is fully committed to compliance with the Health
            Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and all related
            regulations. As a healthcare technology provider, we implement all
            required administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to
            protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
          </p>
          <p>
            For healthcare providers using our platform, we execute Business
            Associate Agreements (BAAs) that clearly outline our respective
            responsibilities regarding the protection of PHI. Our entire
            platform is subjected to regular third-party HIPAA compliance audits
            to ensure we meet or exceed all statutory requirements.
          </p>

            Information We Collect
          </h2>
          <p>
            We collect information that you provide directly to us, including:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
            <li>Account information (name, email, professional credentials)</li>
            <li>Authentication credentials (securely stored)</li>
            <li>Therapy session content and communications</li>
            <li>Billing and payment information</li>
            <li>Usage data and platform analytics</li>
            <li>Technical information about your devices and connection</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            For healthcare providers, we may collect protected health
            information (PHI) about your clients. This information is always
            encrypted using our advanced security measures described below.
          </p>

          <h2
            class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4"

            Advanced Security Architecture
          </h2>
          <p>
            Our platform implements multiple layers of security and encryption:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):</strong> The cornerstone
              of our security architecture, FHE allows our AI systems to analyze and
              process your data while it remains fully encrypted. This means your
              sensitive information is never exposed in an unencrypted form, even
              during processing.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted on your
              device before transmission to our servers, ensuring data is protected
              from the moment it leaves your device.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Communications between users
              are encrypted end-to-end, meaning only the intended recipients can decrypt
              and view the content.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>HIPAA-Compliant Data Storage:</strong> All stored data uses
              AES-256-GCM encryption with secure key management and regular key rotation.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> Our systems are designed
              so that we technically cannot access your unencrypted data, even if
              compelled to do so.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2

            style="color: #4a9a95 !important;"
          >
            How We Use Your Information
          </h2>
          <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
            <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services</li>
            <li>Process transactions and send related information</li>
            <li>Authenticate users and protect against unauthorized access</li>
            <li>
              Generate anonymized, aggregated analytics about service usage
            </li>
            <li>Comply with legal obligations, including HIPAA requirements</li>
            <li>
              Detect and prevent security incidents and fraudulent activity
            </li>
            <li>
              Send technical notices, updates, security alerts, and

            Information Sharing and Disclosure
          </h2>
          <p>
            Due to our zero-knowledge encryption architecture, we technically
            cannot access your data in a decrypted form. We do not sell, trade,
            or otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information or
            PHI to outside parties except in the following limited
            circumstances:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
            <li>
              <strong>With Your Explicit Consent:</strong> We will share your information
              with third parties only when you have authorized us to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted
              third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our
              business, or providing services to you, as long as these parties agree
              to keep this information confidential and secure. All such parties sign
              BAAs when they may encounter PHI.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information when
              required by law, such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or
              other legal process. However, due to our encryption architecture, we
              may only be able to provide encrypted data that cannot be decrypted
              without your keys.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Pixelated Empathy is involved
              in a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets,
              you will be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website
              of any change in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any
              choices you may have regarding your information.
            </li>
          </ul>

          >
            Data Retention and Deletion
          </h2>
          <p>
            We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide our
            services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy,
            unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law.
            For PHI, we follow HIPAA-mandated retention periods.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you delete your account, we initiate a secure deletion process
            that permanently removes your personal data from our systems within
            30 days. Due to our encryption architecture, deleted data cannot be
            recovered once this process is complete.
          </p>

            Security Incident Response
          </h2>
          <p>
            In the unlikely event of a security breach, we maintain a
