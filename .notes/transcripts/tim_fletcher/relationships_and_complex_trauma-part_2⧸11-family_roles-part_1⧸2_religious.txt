And Jesus is saying, you can't do it on your own.

There's something broken inside.

And so you have to go there and with God's help and then surrender.

And we use that meekness, the little jockey on a horse.

So I got thinking about all of that.

And I got thinking, there's actually a part of the Bible that gives us a word picture of what Jesus taught.

And it is Psalm 23.

And if you're familiar with the Bible, Psalm 23 is, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.

He makes me lie down in green pastures.

He leads me beside quiet waters.

He restores my soul.

And then the verse that's used at many funerals, even though I'm walking in the streets, walking through the valley of the shadow of death, I will not be afraid for you're with me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.

And why that ties in with the Beatitudes is because what David is saying, then David was the writer, and he was a shepherd boy when he was a young man.

And as he looked at sheep every day, he thought, boy, there, people are a lot like sheep.

And what he really meant was, children are a lot like sheep.

And we said last week that children operate out of the limbic part of their brain, the emotional part.

They make decisions based on how they feel or will it make me feel good.

Complex trauma, people are children that never grew up emotionally.

They're still stuck in the limbic part of their brain.

And what David is saying is complex trauma people are very much like sheep.

And that is what I want to show you tonight.

And then that ties in with why Jesus said, you need to be broken, you need to be surrendered.

That's what sheep have to do.

Because sheep cannot survive without a shepherd.

Do you realize that sheep is the only animal in the world that cannot survive in the wild by itself?

Sheep are their own worst enemy.

And if left to themselves, they will promptly destroy themselves.

So let me help you understand a bit about sheep.

And then maybe you'll understand yourself as a child and how you might feel today.

So number one, sheep can't survive in the wild because they are defenseless.

So you think about it, sheep don't have sharp claws.

They can't fight.

They're slow.

And with all that wool on them, they're even slower.

So they can't run for their life.

They don't have sharp teeth or fangs.

And they're not very strong.

So they're useless when it comes to protecting themselves.

They can't do that.

Because of that, sheep are creatures controlled by fear.

They are afraid of almost everything.

If they're in a new situation, unknown to them, they're afraid.

Sound like you?

Fear of the unknown.

Fear of change.

If there's conflict in the herd, they're full of fear.

And so a sheep, if they have any fear at all, they can't lie down and relax and they won't eat.

They will just sit there in an anxiety state.

And they won't be able to lie down or eat until they feel safe.

If they see a predator, then they are full of fear.

They can't lie down or eat.

And if they can't see their shepherd, if they feel abandoned or rejected or out of touch, they're full of fear.

Very much like a child and a complex trauma person.

Because of that, they have a very difficult time trusting.

So sheep will always think they're smarter than the shepherd.

They will always think the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.

And they just have a great deal of time, hard time trusting, much like you.

Then they're extremely stubborn.

And complex trauma creates a stubbornness.

And if you have a stubborn personality and add complex trauma, you are super stubborn.

And nobody likes being around you when you're in the stubborn zone.

Because you can't be reasoned with.

That's the way a sheep is.

And then sheep live by a mob instinct.

So if one sheep claims to be the leader, and they start running over a cliff, all the sheep will follow them.

They just go and follow the leader.

Much like people from complex trauma.

And the sad part is sheep are one of the dumbest creatures around.

You know when you put sheep in a field, they won't just eat the top of the grass, they'll eat the roots too.

So they'll destroy a field in no time, and pretty soon they won't have anything to eat.

And then a sheep will eat dirty water, poisoned water, poisoned plants.

They don't check anything out.

They don't know how to check things out.

And so you leave them by themselves, they're dead in no time at all.

And so what David is emphasizing, and it's what Jesus was emphasizing, we can't survive on our own.

We're our own worst enemy.

We need a shepherd that we surrender to.

So let me just walk you through a little bit in the Psalms.

So it starts out, He makes me lie down in green pastures.

He leads me beside still waters.

So two things David wants us to see.

It's the same thing.

He is saying, God or the Lord is my shepherd.

I have the best shepherd in the world.

I have the only shepherd that knows what is best for me and wants what is best for me and can make it happen.

So He gives me green grass, not dried, brown, burnt grass.

He provides me with the best grass and He makes it so I can lie down.

In other words, He helps me deal with my fear so that I can relax.

Now, let me say this.

That, David didn't write this the first day of having God as a shepherd.

He wrote this at the end of his life.

After he had gradually learned to trust God and now looking back, I think he's saying, I wish I had trusted Him sooner.

I wish it hadn't taken me so long because He is a good shepherd.

And then it says, He leads me beside quiet waters.

That's significant.

A sheep's fear is so great that it won't drink from a rushing stream.

If the water's moving, it freaks the sheep out.

It thinks it's dangerous.

And it won't drink even though it's super thirsty.

So what does a shepherd do if he doesn't have a well to draw from and put it in a trough?

Or if there's not a quiet pond, if there's only a stream, he will take the time to get a bunch of rocks and put them across the stream or halfway across to make a little dam so that behind the rocks is a quiet stream and behind the rocks is a quiet little pool of water.

And the rushing water can go around the outside but the sheep will then drink because He's created some quiet water.

So this is a shepherd who knows the sheep intimately.

He knows how they click.

He knows how they're wired.

He knows their fears.

He knows what they need.

And He takes all of that into account.

That's what David's wanting to say about his shepherd.

Then it says that He guides me in a righteous path.

He is a reliable guide.

Then the next one I love.

It says He restores my soul.

That is super significant.

Sheep have a problem.

They grow all this wool.

And farmers love it and they make clothes from it and it's a great source of income.

But what happens before the sheep get sheared is in those final weeks before they get a shave, they got so much wool that often when they lay down, if it's on a little bit of a slope, they will flop onto their back because the wool weighs so much.

And then once they're on their back, it's like a turtle.

They can't get back on their feet.

And the shepherd's term for that is that they are cast down.

Now what is significant is this.

If they're in that cast down position, they start to panic.

And if the shepherd doesn't get them within a half an hour and stand them back on their feet, they will die of panic.

That is how bad it is.

Now David wrote another Psalm, Psalm 42 and Psalm 43, and he starts both Psalms by saying this, Why are you cast down, O my soul?

What is he saying?

He's saying as I do my journal today, I am in a panic stage.

I am like a sheep on his back that feels hopeless.

And I am about to die.

And I am ready to give up hope.

Why?

What is going on?

And then he says this, Hope in God, and you will yet praise him.

So David was saying, I at times am like a sheep when I get super depressed and I begin to feel hopeless and I start to despair.

That's when I need my shepherd.

Now there's a second way that a shepherd restores the soul.

So the first is, when I'm that hopeless cast down state, he restores my soul by giving me hope, by standing me on my feet again.

There's a second time when a sheep will lose hope.

That's in the hot dry summer.

In a time of drought.

So you can imagine they're out on a mountain, and they're going from pasture field to pasture field, no grass, no grass.

And they're carrying all this wool, they're hot, they're thirsty, they're getting discouraged, and they're getting to feel hopeless.

Their soul is cast down.

Where does a shepherd take that worn out, exhausted, thirsty, cast down sheep?

To a valley.

You realize water always goes to the lowest point.

So even where there's a hot summer or a drought, where can you find water for your sheep?

In a valley.

But what does he go on in the next verse to say?

That the valleys are dark.

Sheep don't like valleys.

Valleys are scary places because there's shadows in valleys.

You lose the sun more quickly in valleys.

And that was a mountainous territory.

And so what does God say to us?

Do you realize mountain tops are great?

But you can't grow anything on a mountain top.

Where do you grow stuff?

In a valley.

Where do you find water?

In a valley.

Where do you take a person when they're not, they're messed up in their life, and they're losing hope?

Guess what God does?

He takes us to a dark place, where it's a valley, where we say, God, I need you.

And then he says, okay, now this valley will become not just a problem area, a scary area, it will become a place that restores your soul, because now I'm going to feed you.

And now you're going to get some water.

So sometimes the most difficult, darkest times in our life, we hate and we say, God, what are you doing?

He's saying, I'm bringing you to a valley to restore your soul.

I don't know if you've gone through that, but I sure have on many occasions.

And when I go into a valley, I say, God, you're a bad shepherd.

I don't like you right now.

We are not on speaking terms.

And he says, hang around.

And after a while, I surrender.

And that valley, which I thought would destroy me, fed me.

And it made me stronger and it restored my soul.

So let me go on to the next one.

Even though I walked through a valley of the shadow of death.

And what that means is, it was the deepest, darkest valley.

It was the worst valley.

It was a valley that felt so scary that the sheep went in there like a good, calm, sex trauma person with a worst case scenario going, okay, I'm gonna die.

That's where they went in their thinking.

And so again, you go, I don't like my shepherd.

I don't think he's a good guide.

And sometimes God's guidance in our life seems wrong or very confusing.

And God seems a little bit cruel.

But God says, just wait a while.

Hang in there.

And so again, if there's no pasture anywhere else, you go to a valley.

Now here's what God does.

A shepherd had two instruments that they carry.

Rod and a staff.

And a rod was like a little billy club.

And it was a short thing that the shepherd would use as a weapon to protect against wild animals.

He would put a rod on the sheep.

He would use it to give the sheep a little smack if they needed it, some discipline.

And he would use it just to count the sheep.

But that's not the main thing that he uses in the valley.

He uses this big, long staff with a hook in the end.

And the point is this.

What would happen as they go through that dark valley is the sheep would start to get afraid.

And they go, I can't see my shepherd.

It's too dark in here.

So the shepherd would take that long staff and just place it so it touched the sheep's side.

And what the shepherd was doing was saying this.

You can't see me, but you can feel that I'm here.

I'm giving you a little reminder of my presence.

And as soon as the sheep felt that staff touch their side, they would relax.

The shepherd's here.

He hasn't abandoned me.

He knows I'm here.

He can see me.

Even though I can't see him, I have a good shepherd.

Now there's one other thing I want you to notice.

It started out, the Lord is my shepherd.

I shall not want.

He makes me.

Now if you remember grammar in school, that was third person.

He makes me lie down in green pastures.

He leads me beside still waters.

He restores my soul.

He guides me on a righteous path.

Then it says, even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.

He doesn't say, for he is with me.

Guess what happens in a valley?

God goes from being the distant shepherd to being your friend.

You develop a relationship in valleys.

And what David is saying is something very spiritual happens in a valley is you get to know God.

It drives you to God.

It makes you want a better relationship with God.

Do you know what happened if we were on mountaintops all the time?

We would send God a little message.

He would say, I'm going to send you to a place where you can have a more peaceful life.

I don't need you anymore.

He would send a little note saying, I don't think I need you anymore.

We wouldn't care about spending time with him because the sun's great up here.

The emotions are great.

The sunsets are beautiful.

Who needs God?

God says, I think we need some time in the valley.

So you get to know the most important peace in your life is not mountaintops, it's me.

And your relationship with me.

And it's in the valley that David got to know God as more than a third person shepherd.

Final thing I want you to see, and I shared this a couple weeks ago.

Remember, sheep are stubborn.

Sheep don't trust.

So what happens in the early days, a sheep goes, I see that you're my shepherd.

I don't trust you.

I don't think you're smarter than me.

And some sheep would be particularly rebellious.

And they would not follow their shepherd.

So what a shepherd would do, not to be cruel, he would break the leg of that sheep.

Then he would set it, and then he would carry that sheep on his shoulders over the next month.

And I got a picture of that for you.

There you go.

And what would happen is that leg was healed.

And what I'm feeling is every day he was close to the shepherd.

Every day the shepherd would talk to him.

Every day the shepherd would just chat about stuff.

And pretty soon the sheep was going, I like this guy.

You know what, this guy knows what he's doing.

And when it came time to take the splint off and put the sheep back on the ground, that sheep was the closest to the shepherd.

He never strayed because he had gotten to know the shepherd.

I think the breaking of the lamb's leg is the greatest illustration of addiction.

Because what was happening in your life?

You were saying F you to everybody.

You were rebelling.

Who needs God?

Who needs anybody?

I'm my own boss.

I'm doing it my way.

And God said, I'm going to do it my way.

And you're going to do it my way.

Let me give you this little thing called addiction.

And it's going to take you to a place where it breaks your leg.

And what will happen when your leg is broken?

You go, God, I think I need you.

And God, I need you to carry me.

And God carried you for a while.

Now some of you, maybe he didn't carry you long enough.

Because as soon as you got back on the ground, you said, okay, God, I'll take over again.

See you later.

And so you have to go through that.

And you have to go through that.

And you have to go through a few more broken legs until finally you go, I can trust this God.

He knows me.

He knows what's best for me.

He loves me and wants what's best for me.

He is a better shepherd than I am.

I love my shepherd.

And that is the beauty to me that addiction can be the worst thing in your life but the greatest blessing.

If it drives you to surrender to a loving shepherd.

Let's pray.
