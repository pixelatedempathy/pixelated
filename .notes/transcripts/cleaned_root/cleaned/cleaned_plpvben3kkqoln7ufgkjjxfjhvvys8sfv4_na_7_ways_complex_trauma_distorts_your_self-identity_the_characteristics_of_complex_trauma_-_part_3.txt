We have just got into a new series that's really a remake of an old series on the characteristics of complex trauma and the old series had 60 characteristics and we are up to over 85 characteristics of complex trauma.

Now, and what I wanted to do was just pull all of these characteristics together in a summary format so that you get the big picture of the ramifications of complex trauma.  How it affects every part of life, how we cope, how we relate, how we see yourself, our body, our immune system, our central nervous system, our brain, it's just massive.

So, we spent the first two talks talking about how it affects our body and our brain and our immune system, our central nervous system.  Today, I want to come to what I think is the aspect of complex trauma that is the most damaging, that has the most far-reaching negative effects, that is the most tragic and that is shame.  That complex trauma reshapes a child's self-identity from a positive to a negative.  No, we have done a whole series on shame and I do not want to go through it again, I just want to summarize it.

But what we are going to see is complex trauma causes shame and then shame is really where a lot of the characteristics then come from.  They are the attempt of the person to hide their shame, to compensate for their shame, to feel better about themselves together, they are all responses to shame which comes out of complex trauma.

So, this shame is just a massive thing.  The problem is, is that in our culture it's either not understood at all, not talked about a concept that's not even recognized as being important or it's misunderstood by many people.

And so, there's the majority of our culture that think they do not have shame.  When the reality is, they are full of shame, they are controlled by shame.  Shame is one of the most powerful negative influences in their life and they are not even aware of it.  The common misunderstanding around shame is that people just think of shame as an emotion and it is an emotion.

So, we hear all the time, you should be ashamed of yourself and so we immediately identify or I understand the emotion of shame.

But what I want you to understand is that emotion of shame comes out of a deeper element of shame which is it's a core belief about myself.  It's a core belief that I am not good enough, that something is wrong with me.  The next issue for many people is that shame has been confused with guilt and so they get blended together.

Now, what's important to understand is that shame and guilt overlap, they influence each other but they are very distinct.

So, the simple way to understand it is shame is about who I am, my identity.  Guilt is about what I do.

So, if I do something that violates love, I lie, I cheat, I betray somebody, then I should feel guilt.  It's a good thing.  It's something that I can then resolve and get rid of.

But shame is about who I am and it's based on lies and so the child cannot resolve it.

So, it's a very very negative destructive thing.

So, let me just again explain very briefly what shame where it comes from.  Every child comes into the world with really inherent questions that are subconscious, but they are asking, do I have value?  Do I matter?  Do I have anything to offer?  Am I lovable?  Am I desirable?  And how do they get the answers to those questions?

So, the question, do I matter?  The only way they get an answer to that is, do I matter to mum and dad?  Do I matter to you?  Am I lovable?  Am I lovable to mum and dad?  Am I lovable to you?

So, another way to look at that is the child basically sees mum and dad as mirrors, mirrors that reflect back to them who they are.

So, we think of mirrors that reflect back to us a physical picture of who we are.  That metaphor then, if you applied to mum and dad, is they reflect back a picture of who the child is as a person, their personality, their value, whether they are lovable.

So, how mum and dad treat the child, speak to the child, reflects back to the child a picture of who they are.

So, if you think of a healthy home where a child is fully authentic, mum and dad respond by accepting them, meeting their needs, connecting with them, loving them, nurturing them, what is the message that the child gets?  What does the mere reflect?  You are lovable.  You have value.  You are worth something.  The child gets a positive self-identity, but what happens in complex trauma?  The child is neglected.  The child is abused.  The child's needs are not met.  What does the child conclude?

So, they start to believe certain things.

So, the first thing they believe is, it must be my fault.  The reason mum and dad are not meeting my needs, the reason mum and dad are neglecting and abusing me is, I must be bad.  I must not be lovable.  I must not be good enough.  I must not have value.

So, all of a sudden, they are starting to believe things about themselves that are negative.

But then, it goes further.  They go to a third belief, which is, if I am authentic, I will not be good enough.  Being authentic causes you to get rejected.

So, if I am authentic, I will be rejected.

So, now, in a relationship, if anybody gets to know the true me, they will reject me.  They will not want to connect with me.

So, what you begin to see is the child, instead of developing a positive self-identity, they have developed a negative self-identity that I am not good enough.  I am not lovable.  I am not valuable.  I am less than.  I am inferior.  Anybody that gets to know me is going to neglect me, abuse me, not meet my needs, reject me.

But what I want you to see is that identity.  The child thinks is the truth.  They think that mum and dad have reflected back to them a true message about themselves.  The child cannot see that it's a lie.  That it's mum and dad that have the issues that they have great value.  They are lovable.  It's mum and dad that have some problems.

So, they base their whole identity on lies.  That's so tragic.

But then, what begins to happen is it changes the child's priorities.

So, the child comes into the world with this naturally giving authentic, loving approach to life.

Now, they still want to be giving and loving.

But the highest priority now is I got to hide myself.  I cannot be authentic.

So, the number one priority is not love now.  The number one priority is I got to hide.  I still hope I get love.  I still hope that others respect me.  I still want to love others, but it can never threaten hiding the true me.  Because if they get to know the true me, they will reject me.

So, that then leads to another priority.  In order for them to love me and respect me, I have to compensate for what I believe is the true me.  I have to become something different, something that they would respect, something that they would love, something they would like, something that will cause them to want to meet my needs and have a relationship with me.  Being authentic is the greatest crime.

So, that's shame.  That is a core identity.  And what I want you to understand is that for most people, they are not even aware of that.  It's subconscious.  It is pushed down so far, often even denied that they have any shame at all, but it controls their life.  All of their relationships, all of their interactions with people, when you start to break it down, you begin to realize it's controlled by this shame belief.  That if they get to know me, they will reject me.  As I am by myself, I am not good enough.

So, with that as kind of the overriding thing that comes out of complex trauma, all of the other characteristics I am going to give you now and the next couple weeks come out of shame.  It's an attempt of the brain to hide, to compensate for shame, to try to be good enough, to feel better about themself, to try and get their needs met.  All of these other characteristics are the brain trying to come up with solutions to the shame identity.

So, let's go into them.  Number one is I must wear masks or develop personas.

So, if anybody gets to know the authentic me, they will reject me.

So, if you look at this diagram, you have the belief of the child that the true me is bad.  It leads to rejection.

So, I must exit out or hide it.  I cannot be authentic.

So, basically, let's lose self.

Therefore, we must develop a bunch of personas around this hidden part of me that I think everybody will like, everybody will respect.  And then within their mind, they have this ideal self persona.  If only I was like this, everybody would like me, everybody would love me.

And so, in their mind, it's their only way to get love, respect, to get their needs met, to feel better about themself.  In order to feel better about myself, I must get others to feel good about me.  And then I will piggyback off their feelings of me.

So, early on, children begin to develop different roles.  Ways of behaving, patterns of behaving, that they think will get their needs met, that will maybe make dad less angry, make dad more interested in them, solve some of the problems in the family to make a more healthy family.

So, some children go to the hero.  I am going to be the perfect child.  I am going to take care of everybody's needs.  I am going to get straight A's in school.  I am going to do lots of chores.  I am going to take care of everybody.  I will be the hero.  And they do that.  And it looks like they are a wonderful child.  It looks like they do not have any issues.

But they are trying to earn love.  They are trying to get their needs met.  Some children go to the comedian or the gesture.  I will be funny all the time.  I will keep things light.  I will tell funny stories.  I will make people laugh.  Then everybody will like me.  Then there will be less anger, intention in the family.  Then if everybody likes me because I am so funny, then people will want to be my friend.  People will want to connect with me.  People will meet my needs.  People will respect me.  That's the solution to my shame, as I will become a funny man.  And if they are kind of naturally funny, and then they get validated for funny, that just sends them down that road where they have to be funny all the time.  They have got to keep things light.  You cannot get serious.  You cannot go deep.  You have got to be superficial.  Then some go to becoming the invisible child.  And that's the child that says, the way to get my needs met is to never make demands to basically be a poster child to never cause any problems, to never rock the boat, to not have any needs.  So I will hang out in my room.  I will never cause trouble.  I will never express my opinion, my needs.  I will be this invisible child which basically can become a lost child.  And so if you look at those first three, they look to be like, wow, this is a wonderful family.  This is a family where everybody's getting along.  Everybody is trying to make this family work so well.  It looks great.

But what's happening is they are all trying to conform to try to get the neglect and abuse to stop.  To get the person and authority who's abusing their authority to start being nice to them, to start meeting their needs.  And they are conforming to what they think will the person and authority wants.

But then you usually always have the fourth role.  And that's the child who refuses to conform.  Because the others are conforming, but they are also suppressing their needs.  They are also not being authentic.  They are not saying my needs matter just as much as the authorities.  They are not demanding that they be treated the same way the authority wants to be treated.

But the third one becomes known as the problem child.  They are the honest one.  They are the one that says, hey, this family's sick.  I am not going to allow you to treat me as if I do not matter.  I am going to make a noise if I am neglected or abused.  And so now what the family does is says, all of our problems are due to this child.  And they become the scapegoat.  They become the one that gets blamed for all the family's problems.  Instead of saying, you know what, I think we got a bit of a narcissist running the show in the in the authority.  That's the real problem.

But now the child gets blamed.  So those are some of the roles that get developed.  And sometimes some parents will put children into roles.  They will expect one child to be hero.  They will expect another child to be invisible.  And so a child can get forced into those roles.  Many children will try different roles and see which one suits them best.  And they are they get good at kind of jumping from role to role depending on who they are with.  That then makes them chameleons.  They can become whatever the other person needs them to be.  So what is happening here is when a child is too little to fight or flight.  So they still need mom and dad to meet their needs.  They cannot run away.  They cannot fight back.  So they have to fawn.  They go to the fourth f.  And that is kind of the ultimate survival skill, which basically is I need you to like me so that you will meet my needs.  And so what they then do is I will be whatever you want me to be.  Just love me.  Just meet my needs.  So they become highly attuned to their parents moods their parents beliefs their parents opinions.  And they adapt.  And I will become more attuned to what you need than what I need to what you believe.  I will think like you.  I do not even know what I believe.  I do not even know what I feel, but I sure know what you feel.  And I will adapt to be in every situation whatever you need me to be.  That is funny.  And that is the ultimate survival skill.  So that becomes what we know as the next characteristic is that most people with complex trauma become people pleasers.  Because for children who have got most complex trauma happens to somebody as a child.  And so they are ultimate.  They cannot fight her flight.  So they have to learn to survive.  And so fawning is I become whatever you want.  I say yes to everybody.  I do whatever everybody else is want.  I suppress my needs.  And so the brain is actually seeing the solution to the problem as let's create mirrors that actually become positive.  I think I can get these mirrors to change from neglecting me and abusing me to actually liking me.  It's all on me.  If I just do this, if I just become this, if I just give them whatever they want, if I just take care of all of their needs, if I fix all of their problems, then they will become positive mirrors who constantly reflect the positive message to me.  They are taking the weight of the world on themself to fix the family, thinking it's their problem.  If only they would do a bit more.  If only they would give their needs up a bit more, but it is all fear-based.  So let me just say this.  There's a healthy desire in every child to please.  That's wonderful.  That's their loving nature.

But this is not just a healthy desire to please.  This is now a desperation to survive.  This is a fear of getting hurt again.  So now I am pleasing not just to give with no strings attached.  Now I am pleasing, pleasing, pleasing, hoping that you will love me, hoping that you will meet my needs, hoping that you will think positively of me.  So what comes out of this shame, this mask wearing, this people pleasing is such a common problem for most people with complex trauma, and that is they do not know who they are.  I have had so many clients say to me, Tim, I am 50 years old, I do not have a clue who I am.  I have spent all my life fawning, wearing masks, adopting roles, being a chameleon, I do not have a clue who I am.  So that is a huge challenge for people in recovery.  So let me just take that characteristic and kind of go to what do I do about it?  What's the path forward in recovery to get to know who I am?  Because that's really what we want to come out of these understanding these characteristics is yes, that's an issue to be 50 years old and do not have a clue who you are.  How do I change that?  So what I want you to think about is this.  The child who's in complex trauma, they are wearing masks, they are fawning, but more than that, they are in survival mode.  And when a child's in survival mode, the focus of their brain is surviving, it's not exploring, it's not having fun, it's not going oh, I wonder what I like.  It's how do I not get hurt?  How do I get my needs met?  So when it comes to the other thing for many children in complex trauma, is they were expected to conform to being the hero child, being the invisible child, being on a path to becoming a doctor or a lawyer, to kind of fit the roles and jobs that the parents had decided the child should have.  So if they decided to pursue their interests or their passions, they got shut down for that, they got criticized for that, shame for that.  So they were not allowed to explore, they were not allowed to pursue their passions on top of having to fawn and be a chameleon.  So how does a child normally in a safe healthy environment get to know who they are?  And so this is so important to understand in recovery, you first have to have safe people who are not going to judge you, a safe environment.  What does a child do in that safe environment?  They play, they explore, they are curious.  And they try hundreds of different things, all kinds of sports, all kinds of hobbies, all kinds of different interests.  One day they want to be a doctor, one day they want to be a fireman, one day they want to be a hockey player.  They are trying all kinds of different things as they do that without fear of judgment.  They do not only see failure as a problem.  That's just part of all of this.  They get to realize what I am good at, what my talents are, what my skills are, what connects to my deepest passions, what connects to a life purpose that I want, that I did not even know I had.  And out of that, they begin to know who they are.

But think about that.  That can take 20 years.  So if you come into recovery and you do not have a clue who you are, do not expect that you are going to figure it out in a week or a month, give yourself lots of time to figure it out.

But then, with safe people and a safe non-judgmental environment, begin to explore all kinds of hobbies, all kinds of interests.  Find out what you are good at.  Find out what your passion is.  So most people, after they go through our program, they begin to have a vague sense of who their authentic self is.  It's kind of a fuzzy, blurry image, but they are starting to get a vague sense.  Over the next years, they begin to try different things.  They volunteer in different places.  They try different hobbies.  And they get a clearer and clearer picture.  One of the things that helps many people is they can take a personality test.  They start to read different books that help people understand some of their desires, some of their talents, and they begin to get a clearer and clearer picture of who they are.  So do not beat yourself up.  That you might be 50 and do not know yourself.  Just go, okay, this is where I am at.

Now, I am going to give myself permission to be a child and to begin to explore and to begin to try all kinds of different hobbies.  Now for a lot of people, this triggers another part of complex trauma, which we are going to get to later, and that is fear of failure.  So they start a new hobby, and they go, I need to do it perfectly the first time, but they cannot.  They are uncoordinated.  They make mistakes.  It's kind of awkward, and they go, oh, I quit.  No, get through that.  Get past that fear of failure.  It takes time to learn, and that's a gradual process where things are not perfect the first time.  Then you start to get a clearer, clearer picture of who you are.  And once you do, that clarifying sense of self-identity, as your shame is also healing, is so wonderful.  Something inside changes.  Something inside feels lighter.  There's a light there now that was not there before.  Okay, let's go to the next characteristic that comes out of shame.  And that is people with shame tend to judge themselves harshly.  They tend to be very hard on themself.  So if you were to get inside their brain on any given day, you would hear hundreds of messages in their brain that are criticizing everything they do that are putting themself down in every situation.  And if they fail, then they beat themself up royally.  Part of that is a belief that that's how you motivate somebody to improve is you put them down.  That comes out of their parenting.  Also part of that comes out of if I fail, then I need to serve the time.  Justice needs to be done.  I need to be punished for my crime.  And I cannot be led out of jail till I have served the time, which is I got to beat myself down for a couple days.  So if we go back to our diagram, what you have with you hide the true self, you create these personas, then you have this internal critic.  Now the internal critic is actually doing two things.  He is criticizing everything that you do because it does not match the ideal self.  Oh, you could be better.  You could have been done that better if only you had like this.  So it's constantly comparing the persona to the ideal self and constant failure.  So constant criticism, but it's also being critical by saying you are fake.  This is a false persona.  This is not the true you.  You have imposter syndrome.  If people knew the true you, they would never love you.  And so this internal critic has constant fodder to feed the mill that basically says you are phony and everything you do is never good enough.  And so this internal critic for most people with complex trauma is very loud.  It's very constant and it just constantly feeds shame.  It constantly makes them feel even worse.  It constantly seems to confirm that negative identity that they are not good enough.  And so it becomes this loop that just feeds off itself.  Now let me take you back to where some of this began.  So what happens for many children in complex trauma is they have parents who neglect them or they are critical.  They abuse them.  They are negative.  They find fault.  Whatever the child does there does not seem to be good enough.  They are constantly sending verbal and nonverbal negative messages to the child.  So what is happening in the child's brain is they are absorbing those messages.  They are believing those messages.  And they are developing an internal parent in their brain, the IP.  That is basically parenting what their actual parents say and how they act toward them.  That's basically shame.  And so that internal parent just expresses the shame belief.

But then there's another piece to this and that is this usually happens gradually.  So let me give you an example.  So the child is crying and parents get frustrated with the crying and saying big boys do not cry.  That's so weak.  Go to your room and do not come out to you.  Stop crying or if you are going to keep crying and I punish you for give you something to cry about.  And so all of a sudden crying to them is such a weakness.  It causes them to get hurt and punished and shamed.  And so they hate that weak part of themself that they are so that they cry so much that they are so sensitive.  And so now they go I hate this part of myself.  Let's lock it away.  Then they get told they are too fat.  I hate that I am fat.  I hate my body.  Then they get told that they are too angry.  I hate that I am too angry.  Then they get told they are too sensitive.  I hate that I am too sensitive.  So gradually piece by piece of their personality, they develop a greater negativity towards it.  So now they hate their body.  They hate their personality.  They hate their emotions.  They hate their skills.  And they are trying to hide more and more of themself and replace it with a mass that they think will gain them acceptance.

But there's more and more of themself that they do not like.  So shame just has grown gradually through childhood.

But also the internal parent has found more and more things to be negative about in themself.  And that is what has happened inside a child.  What is so important to understand moving forward is there have been a whole bunch of tests that have been done to basically figure out what is it that is the best long lasting motivation that brings about long lasting change in growth in people.  For people from complex trauma, they thought it would be critical shame the person.  And what they found is that that brought about some short term improvement.

But if they kept getting criticized, if they kept getting shamed after a while, it actually made things worse.  The child gave up growing, they felt hopeless.  What brought about long lasting growth and healing and change self-compassion?  What I want you to understand is what is actually needed to grow is the exact opposite remedy that shame has produced.  Shame has produced shame and criticize and be hard on yourself.  When the actual remedy, the actual healthy solution is be kind to yourself.  To a person who's always been hard on themself, that feels wrong.  That feels weak.  That feels like how can that produce any good results.  So you have to work through what feels very wrong, it feels weird, it feels awkward, it feels like you are being soft, but that is the path to healing.  The next one, and that is shame basically says I do not have value.  So I do not want to feel that way.

I want to feel valued.  I want others to value me.  So I must gain value somehow.  I do not feel I have it inherently.  I must earn it.  I must gain it through externals.  So let me show how this develops with shame.  So what a child then will do is look for ways that cause them to feel they have value.  So they compare themselves to others.  And they find kind of an arena where they seem to compete better based on kind of what culture values.  So if they are very pretty, and they go, wow, I am prettier than everybody in this class and culture values prettiness, then that's what gives me value is my prettiness.  And then if they get validated from others that, wow, you are pretty, then they go the whole basis of my value now is my prettiness, my beauty.  Or then as they develop my body, or how good I am in bed, my ability sexually, that's what gives me value.  Or my brains, I am smarter than everybody.  I get awards, I get recognized.  So everything is on my ability to use my brains.  That's what gives me value.  Or I am very talented in sports.  I am very talented in music.  I am very talented in acting.  So everybody's validating that they are respecting me because of my talent.  So my talent is what gives me value.  Or my accomplishments, I am a hard worker.  I can produce a lot of positive things and accomplish a lot of stuff.  And people respect me for that and like me for that.  So my accomplishments based on my constant hard work is what gives me value.  Or if I get positions where I have power, then I have value.  So I need to work towards significant positions.  Or if I have lots of possessions, that must prove that I significant.  So I need big house, big car, lots of toys.  That's what's going to give me possessions.  Or I am going to be part of a culture or religion that says if you act a certain way that's proper, that's sophisticated, that's spiritual, then you are going to get respected.  Then you are going to be better than everybody else.  All of those it's trying to gain value and therefore solve shame.  Some people go to the other extreme and they go, well, I cannot compete in the brains.  I cannot compete in the body.  I cannot compete in the possessions.

But I am going to be the baddest of the bad.  And that's going to get me respect from certain people.  That's where my value will come from.  So they are trying to solve shame by gaining all of their value through externals since they do not feel they have anything internally.  And it's all based on comparing themself with others.

But do you realize what comes out of that?  What happens if a prettier girl comes to school?  Now I feel insecure.  Now I see that person as the enemy as a threat.  Now I must prove that I am prettier than them.  Now I must put them down somehow to reestablish that I am superior, my dominance.  Now I must always point out the flaws in others.  It sets up an unsafe society.  It sets up a deep insecurity and always needing to prove something all the time.

The next thing that happens for a lot of children in complex trauma is they head down a direction of gaining value based on the first thing that their parents or relatives or friends validated about them.  So if they were told they were funny.  Oh, you are so funny.  All of a sudden they are heading down that road.  And that's my sense of value.  That's where it comes from.  So I am going to be the funniest around.  I am going to be funny all the time.  Or if they got told you are so pretty.  And that was constantly the focus every time people met them.  Wow, you are so pretty.  Then that became the focus of their life.  Then other children every time they help somebody.  Oh, you are such a helpful person.  And then the people that they helped they go, oh, thank you so much.  You are such a wonderful person.  And so now their value comes from helping people.  Others, you are so sacrificing.  You are always giving.  You never make demands.  You never express your needs.  You never push.  You just give, give, give.  Wow, you are just a saint.  They go, wow, okay, then I am going to never have needs.  I am just going to give and sacrifice constantly because that's what gives me my value.  Or others, all of a sudden seem to realize that they gain value every time they were sick.  So mom and dad neglected them normally.

But when they were sick or they had a problem, mom and dad came rushing in gave them all kinds of attention.  All of a sudden they were super valuable.  So if they are in pain, if they are sick, if they are in need, that's the way to gain value.  Many as soon as they got a job, then they got status.  They got money.  They got recognition.  People noticed them.  So their whole value came from their career.  Problem is when they lose their career, when they retire, then who am I?  Where does my value come from?  So what comes out of all of these things, what I am wanting you to see is in a healthy home, a child is able to be a human being.  Their value comes from just being.  It's inherent.  Complex trauma, you have to become a human doer.  All your value comes from externals by you doing something.  That is the wrong way to approach value.

But that is what they think is their only option.

Let me add a couple others.  Some people lived with shame for so long and then they become a parent.  And all of a sudden they have a little life that adores them, a little life that wants them, a little life that they feel such love for.  They realize this child is totally dependent on them and that gives them a sense of value.  And so the solution in their brain is I need to be a parent.  I always have to have my child dependent on me.  I need to create a relationship with my child where they are not actually allowed to grow up and become independent of me.  They always need to depend on me in some way.  And then others, they just go, I need validation.  I need others to notice me.  That will give me a sense of some value.  So they begin to pursue the spotlight to try to get others to notice them.  They begin to tell sensational stories.  They, whenever anybody shares something with them, they share a one-up story to try to look a little bit more impressive than everybody else.  They tell you regularly about all of their accomplishments.  Just hoping people will go, wow, you are impressive.  They are longing for value.

Let me add one final one that comes out of shame.  And that is, they isolate and build walls.  So the ultimate way to hide shame, to hide my authentic self is to isolate.

But to understand isolation, there's geographic isolation and there's internal isolation through building walls around your heart.  So some people go to geographical isolation.  They withdraw from people.  They convince themselves that they do not need anybody.  And they kind of live all by themselves alone, self-sufficient, and really do not have relationships.  So some go that route.

But most, they go to building walls around their heart.  And these can be people who have tons of superficial friends.  They are very sociable.  They can be the life of the party.  They are just constantly surrounded by people.

But nobody's getting close to them.  Nobody's going to get to know the real them.  They are not going to reveal who they really are to anybody.  They are going to let people know them to a degree.

But then there, that was people are going to bump into a wall.  Those people are going to try to get to know them better, but are not going to be able to do that.  So let me take this back to develop it a little bit farther.  Because there's another piece that happens with this isolation.  So in complex trauma, one way to understand it is the child is desperately trying to connect with mom and dad.

But for some reason, they cannot have secure attachment with mom and dad mom and dad neglect them abuse them.  They are too busy.  So there's insecure attachment.  The child concludes it's my fault.  So shame develops.  The child then says I must hide my authentic self.  I must isolate from people because I am bad.  Anybody gets to know me.  He's going to reject me.  So I am going to prevent that from happening by just isolating from people.  That's going to be the best way to hide.

But what then is happening inside the child because of shame is I do not even want a relationship with myself.  So it's not just about me avoiding relationships with others and isolating from them.  I do not even like me.  So I am going to isolate from myself.  I am going to abandon myself.  So mom and dad kind of abandoned me.  That's what it felt like because they did not want to connect with me.  So if they did not want to connect with me and abandon me, well, I am going to abandon myself.  And so there's this self-abendiment that begins to happen.  And as a result of that, is there's a deep loneliness that sets in.  A deep feeling of not belonging, of not fitting in.  So these people can be in a crowd where everybody's laughing at their stories, but they do not feel they belong.  They feel very alone.  And what happens for so many people with that is it leads to addiction.  There's such a deep emptiness, a deep loneliness.  They have to medicated.  They have to try to fill it with something that makes them feel a little bit better.  And so it leads to addiction, but it leads to from any to deep depression, to mental health issues because they have abandoned themselves.  There's a deep, deep loneliness.  So what I want you to see is this isolation, this deep loneliness is really about deep shame that came out of lack of connection.  The brain was trying to protect the child from getting hurt.  And so what it thought was just isolate.  That's the best way to protect the child, but it actually made things worse.  What you have to understand is the brain was trying to protect the child from unsafe people.  To continue to live in isolation is hurting you.  What you are trying to protect yourself from is unsafe people.

But what you need is connection with safe people, but your brain fears anybody I try to connect with, I am going to get hurt.  And what you have to fight against is I need connection.  It's a key factor to my healing, to a healthy meaningful life.  I have to find safe people.  It's going to get scary because I am going to be afraid this can play out like it always has, but it always was unsafe people.  So with safe people, it should be a different outcome.  I have to trust that even though I am feeling fear.  If I stay in continued isolation, it's just going to lead me to darker and darker places.  So those are some of the characteristics that come out of complex trauma.  Next time we will look at a bunch more characteristics that come out of complex trauma and shame.  Thank you.
