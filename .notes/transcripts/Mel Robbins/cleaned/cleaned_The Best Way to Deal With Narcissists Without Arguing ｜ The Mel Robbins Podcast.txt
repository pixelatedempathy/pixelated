People on the internet are diagnosing other people with narcissism.  What you are here to say is that this is a personality style that is maladaptive, that hurts other people.  Setting boundaries with narcissistic people is akin to hugging a porcupine.  Show me a 35-year-old narcissist and I will show you someone who is horrible as a teenager.  Show me someone who is horrible as a teenager, I do not know if they are going to be narcissistic when they are 35.  You want a clear-cut answer?  There's not one.  Try that with a narcissist.  Call me up.

Let me know how that works.  Hey, it's your buddy Mel.  And this weekend, my husband and I are going to go to this function.  And I do not want to get too specific because I do not want a particular person to know that I am talking about them.

But we are going to this function this weekend where there's going to be a particular person.  And honestly, the person's really hard to deal with.  Like it's always about them.  They hate it when things do not go their way.  And how do you know that?  Because they either erupt or they stir the pot or they are constantly like making trouble or they are sulking in the corner, like trying to draw the attention to them.  And here's the other thing about this person and their personality.  They do not have any interest in anyone but themselves.  Unless, of course, they need something from you.  And then, of course, you are the first person that they are going to call.

Now, I have been.  I bet you have got someone or maybe many people like this in your life too.  They never ask you a single question about your life.  It's like it does not even occur to them.  And it's not like it has to be about me all the time.

But it's so clear when you are around this person that it's always about them.  Is this ringing any bells for you?  Maybe it's your brother.  Maybe it sounds like I am describing your boss or your dad.  Maybe it's your brother.  Maybe it's your dad or your mom.  Maybe it's the person that your sister is now dating.  I mean, you cannot quite put your finger on it.

But something is off.  And you always know that any time that you are going to have to spend the weekend with them or be in a meeting with them or have a family dinner with them, you are going to leave and you are going to feel drained.  You are going to feel slightly annoyed by simply having had to be around them.  That's my weekend plan.

Now, do you have that person in mind?  Do you know how to deal with them?  Do you know how to protect yourself from this kind of personality where it's always about them?  No matter what, they always bring it back to them.  Well, that's what you and I are going to talk about today.  And we are not just going to talk about this particular personality type.  You are going to get a playbook of tactics, strategies, do's, and you are definitely getting the do nots, things to say, things not to say, so that the next time, you are about to be with somebody who's literally all about themselves, you know exactly what to do.

So, you too.  You love her.  You know her.  It's Dr.  Romney.  And so let's jump to our studios in Boston where we tape this conversation.  I am just going to start firing them away.  And there are some amazing questions here.  So this is a great question.  We got this one a lot.  What is the difference between a narcissist and someone with an inflated ego?  So when we talk about narcissism and it's something I have talked to you before, Okay.  A carrot is not soup.  A carrot is an ingredient in soup.  An inflated ego is just a part of the larger spectrum of narcissism, which also includes things like variable empathy, entitlement, arrogance, grandiosity, the need for admiration and validation, envying other people, the need for control on and on and on and on.  A person with an inflated ego, am I willing to take the bet that they are narcissistic?  Sure.

But I am not sure I am going to move all my chips to the middle.  I am going to move all my chips to the table.  One of the things that you said in the first episode that we did with you was you made a distinction between somebody who's annoying and that's someone with an inflated ego versus somebody who is narcissistic, who is harmful.  Yes, that's it.  It's the harmful part.  And I think that that's a key element because I think by definition, if a person really does have the whole constellation of stuff you need to have to be narcissistic, inflated ego is definitely part of it.

But there are people out there who have these big inflated egos.

But they are actually kind of these also can be very teddy bear ish.  They sound they almost sound like I do not know, like circusy people like I am the best.  I am the greatest.  Come here.  Give me a hug.  I think you are so great, too.  And they are actually very sweet and present.  So it's a that's why I am saying you cannot assume.  Do they tend to go together?  Like it's a bet, right?  Do I if I see inflated ego, am I willing to bet that this horse might be narcissistic?  Sure.  You know, one thing I want to do to defend you is that this person had asked, are we mistaking person?  Ality traits with the clinical diagnosis.  You have been very vocal in your work about saying this is a personality style, and that people on the Internet are diagnosing other people with narcissism.  Correct.  And the other thing to keep in mind is that the second that you click on a tiktok video or an Instagram real that is about narcissism.  You are going to see more of it.  What you are here to say is that this is a personality style and that it is critical that you recognize the signs of it because it is a personality style that maladaptive that hurts other people and i learned that in the first episode we did with you that we will link to this one is it best to leave my narcissistic husband or stay for the sake of my children my seven-year-old is terrified of my husband when he rages i do not think it's best for me to remain but i am wondering if i should wait until they are older or grown to leave this is this is this right here is the question of all survivors who are in a situation like this rageful narcissist likely not a good parent child is scared of them but then there is that big thing called family court and the one thing the narcissistic person knows well is how to punish you now once they figure out that messing with custody is going to destroy your soul they are going all in and most judges in this country will award 50 to the other parent if they ask for it which is a lot of time spent away from the parent who's the healthier parent and this is what people going to do is they are going to be the one who's going to be the one who's going to be the one who grapple with and here's what's so challenging mel this is one of those cases where i am not going to be able to give a good answer because you are at the crossroads where you either get the divorce deal with the custody set up know that there's times your child is alone with that parent that they are scared of okay or you stick it out some parents get solace from knowing their presence so at least they can run interference for that child with this toxic parent they might wait until the child they feels like more able to sort of autonomously make needs known there is no right answer here some of this is going to come down to money you know are you going to be able to secure housing for you and your child and your children the way you want getting access to mental health for that child while before before you ever make a decision on a divorce is crucial because i can promise you this once that marriage splits and you do not make a divorce that's not your decision that's your child's decision and you do not make make the proper stipulations in the parenting agreement that parent will stop therapy i see this happen over and over again they insist on two-party consent for things like mental health services and then the narcissistic parent will not sign it's back to court back to court back to court so get that child into therapy while you only need the signature of one parent because you are both still married get your ducks in line talk to a divorce attorney pay whatever they charge for an hour go in there prepared tax returns whatever you need and ask them what am i looking at what are the laws of this state because they are different in every state what am i looking at with custody what am i looking at with money i think the problem is is that too many people do not go into this conversation prepared marriage is a legal contract make no mistake people read their rental car contracts more carefully than they understand exactly what the hell they are getting into when they marry someone and so figure this out even if you are not going to get divorced for 10 years getting that clear feedback from a divorce attorney makes a huge difference in your decision making when i read a message like this this is the first time somebody vocalizes that they are considering leaving i know that they are on their way out it may take five years it may take eight years they might even wait till that child's 18th birthday which i cannot tell you how many people i know waited till midnight on their child's 18th birthday and then they started the process by that next day they had filed for divorce no custody i have to be honest with you i really wish you were going to say get out now no because never i i know i am just being honest because i you want a clear-cut i know answer there's not one there's not the systems do not allow it now family court is one of the most abusive systems in this country there are people involved in court reform the stuff they bring to me i am thinking this is not in the best interest of the child if you get unlucky with the judge you are screwed well and also i think all of us have some friend or family member that is not a good friend or family member and i think that's what i am trying to get at i am trying to get at that but i think that's what i am trying to get at i am trying to get at that and i think that's what i am trying to get at i am trying to get at that and i think that's what i am trying to get at watching a divorce play out a decade later constantly going back into court because it's a way for somebody with a narcissistic personality style punishing to continue punishing and being in control it's called post-separation abuse it's a formal thing post-separation they keep going and going and going but i will say this and something i tell many many parents a mistake they make i think too many people are like i am going to fight for my child no matter what and the narcissistic person grabs on to that and like oh is that your weak point but if you i i remember once coaching a woman and she wanted to play this whole mother lioness thing i am like slow it down and instead when she was at they were having one of these many hearings they would go through she said you know i am i this this and she was dying inside at the agreement that was coming down the pike and she said okay that's great you know what actually these alternate weekends this is going to work great for me because there are so many friends and i am going to fight for my child and i am going to fight for my child and i am going to fight for my child and i am going to fight for my child and i am going to fight for my child i have been wanting to connect with and i have been you know i have been wanting to get back into some of this you know the hiking and climbing i was doing this is actually i am going to really use the weekends well you know that fool he's like what yes no no do not think you are just going to no no no wait wait and so when she when it got framed as you know that's she was totally cool at it you know she said totally fine get it i am actually this this is great i mean it's good to know this because you know i have been wanting to do this stuff and pursue this and you know so i will be using that time well and i am sure the kids can break up over time and you know what's the point the kids will love spending time with you and by the time the whole thing was done 80 20 instead of the 50 50.  Well you are just hammering one message strategy strategy strategy acceptance of what it is you are never changing this it's only going to get worse you got to accept it you got to be strategic how do you deal with a narcissist who will not accept your boundaries my mom is a narcissist and whenever i try to set a boundary she will act receptive or understanding at first then an hour or two later she will change her mind reject my boundary request unfortunately the minute you disagree with her or upset her she tries to quote punish you by cutting you out of her life right so setting boundaries with narcissistic people is akin to hugging a porcupine it's really a bad idea and it's a fool's errand right i am tired of people giving guidance to people like set boundaries wait why are not we supposed to not with narcissists you set them with everybody else but this is a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is it's a pointless endeavor and all it does is create more friction in this create more friction in this kind of drama this person's having kind of drama this person's having with their mother who is silent treatmenting and being sullen and all these other things with their mother who is silent treatmenting and being sullen and all these other things so when this idea of setting boundaries with a narcissistic person i always say it's an inside job and where you are there if you say to them i do not want you to talk about this i do not want you to come this you are basically inviting them to do that thing because they know they can mess with you all right so unless you want to spend the remainder of your time on this planet getting unless you want to spend the remainder of your time on this planet getting into a power struggle with them which i just said you cannot win your better bet is to set an internal boundary which is i now know that these topics are off limits i know that if i invite this person to this event this is going to happen so i am going to have to figure out an alternative i know if i make a reservation with them for dinner they are going to show up 25 minutes late so i need to make a reservation at that place that seats us when we are not yet a complete party some people say well you are enabling the narcissist you are actually not because there's no setting a boundary with them and you want to have the dinner and you may have to invite them but at least y'all can start eating and when they come in and say how dare you start with us we said that we said to come at seven you did not come at seven they seated us we started eating you set a boundary i love that distinction because you are right when you say i am going to set a boundary with somebody who's narcissistic it implies that you are going to tell them about it yes versus you are just saying just just understand the situation for what it is understand the person is not changing recognize the patterns and set sort of this boundary with yourself like for me the one that i have in my life with a particular person is it's a three-night limit that's right because exactly by day four this person gets prickly so you mel you would never say to that person we have a three-night limit no oh my god but that would be this that what a lot of people say well like if a person is saying things that offend you you need to say that thing you are saying is offending me tiger's cage try that with the narcissist call me up let me know how that works yes and like i also do not set the boundaries that are like i do not talk about politics with you because you are an absolutely irrational freak that then dominates the conversation if anybody asks a question or tries to offer a different point of view i set a boundary with myself i get up from the table i do not engage that's right that you do not engage because i know exactly what's about to happen i have no hope of it being different i have accepted it i set the boundary i do not engage in this stuff i remove myself that's a boundary not what this this poor person unfortunately is trying to do the impossible with the mother and will be forever disappointed right because if you go mom let's not talk about why you do not want to talk about politics because you know like that yes we all know how that goes yes got it internal boundaries only i say boundaries are an inside game i love that oh my child is a narcissist teenager how can i help them okay so let's first of all let's always slow our roll when we are using the word narcissism and teenager okay by definition adolescence is a phase of life where the child is going through something called separation and individuation adolescents are tough right they are mean to their parents and often quite lovely with their peers and there's a reason for that the separation individuation process means that the peers are more of a meaningful social reference point so they will actually be lovely with their peers listen to their problems pick them up late at night bring them soup when they are sick and scream at you who even dare mention emptying the dishwasher and there's a there's a common sort of therapist talk is that an adolescent is often going through a phase we call shitting the nest shitting the shitting the nest and if they ship the nest and it's a lot easier for everyone to say get out and for the kid to leave like this is gross I do not want to be here so all that mean behavior is sometimes part and parcel of shitting the nest so we have to be able to figure out if it's that narcissism is a story that can be told beautifully backwards but it's very difficult to tell forwards and in real time with an adolescent for example what I mean is show me a 35 year old narcissist and I will show you someone who was horrible as a teenager show me someone who is horrible as a teenager I do not know if they are good at this I do not know if they are good at this I do not know if they are going to be narcissistic when they are 35 really the frontal lobes are continuing to develop a lot of that kind of lack of social awareness impulsivity all that sitting up here that part does not fully cement and set until around 25 26 27 years old adolescents really if you want to look at it developmentally does not matter that they can drive and vote and buy alcohol it really is it goes until about 25 26 that's when adulthood starts so I would say to people of narcissistic adolescents white-knuckle white-knuckle this a bit have whatever limits you need in your household be realistic about them remember the concept of shitting the nest and put a pin in it for about eight years and then revisit so let's just kind of unpack this a little bit because I am sure there's a ton of you that are listening right now that are like whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa but what if I am seeing narcissistic traits yes because one of the things that you have okay well let me just stop right there because you just said you probably are what you are saying is that the very natural normal and mentally healthy process of a teenager separating from their parents is for them to become more egotistical correct more demonstrative more selfish and to prioritize old entitled however if you are seeing that and you are concerned and maybe you are concerned because you are in a family system where grandparents are narcissistic or you have an ex who is narcissistic so you do have some concern is there something that you can model that helps to keep somebody on a adaptive personality track versus spinning into more of a maladaptive or are you basically saying there's really not much you can do but white-knuckle yourself or you want to be sure yes figure out how your kids are behaving with their peers because if they have healthy peer relationships that seem reciprocal that seem mutual that they you know that the can use everything to change the outras whether and Но d'accord d'accord je Rhonda okay cool perfect so Zack we are pretty much there so you can take that and Cal Contかった guess they are able you really should take a look at life and their lives yes and by naturally convinced to be more of a過來 whoever the person towards which I think they are most able to be more of a part of more highly responsible relationships yes yes I think putting people who have had niño and gleich they can be qualified Oh because they can move able to be이다 sure yes there would you take out all theuary what about behavior sister drug abuse nature harmony if it's true Ya 25%mayın입 it I would not so much leader but the 一%jours I you are much more likely to be dealing with narcissism.  Does that make sense?  That makes a lot of sense.  And is there anything, if you are seeing that, that you can do, or is this already just a bed that's made?  It's a tough one at that point.  I think that it is not getting into a power struggle with them becomes crucial.  Because if indeed you have got this difficult across the board, difficult with the teachers, difficult with you, difficult with peers, kind of kid, difficult in their part-time job, whatever, getting into a power struggle with them, you are going to lose it.  You are not going to win because no one can win a power struggle with someone who's narcissistic.  And with an adolescent, that's going to be even more amped up because they do not feel a sense of power because they are still living in your good graces and all of that.  So do not get into a power struggle.  Basically, do not let the dishwasher be the hill you die on because it's really not worth it, right?

But it's because where narcissism is in adolescents, other bad behaviors are also likely to hang out, including things like substance use.  And so what you really do want to watch for is actually keep more of an eye on, is your kid safe?  How is their mental health functioning in other areas?  If you are able to encourage therapy, that kid's probably going to say no, it's worth a shot.  Definitely figure out what it is that does speak to them and cultivate their interest in that.  Because if there's something that they like, maybe it's music, maybe it's a form of social media, maybe it's a form of social media, maybe it's a form of sports, maybe whatever it is, show some interest in what they do.  Because we can get so caught up in the power struggle of you are going to empty the dishwasher if it's the last thing you do versus who is this kind of difficult kid of mine.

But we get so caught up in the difficult of it all, we do not pay attention to like, what do they like?  So you might see them playing a video game, right?  Instead of like, oh, these kids and their video games, it's, you never empty the dishwasher, all you do is play the video games.  Like, what's this game about?  Like, what, talk to me about, I am just curious.

Now, you probably get a lot of questions about this, but I am just curious.  So what do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?  What do you do?

But you never know.  Well, I think it gets in there.  I think you pull a chair up and you just sit next to them.  And you just sit by them while they are playing the video game.  And even just doing that shows a level of interest.  And so I love that advice.  Is there any way for a narcissist to find true love with a partner?  I mean, like a personality type that a narcissist could be with, where both people are happy?  So now we get into philosophy, right?  What is love?  Is there a universal definition?  And the problem is, no, there's not.  I think probably the most powerful thing people could do by their third date, I wish, you know how you go to the doctor, they make you sign the informed consent?  Yes.  I wish we had that for love.  Say, put your piece of paper in front of someone, this is my definition of love.  Because their definition of love is very transactional.  And they are not aware of what their definition of love.  Their definition of love is basically, I am going to swallow you up whole.  You are going to be for me.  It's a very romantic, passionate definition of love.  What they are not good at is long term companionate love.  So this idea of true love, right, with all the depth that's implied, the mutuality, the reciprocity, the better or worse, the standing at someone's side, even when they get older or need care or need help, or, you know, are more starting to get more successful than you all the things that would throw a narcissistic person off.  I would say the short answer to that question is, I am going to swallow you up whole.  I am going to throw you upwards whole.  And then having lived, accepting, loving yourself and the 내� Straßen Cecil which was what we had in terms of ס fashioned at that time which is now part of our Foreign дIst repeating what we hare looking for.  And gets a flavor we call it are in other words like commitment conscious this is why you see again when he when a person who has been through a 30-year marriage with kids then trades in for a 27 year old partner and they are 60 what exactly are they talking are they talking about if y'all did not watch the same shows in high school you got nothing to talk about you know based on everything that you have taught us and that i have learned from your work when i read between the lines of this question which i probably should not is there any way for a narcissist to find true love i imagine somebody who is holding out hope that there could be a possibility or fear or fear that the narcissist will go on and find true love with someone new because that's the big fear of people who are left so the narcissistic person you are with someone yes narcissistic person leaves they find new supply right immediately right okay and you are of course going through a real grief process so you are struggling with it the big fear is now they found their new preиса a decision and well the big fear is that they can do it again and they figure it out when she finds her and that means this is what I loose hope so that that's very much important because then what happens is according to people like me in our decisions so it's also people are complaint immediate right okay and you are of course going through a real grief process so you are struggling with it the big fear is now they found their new person are they going to change for the new person are they going to be better for the new person are they going to find true love for the new person that's how i read that question and the answer that's no i watched someone go through this a couple years ago had a very up and down narcissistic relationship with someone went on for years yada yada and then they break up and inside of a few months he meets someone new soulmate soulmate soulmate jimmy bing bing bing alarm signs and they get engaged in like two months right and the the person was still struggling like was having trouble meeting people and you know was just sort of having a dark night of the soul and this person seems like they moved on but and it was of little solace to this person who was sort of left that this is not and there's no depth this is all performative for narcissistic people love is performative and this is where the social media has changed things right because the performative love relationship is very much a stage and is going to be a stage where you are going to have to keep changing the social media staple of Instagram look how happy we are look how cute we are we are van lifing we are traveling we are so great in love my lovey bear lovey never in my life could there be a hero like you you are my love hero and then these fools break up in three months nobody goes from love hero to broken up like this whole thing was a lie so it's again every therapist knows the more they gush about the relationship on social media the more it's a train wreck and so it's performative Dr Romani how do I deal with a narcissistic adult son who uses our grandchildren as leverage for the silent treatment blame and manipulation so this is a very common dynamic and I am so glad someone's asking about this so you have a narcissistic adult child fully grown obviously has you know gotten into a relationship has kids all of that right the grandchildren become the greatest thing that you can do for the relationship that's what I am talking about so I am talking about the greatest leverage of all leverage on the planet and this is devastating for parents who and on multiple levels number one because it's narcissism is a developmental state many parents will say what did I do wrong am I partly responsible for this and it's particularly devastating if you did co-parent that child with a narcissist and you did your very best you might have even been that co-parent who actually protected your kid but could not get out of there so there may be two ways of doing it one is staying like a sort of respect parent as a parent then another is staying at the mercy of that personality you know with your child and then even is a little bit more reductive and multi-level parent you are just part of the same family everyone can just set up their own life you know you can kind of kind of get along well with your grand�� or a working relationship you would have to never stop you know stay as a scored baby or anything like that you need to basically bring both of those responsibilities into you there's always those further episodes and there is always times where there's this real possibility of a family growth where immediately you are just having to sit down as son recognizes that they have basically got you over a barrel.  It's the ultimate tool of manipulation.  With narcissistic people, the struggle is that it's very easy to create the monster by giving into them, right?  They get used to it.  And what we do is we have to ask ourselves from a radical acceptance standpoint.  In fact, something I talk about in the book is something called a person's true north, right?  That your true north is how I always tell people do not engage with the narcissist.  It's going to get you nowhere.  Simple answers, disengage, disengage, disengage, right?

But the concept of your true north is the one time you will take the fight, right?  Whatever that might be.  It might mean the workaround you will do.  It might be the argument you might have.  It might be the tiger's cage you are willing to go into because it might be about, you might be willing to take the fight for your kid or your grandkid.  You might be willing to take the fight because somebody is saying something that's so noxious to you.  It's racist.  It's not your kid.  It's your grandkid.  It's your grandkid.  It's your grandkid.  It's your racist or some form of bias or something like that.  In this particular case, this grandparent has to assess the true north of their grandchildren because the fact is, odds are that it's basically an extortionate setup, right?  To see the grandchildren, they have to do the dance dictated by their son.  And so the radical acceptance may very well be that there are times they may not always get to see these grandchildren and the grief that goes with that.  It's figuring out the true north.  Maybe the birthday party is your everything.  So that might mean, it's almost like a negotiation.  You are going to give in on certain things with this son if there's something you can do.  So you can be at the true north of the birthday party or the graduation or having them, you know, going on the vacation with them or not.  So you have to, it becomes a constant calibration to where do I want to see these kids?  Where am I willing to relent?  Because he's forever going to have you over a barrel.  So it's also, if this person does a fully radically accept.  Their son's behavior, they may still be trying to change their son's behavior.  They may have hope for change.  You are going to have to eradicate that.  In many ways, their son has been brought down to nothing more than the portal to those grandchildren.  So instead of putting behavioral standards on the son who is narcissistic, they have to figure out what the ritualistic dance they need to do is to go through the portal to see the grandkids.  Gotcha.  And so the radical acceptance there is really just understanding this is what it is.  This is what it is.  And I can hate the dance I have to do.  I can hate the kind of hoops I have to jump through.

But it's more important to me because I value a relationship with these grandkids and I understand this is the access point.  Right.  And it could very well be, we do not know this because they did not make it clear in the question.  They may be talking to their son as though they think he's listening to them like a normal person would.  A mistake a lot of people make with narcissistic people is they actually try to appeal to some sensitivity in them.  Like, we love your son.  We love your children so much.  We would do anything for them.  Like we blah, blah, blah, save you the money on the babysitter, blah, blah, blah.  We will do anything.  And so you, you know, do you, cannot you see how much we care about them?  Dada, dadada, we have made trust funds.  Whatever the hell it is people are saying about the grandkids.  They are not listening.  You are not, you know, they are not going to pay attention.  All they see is that I have got the ultimate tool here to get what I need from these people.  I am not going to be a good father.  I am not going to be a good mother.  I am going to be a good father.  I want a child who canangi me will not do it.  All they want to do is do it.  We do not know what happens if their home owner does a fadal rule that they are be like, well, I do not have money.  You know, you can only sitting on my milkshake, drinking my milk.  Sure enough you go to the influence bank.  Okay.  And their mom and sigma make them comfortable with it.  That's just what they do.  They call the fchar in there and they go and get us something that I can mortgage out.  She said it was a hope.  So with that the, with that that love and trust the Superior.  That's �р еpjер с regulation, laffawa y gixold ahgauьkaahagdecilro ahahra, th praeikher eilaalahxehg задачk could tell you some of the stories I have seen with the way adult narcissistic children have completely plowed through their parents' money and really put their parents in a precarious spot.  I am not saying that's the case in this one, but you have got to be careful of all these angles.  And if this son, for example, is at all trying to get into the family's money, in some ways, it almost becomes a pay to play.  Whatever you are paying to do, you know, to play, you have got to be aware of that.  Well, I think if somebody is willing to use innocent kids as human capital to manipulate adults to get what you want, that seems a lot more egregious than manipulating you to get your money.  You know, I have seen this question a lot in the form of how do I deal with the fact that my adult child is now married to or engaged to somebody who's narcissistic?  And that new partner is turning them against us.  Yes.  And this feels like it's similar, but how do you counsel parents that recognize that this is actually what's happening?  We had a great relationship with our adult child.  Now they are in a relationship with somebody else.  It feels like that person is turning our child against them.  How do you counsel somebody in that situation?  Is it the same thing?  No, it's different, right?  Because in the case, of the narcissistic son, they are sort of a direct line to the son, right?  They have known the son his whole life.  You know, who knows what historically has happened.  They may, you know, may very well be that they are like, yes, we dropped the ball when he was little.  And now we have been trying to make amends ever since.  And now that he's got kids and we want access to the kids, we actually, in some ways, it's like it's the spoiled child phenomenon.  They are doing anything the son wants.  That's their own kid.

Now, if you have a kid that's yours and you have a great relationship with them into adulthood, your kid is not narcissistic, right?

But they, they meet someone narcissistic.  That's a very different situation because you know your kid has the apparatus, the solid apparatus of goodness, whatever that, you know, at least to be a, have a mutual and reciprocal relationship with you.  So the big mistake people will say, especially when your child is in love with someone and is about to get married and is in sort of the, you know, that sort of blissy state that you say, I am worried that they are narcissistic, is the biggest mistake you could make.  You never want to do that.  You want to, you want to try to illuminate the patterns without saying like what he said was toxic or that was not okay, but rather dropping in the lines in the water, like things like, hey, you okay?  Like we are not hearing from you as much.  Is everything okay now?  You might hear them say like, gosh, what's wrong with you?  Like I have my own life now.  Say, no, no, no, I hear that.  Like I just, I completely understand that you want to, you want to keep feeling it out, feeling it out.  There's actually, we can take a page out of the playbook of what happens to people when family members recognize if one of their, for a child or family members in a cult.  Dr.  Yanya Lalich, she talks about doing something called breaking the shelf.  Okay.  What she means is that when you have a family member who goes into a cult, you cannot say, yo, you are in a cult.  Because they are going to say, no, I am not.  This is my group of healing friends that want to self-develop together, right?  And they are going to say, they totally do not want to do that.  They are going to say, you told me you would say this.  I knew it to hell with you.  And the cult's going to want them to cut that parent off.  Right.  So what she says is you need to do is you want to break the shelf.  And what that means is remind them of the life they had before the cult.  So it's gentle conversations like, oh my gosh, you are not going to believe this.  You remember how you love to surf?  You know, I was, it's so weird.  I was just driving down that, you know, the old street, that street.  And you know, he, he made this, the surfboard shop so much bigger.  Like how, how are you doing?  Like, how's this?  Surfing going, you are planting or you are not surfing anymore.  Are you kind of thing?  You are not saying that in as many words or.  I saw all your friends from high school and they were all home and they were asking about you.  Yes.  Yes.  Yes.  Or, you know, it's, , you, you know, I, we were, we are getting ready for whatever the ski trip and what you are just reminding them.  I am like, I remember how much you wanted to write.  Like, how's that going?  Like, have you been writing more or whatever you are writing, but you are trying to bring them back to themselves and sometimes.  So we know.  Yes.  You are not even talking about the partner.  You are talking about the, them who is likely getting lost in this relationship.  You might have a better chance of doing what Dr.  Lodish calls breaking the shelf and being, letting them then be able to start to see like, oh, okay.  Something's changing.  It's not always a sure thing, but the, you know, ideally you can then say, you know, especially if you notice, let's say you notice a difficult interaction.  You might, instead of saying that was not okay.  You might want to say, hey, are you okay?  I just saw that.  I just wanted to check in.  I am like, all right, I am going to do it.  I am going to do it.  I am going to do it.  I am going to do it.  I am going to do it.  That's great.  Cause then you get the wheels turning.  Yes.  That's all you want to do is turn the wheels.  Got it.  Okay.  This is a really juicy question.  I love this one.  Okay.  Even though it's really like, not okay.  It's sad.  Yes.  , Dr.  Romany.  My dad is a perverted narcissist.  I do not know what that means, but is a perverted narcissist and has psychopathic traits.  He has met a woman.  He is very interested in this woman is in a higher tax bracket than him and has never married.  And he has her wrapped around his finger.  He's presented a version of himself to her that is not real.  And he's using the same methods he used on my mom.  I feel like I cannot let her get sucked into his lies.

But is it my position to do so?  It irks me so badly to see the mask.  He presents.  And it upsets me that it took her less than a month to fall for his performance.  Did this person called the father of psychopath?  Yes.  Okay.  So let's let's use this question as a jumping off point on the difference between narcissism and psychopathy, right?  Okay.  I do not know if this person's father is psychopathic.  We are just going to go on good faith.  They believe they are.  There's a difference.  Okay.  Even the most malignant narcissist is not going to be psychopathic.  When we jump the rails into psychopathy.  We are talking about someone.  Who based on what she's saying this person saying their dad's doing it may very well be the case.  A psychopathic person is cold callous calculating deceitful lacks.  Any empathy lacks remorse is often superficially charming can be very intelligent has an incredible capacity for running a hustle.  These are these are your grifters.  Okay.  These are people who are able to create very very elaborate.  Lives live double live live parasitic lifestyles go and destroy one person's life move someplace else and leave no sort of no trace of any of that right drawing someone into a new relationship very quickly with that person's falling under their control is very classically something that a psychopath is able to do because psychopathic people lack remorse.  They can do far more harm to another person in addition psychopathic people do not have the insecurity and the anxiety.  We classically see in narcissism narcissism is still a sort of a little bit more of a chaotic interior psychopathic people are just cold and callous.  And so that seems to be what might be the case here.  Now the the way she's describing is that this person was able to trick another person within a month.  That's very classically, you know, either.  Yes, it's more psychopathic than it is malignant narcissistic.  And the question is do you warn and many psychopathic people?  Can be dangerous smell.  So I want to make sure this person is safe.  I mean, listen, I do not know if you have ever remembered the story that really popular podcast from way back of Dirty John, right?  That Dirty John was a guy who the same kind of grift and it culminated quite tragically.  He almost killed the the woman he had, you know, twisted around.  He almost killed her daughter.  Okay, that's why I am saying that these people are dangerous and because if anyone gets in the way of their grift of their hustle.  They will eradicate them.  So assuming this woman is safe.  Okay, so I am just going to okay.  Gigantic caveat.  You are safe.  Okay.  I do not think the new woman is going to believe her a month in is very very fresh.  It is this person is fully indoctrinated being heavily love-bombed right there not going to believe this so they are going to view the daughter and that the psychopath has already gotten to the new partner and told the new partner.  My daughter is jealous.  I think she's kind of weirdly in love with me.  He has crafted a whole story about the daughter that makes the I think this is a woman writing this.  Yes.  Okay, so that makes the daughter look insane.  All right.  So when the daughter goes to new partner and says this the odds are that the psychopathic father has already done his homework.  This is a hard thing though, because if you value the truth and if I take to heart everything that you taught us in the previous two episodes that we have done with you recently.  About the fact that part of the biggest barriers to your own healing from somebody like this is a sense of hope that it's going to change and the feeling of injustice and to me I would really wrestle with the fact that based on my values.  Yes, I would want to be like you getting rid of this motherfucker.  Like he's like he's bad news, but on the other hand how but she can she can go up to her and say I want you to know this.  I do not know what he's told you.  Ideally show up with documentation.  This is who he really is.  This is who he's really about then.  She's done her God's work of the day.  Yes.  And when this new person does not believe it then that's no longer her problem.  Got it.  And as long as you can do that safely safely and that is something that you feel like doing whether it's because you feel the need to get justice served on behalf of you and your mom or not is irrelevant.  You might just honestly want to protect.  The person.  Okay.  Gosh.  Wow.  This is a sad topic.  It's a very sad topic.  How do you keep from getting like beaten down by this?  It's it's I mean, it's a funny question.  I it's not always easy.  Like I do actually get sad quite a bit and I keep to myself and I guess in some ways I live a very simple life and I think there's a reason for that because I think otherwise it's a lot.  I do not trust people as much.  I mean, it's kind of a sad.  It's a sad thing.  That is sad, but I am glad that you are putting it to use.  To help us.  My pleasure.  I find I work is so I have seen people helped and that is really that that really matters.  All right.  I have got rapid-fire questions.  My aging mother is a narcissist and I am the one who has to take care of her.  How can I make this time bearable?  You have to keep orienting it to to who you are many many people will say I cannot believe now that it's all coming to a close and it's falling on my shoulders, but people have to sometimes.  I am to say like, you know, I am a compassionate person.  This is an old person.  I do not know what would happen to them.  Otherwise make really put yourself into that role of I am showing up almost like a nurse of an abusive patient.  They are prepared.  They are going to yell.  They are going to scream do not expect gratitude.  It's going to be a nightmare have therapy have supports make sure you have meaningful pursuits outside of this caregiving, but you almost have to go into an automaton state but also connected to the human.  Being I am is compassionate good and empathic and this is an old person who needs to be cared for I cannot stand her but I will be damned if I let this woman leave me like I am not a compassionate person.  Ooh do it for yourself.  Do it for yourself.  My father is a narcissist have not talked to him in five years.  I would like to reopen the door, but I am terrified.  I am going to get hurt.  How do I protect myself?  Well, he's going to hurt you.  So the question is if you are prepared for so what?  You have to ask yourself.  What's your agenda after five years?  What are you hoping for if you think that in five years because what's happened to this person in five years Mel they have healed being maybe not probably I will tell you.  Here's there's two levels.  There is the the deeper soul healing that may have happened right?

But I want you to think of it as somebody's had a massive surgery that was going to be difficult to heal from and when they are in the midst of the acute acuity of it like I am never going to be able to walk again.  And then five years later.  I am going I am running up the stairs, right?  And so now she's running up the stairs.

But what might still be happening is that internally there's still not when you are running up the stairs again euphoric recall we forget what it's like.  This is why this Ick list becomes a living document that remind everybody of the list.  The Ick list is a list you make of all the terrible things that are being said and done in that relationship everything from ruined my wedding to you know, to lie to me about who my parent was to when I asked for a loan that would have made a difference did not give it to me and I am still paying off the extortionate loan.  I got to insulted my children's weight like write it all cheated on me with my best friend.  Whatever's on your list write it down when you think possibility of changes or you need to look at that and say why would I even interact with this person but in this case after five years some people may say I know that I know this person's limitations, but do you really do you really wreck?  If this person is going to say hurtful things again, so you have to ask yourself if this person comes at me again, will I be able to withstand this or will this take a toll on me?  That's a question only they can answer some work.  I tend to do in therapy with clients is we played out as a role play.  Dr.  Romney compassionate.  I am like do not be a dumb motherfucker.
