If you want to be respected, liked, and taken seriously, your actions matter more than anything.  You see, I have spent years working with the top business owners and starting my own multi-million dollar business.  So I have seen firsthand the differences between the people who get respect versus those who get overlooked.  So these are the five ways to make anyone respect you.  First up is the big question.  Do you want to be respected or do you want to be liked?  I am a natural people pleaser.  And I think this shocks people who meet me today because I do not have traditional people pleasing qualities any longer.  And that's because I have made active choices for the last decade to not choose to be liked more than I want to be respected.  See, when you do not know which one of the two you are going after, you can get confused.  Because when you are meeting people and you want to please people, you can end up pleasing the wrong people.  And I can honestly say that until my early 20s, I was a little bit more of a person who was a little bit more of a person who was a little bit I always prioritized people liking me and what people thought about me more than choosing the right people to respect me.  And what happens when you prioritize people liking you is you compromise.  You spend time around people who do things that you actually disagree with.

But because you want to be liked, not respected, you do not say anything.  You do not change the environment.  Heaven forbid, you do not correct them.  You just keep going on agreeing to things that actually make you feel like you are compromising.  In order to be respected, the first person who has to respect you is you.  So when you think about who you spend your time with today, are you making compromises?  Are you feeling like you have to make people happy or like they have to like you over the things that you know you need to do in order to respect yourself?  When I first went to college, I was not really the partying type.

However, the friends that I was hanging out with did like to party and they like to drink more than I like to drink.

But I did not know how to stop spending time with them.  So I just fell into this role.  Where I would be there, I would always be the sober one, but I was wasting all of my time trying to get them to like me or think that I was cool because I was still in the environment.  It took me longer than it should have to extract myself from that environment.  And not that there's any judgment that I have for people trying to figure their lives out while in college.

But I know that for me, I was making decisions at that time based off of what somebody else thought and what somebody else wanted me to do instead of prioritizing the decisions that I knew would allow me to respect.  Remember, without respect, your voice just gets drowned out and your authority will be entirely ignored.  No matter how friendly or charming you actually are, you have to establish clear boundaries, show competence, communicate with authority to start to earn respect.  Number two is next.  Consistency over long periods of time creates confidence.  It is easy to just go into the gym for a couple of days and you get all excited about it and you buy your cute workout clothes and you are like, I am going to do this.  I am going to do this.  I am going to do this.  I am going to do this.  And you start to think, man, I am going to finally take control of my health and wellness journey.

But if you fast forward two weeks and you are no longer in the gym, your confidence and your ability to stick to your word goes down.  That is the exact same thing that happens with the people in your life when you tell them that you are going to show up for them and you are going to make it to dinner and you back out last minute because you do not feel like it.  You do not want to.  You do not feel good.  You are not going to build confidence that you are the type of person that does what they say that they are going to do.  So every decision that you make, whether it's consistent or inconsistent is giving somebody an understanding of how much confidence they can have in you.  Now extrapolate this to the work that you do, whether you are a team member, you own a business.  When you say that you are going to get something done, do you do it by that time?  When you say that you are going to follow up, do you actually follow up?  You see people learn by how you follow up, by how you show up over long periods of time.  If they can or cannot count on you.  I know instantly who I can and cannot count on.  And the people who I count on are the people who always follow up with me.  And if they follow up with me consistently, for six months, if they happen to miss something, I am not that worried about it because I know by their actions that they are a consistent person.

But if they sometimes follow up, sometimes do not follow up, sometimes do what they say they are going to do.  Sometimes they do not say what they are going to do.  I am just going to bypass them.  And when you bypass somebody in an organization, all of a sudden you start to ask yourself, well, why do I need this person?  If I am going to end up having to do their job because they are not consistent.  And yet when you talk to the person, all they want is more opportunity.  They want to be trusted with more.  They want to handle more.  They want to make more money.  They want to do big things, but they cannot even handle what's in front of them.  This is actually why respect does not just happen overnight.  What is so cool about being consistent.  It is in your control.  If you say that you are going to do something.  And what's also cool is you do not have to commit to something.  If you have no intention to do it, that's fine too.  Next is number three.  You have to set clear boundaries.  One of the hardest lessons I have had to learn is not just setting boundaries, but it's actually getting other people to respect those boundaries.  There's two steps to boundaries.  The first is creating them.  The second is enforcing them.  When it comes to setting boundaries.  The first thing that you have to ask yourself is what are you not willing to tolerate in your environment?  Pull out a piece of paper, maybe the notes app on your phone and list the types of behaviors that you will not tolerate from people who work with you, who spend time with you, who are friends with you.  What are the things that are absolute nose for you from that list?  You can then start to create the list of characteristics that you would expect of the greatest people who would come into your life.  So you have a list of hard nose, but then you also have a list of this is what I would expect of the best people, people that might not even know who I am to represent and bring into my life.  Once you have that list, you then have to look at how do I spend my time?  And do I spend my time that's in alignment with this list?  Because if you do not have great people in your life, it might be because you are not living in the same value set as the people that you want to bring in your life.  So of course, you are never going to want to spend time with you.  When I first started wanting to spend time with Elena Cardone, I realized that if she hung out with me for a day, I would have to tell her and talk to her about things that I was interested in and things that I was doing at the time.  I was not working out consistently.  I did not hold myself accountable to goals that I was setting.  I was wishy-washy about what I did or did not want for my future.  I was not able to clearly communicate the personal goals that I had for myself.  And so I spent six months becoming the type of person that Elena would want to be friends with.  So that when I did have the opportunity to meet her, to spend time around her, we had similar shared interests.  When she wanted to go to the gym on the very first trip that we took together, I was not embarrassed by how out of shape I was because I had already started to go to the gym.  So you have your list of the things that you want.  And when it comes to the list of things that you do not want, here's the challenge.  When it comes to the things that you do not want and the boundaries that you were setting, where you would kick somebody out of your life for violating those boundaries, it can be incredibly difficult to draw a hard line.  I cannot tell you how many people have to my face made disrespectful comments, have laughed at me, have lessened my role, have not taken me seriously.  And in those moments, it's challenging to actually say, you no longer get a spot here because they are already there for a reason.  They are there because they are family.  They are there because you have known them for a while, because you hired them.  You thought that they were going to help you when they were responsible for something.  And I have always found that if somebody is violating a boundary that I have and I get rid of them, I am going to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to be the one that's going to have to get that extra stuff done to me.

But if you think that that's going to be the one that's going to get the most out of you, I am not going to trust you to take over the place.  Because that's what I am going to be doing to the people that I am going to be supporting.

But if you think that things are going to get worse, be challenging, everything's just going to melt down.  When you get rid of people that are not respecting you, then you are not going to get rid of them.

But I can promise you, just trust me on this.  Get rid of them and see what happens.  You are going to be amazed because you will not go backwards.  You will actually springboard forward because you do not have somebody constantly invalidating you.  Now we are on to number four, one of my favorites.  Master your craft.  The easiest way to get respect is to be great at something.  If you are not great at anything, it's hard to think about, but why should somebody respect you?  You want respect?  Well, what have you done that would make somebody respect you?  Is it the great person that you are?  Is it that you are nice to everyone, friendly to people, you are a good person?  Well, what does that actually mean?  If you are a mom and you want to be respected, the way that you get respect is by saying, hey, these are my kids and this is everything that I do in order to make sure that I am setting them up for success, that I am being a good example to them, and that I am able to help them contribute positively to society.  If you want to be a great team member, you would be showing the fact that your team has improved because you are there.  The results show if you are somebody who actually deserves respect, the environment around you should improve because you are there.  So when you look at your environment, you should ask yourself this question.  Is my environment better because I am there?  If it's not better, if it stays the same, if it's worse because you get on the scene, then what's the point?  Nobody should respect you because you do not do anything to make things better.  On the contrary to that, if you do show up to an environment and you choose to make it better, you can then point to, hey, all of these things that are positive happened because I was there.  And that is why people respect you.

Now, I work with team members and business owners each and every day.  And the fastest thing that I drive them to is a specific stat.  What is the thing that we can measure that you did that you are great at?  I think about the social media team.  That I work with.  They have ridiculous stats now.  Why do they have stats?  Because they have gotten good at one thing.  How do we take video and create compelling messages for people to understand who we are, what we do, and what we are all about?  See, those stats that they now have are actually in the physical universe.  It's not just that they happen to be good at social media.  There are social media managers who cannot produce a single great piece of content that people actually want to watch.  The difference between somebody who's average and somebody who's great is the stats.

But.  The fastest way to get confused is to think that you have to be good at social media at the exact same time that you have to be good at PR.  At the exact same time that you have to be good at some other form of marketing.  Get stats in one area.  People will then respect you for those stats that you have because you can say, hey, I did this.  I did this.  I did this.  I did this in order to make this happen.  That creates confidence, which ultimately leads people to respect you.  To contrast my current social team compared to previous team members that I have worked with.  I will never forget.  When one of my team members came in my office and she said, the two of us are so overwhelmed.  We are so overworked.  There's no way that we can create more content.  It's performing as best as it can.  And it's just going to take time for it to perform.  Well, fast forward.  It was just her that was not performing because she did not actually study the craft.  She never decided that I am going to be great to fully understand what is working on social right now.  Not what's working five years ago.  Not what worked two years ago.

But what is actually working right now to drive engagement, to create spectacular content.  And so we have changed up our team.  And it's fascinating that all of a sudden this growth has happened.  All because our team is dedicated to picking one thing that they are great at.  So how does this apply to you?  You pick one thing that you want to master and you go after that thing for the next 18 months or until you get undeniable results in that area.  After that, you move on to the next thing that you want to be great at.  And when you can show that you can deliver results over and over again.  By understanding the areas of your team.  And understanding the areas of your interests deeply.  Respect becomes automatic.  Lastly, number five.  Your actions will always speak the loudest.  I still do not get the level of respect from people that I would like.  The trick is to not use someone's lack of respect as a reason for why you should stop trying.  When I decided to marry my husband, I was petrified that for the rest of my life, people were just going to look at me as my husband's wife.  Where I would be in his shadows.  Because he is unbelievably smart.  Successful.  And truly a business savant.  And I thought, oh, for the rest of my life, people would just tell me, oh, you got lucky.  Or you must not work very hard.  Or what's it like to work in your husband's business.  Even if I am working in the business 18 hours a day and driving consistent value.

But finally, I realized that people's lack of respect for me has nothing to do with the respect that I need to create for myself.  I am the only one who gets to see how I do or do not show up.  You are the only one who gets to see how you do or do not show up.  So do you respect the way that you show up?  It does not matter that the world is going to judge you or say negative things or be critical.  Because that's on them.

But if you do what you know you are capable of, you go after your goals, it might actually be that you go through all of your life and never get the respect from others that you deserve.  And that is completely okay.  Respect is ultimately about your actions and your results.  So just put in the work.  Do not talk about it.  Do not complain about people not respecting you.  Nobody cares.  Okay.  So put your head down.  Prove to people over a long period of time that they should respect you because of the results that you are able to drive.  If you do these things in just a short period of time, you could have all the respect that you want.
