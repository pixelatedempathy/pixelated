And so research began and two years ago AFM published that all the research was in and that 97% of addicts have this thing called complex trauma.  I do not like the term because it does not explain itself very well.  What it means is a child grows up or is in environment where they do not feel safe and as a result of not feeling safe they are always on guard, always in survival mode which means they are ready for fight or flight and if they are too little to fight back and they are too little to flee they freeze.  So the three F's and so that is how they learn to cope that is how they learn to survive and once they found drugs and alcohol they have found the perfect way for fight flight or freeze.  They can numb everything, avoid everything, it becomes the perfect survival coping skill until addiction sets in and what was once their best friend becomes their enemy.  So what I said last week is if you take those fight flight freeze characteristics and begin to break them down you end up with 50 different characteristics that people from complex trauma use to survive but once they become an adult those things that help them survive and stay safe now make their life unmanageable, now make their relationships fall apart so that they are not able to experience healthy relationships or healthy living.  And so what I have been working on over the last ten years in my own teaching and in treatment programs is to develop and help people understand that when you deal with addiction you are dealing with the symptom of deeper stuff which is the complex trauma unless you can take those 50 characteristics and begin to learn what healthy looks like you will never stay clean and sober and so recovery is not just stop using or drinking recovery to be effective has to be learning how to be healthy and that means identifying the unhealthy coping things replacing them with healthy and so that's what we are doing so this is designed to give you a self-awareness of how complex trauma affected you, shaped you, created in you, who you are, how you cope, how you relate and then what you need to do to begin to change that.  So last week we talked about the first one and that was the most subtle deep core thing that when you are in survival mode your priorities change and instead of being all about loving people you are all about protecting yourself.  So safety becomes priority number one but that means that you have to become more important than everybody else which means that you become a narcissist it's all about me and addiction fits that world very well.  Tonight I want to give you six more so I am going to go a bit faster but I want you to understand them and if they apply to you you can put a big check mark beside it or you can nudge your partner if it applies to them or if it's a main problem in your life you can be put a great big star beside it and go home feeling all depressed that you are so screwed up.  So the second characteristic of complex trauma is they have an instant gratification focus.  That is very important for two reasons where it comes from as this.  I often asked addicts in treatment if you had an alcoholic father and he one day at lunch time you know what I am feeling really good today I like to take everybody out for a nice cream cone so we could go right now or we could wait till after supper tonight and go out this evening.  What would you pick right now?  Why?  Because he might be drunk after supper.  So what you learn in complex trauma or danger is if you get a chance for pleasure grab it because it might not be there 10 minutes from now and so you become very focused on instant gratification but there's a second reason and it's a brain thing and so the beauty of what I do is that all the brain research coming out is helping us understand complex trauma and how it affects the brain and I find this one very fascinating.  So we are going to look at a brain picture here so that little carrot that goes down that's kind of red orange that's your brain stem.  That's the first part of the brain that is formed in the in the womb and that's the part that controls your organs your breathing your heart rate your blood pressure all the things that you do without even thinking about it all the things that you need to do in order to survive that's your brain stem then on the top of that in the center your brain you will see limbic system that's the second part of your brain to develop and it develops in the womb and as a child and that's your child brain and that's your emotion center and then around that on the outside is a cerebral cortex which does not finish developing till you are in your 30s and that's your thinking brain and that evaluates life that evaluates your emotions that makes decisions that ways out pros and cons that's supposed to be the management in the company okay now here what happens in a child brain the limbic brain how does a child make decisions the child makes decisions that go like this will it make me feel good right now so the wisdom of a decision in the mind of a child is will it give me instant pleasure or instant safety but it's got to be instant they do not think long-term they think now so if you were to say to your child you know we got two choices for supper tonight chocolate bars and broccoli they would say chocolate bars why instant pleasure broccoli instant disgust now a parent is supposed to have a good cerebral cortex and the cerebral cortex thinks and makes decisions based on long-term consequences they see the big picture that's your cerebral cortex and so it says if I have chocolate bars now it will give me instant pleasure but I could be a diabetic in 20 years long-term consequences so chocolate bars is not a wise decision a wise decision is broccoli so guess what the family is supposed to be a limbic brain child saying I want a chocolate a parent saying no in 20 years you will thank me that I made you eat broccoli and you are mad at your parents and I am never going to thank you and you are so mean blah blah blah but they went out and then 20 years later you thank them and you will wow were you ever smart back then because they use the cerebral cortex okay now what part of the brain does complex trauma stimulate fear fear is the limbic part of the brain and so what is the priority in the limbic part of the brain instant instant safety and so what happens in complex trauma is you are living in danger all the time so your limbic is being stimulated all the time and you are living out of a child brain that is determined or makes decisions based on instant pleasure or instant safety that's how you evaluate life your body is getting older your brain is staying in the child part and your cerebral cortex your thinking brain is not developing guess what is one of the hardest parts of recovery is beginning to work out of your cerebral cortex beginning to develop your cerebral cortex beginning to have your cerebral cortex respond to your limbic brain when it gets fired up and it says I want this now and so you are all stressed out and your brain is in fear mode because you are going this is too much for me and your limbic brain says I need to use to take a break from my stress what's the limbic brain thinking about short term instant gratification instant relief what's supposed to happen at that point in time is your cerebral cortex is supposed to come online and say listen limbic brain let's play that tape out to the end your idea might give you instant pleasure but it's got long term painful consequences and so if you are an addict in recovery what you realize is a lot of recovery is your limbic brain having a fight with your cerebral cortex sadly for many people the limbic brain trumps the cerebral cortex it is so powerful now there's one other piece here when fear gets triggered and we are going to talk about this more next week the brain secretes a chemical in the brain called cortisol and cortisol gives you the energy for fight or flight it stimulates your adrenal gland and now you got adrenaline pumping but when cortisol is released in the brain it does something very important for survival it is saying we are in danger here we have to go into fight flight mode we do not have time to think so cortisol shuts down your cerebral cortex and says do not think too long about this get out of here complex trauma messes that all up because now it wants to go into fight flight and not think and so recovery is this when your brain is stimulated the limbic brain cortisol is shutting down your thinking brain your emotions are escalated what you have to do is say I got to de-escalate my emotions and get my thinking brain back online that is one of the hardest things to do because that limbic brain is so powerful cortisol gives such intensity to that emotion that is almost feels impossible to stop it but that is what recovery at times boils down to okay next characteristic flows out of the first one people from complex trauma are impulsive that means they act before they think so you get an impulse and you say let's just do it do not think about it let's operate without thinking so that ties in with the previous one fourth one emotional stuffers let me explain how this develops what we do the consequences of it and it goes like this if you grew up in complex trauma you experienced a lot of pain and a lot of scary stuff fear and so you would cry you would show fear you would show anxiety and usually what would happen is you get punished for that or you get made fun of laugh that told you were a suck a weakling and so what you realize is there certain emotions that you now consider weak emotions because they make you vulnerable to being punished ashamed made fun of all of that so what happens in you is you say this to yourself showing those emotions never leads to anything good it only leads to pain only leads to bad therefore I can never show those weak emotions so you stuff them down you try to freeze them out and then to help you do that in part of you goes who needs emotions anyways they are a dumb invention they are unnecessary I am going to be a cerebral intellect and I am just going to operate out of my brain and I I could cut off my body from here down one matter to me except for sex all I need is that brain and that's the important part emotions are dumb stupid okay many of you have gone there then another thing that children do is this the more I care about something the more it hurts when I lose it or when it's endangered and that's when I cry that's when I get afraid so the way to not experience those weak emotions is do not care about anything just develop an attitude of indifference to everything where you walk around going whatever nothing bothers me and you try to shut down any type of feeling at all when you find drugs you go I just found the perfect way to numb freeze not feel alcohol all of that that does all of this perfectly for me so what I ask clients all the time is this you are making this sound like a really good system that you have developed are you sure it's as good as you think it is so let me use some of the problems that most people begin to experience from shutting down all those weak emotions number one what you are doing is not just shutting down emotions what you are doing internally is you are saying there's parts of me that I hate I hate I am so sensitive I hate that I get angry so quickly I hate that I cry so easily or I get sad so much I am embarrassed by parts of me and what is going on in your brain is you are saying I wish I could just cut out those parts of me and throw them away and so now what you have done is tried to cut yourself in half the part of you you like the part of you you do not like and the part of you you do not like you just try to shove away lock up throw away the key try not to even admit that it's there in your life so now you are less than a total person you are not a complete person and you hate a part of yourself second thing that happens you try to convince yourself that emotions do not affect you that they do not influence your decisions but what you begin to realize is that emotions are running your life mainly fear and anger and they just keep messing stuff up they mess up relationships they mess up jobs they keep you awake at night they keep you full of guilt and so emotions as much as you try to stuff them down continue to run the show and then the next thing you begin to realize if you are an addict is that emotions lead to relapse now one of the things we deal with with clients all the time is what are your emotional or what are your relapse triggers and what I say to clients is this think of it this way the beginning of a relapse usually starts with an emotion it usually starts with a painful and intense negative emotion that emotion starts off a series of dominoes falling that end with a relapse and so emotions if you do not learn how to deal with them and manage them they will lead to relapse after relapse after relapse next thing what many people find is that they try to stuff down all the negative emotions the painful ones but they find out that emotions are part of a package so all of your emotions the happiness the pleasure all of those ones they are part of the painful emotions and so when you stuff one down you stuff everything down and as you stuff down the negative emotions you begin to feel dead inside you begin to feel an emptiness a boredom you are just not very alive and that is important to be honest about and then one other thing that people realize that the shutdown emotions is they have to shut down their conscience because if they allow themselves to have a conscience they feel guilt and then guilt leads to all kinds of other emotions and so now they are not just shutting down emotions they are shutting down their conscience they are hardening they are hard they are hardening themselves you all know you have ended up with a robot not a human being but a robot that is not a good way to live do you realize that emotions once you get and work through your painful emotions and you begin to experience positive emotions they add such beauty to life they make life something that most of you have never experienced a pleasure a contentment a joy that you will never have as long as you try to disregard your emotions next one that comes out of all of this emotions you need distractions I say to clients all the time the worst punishment you can give a person with complex trauma is to stick them in a room all by themselves with nothing to do can you imagine that your legs would be jiggling you would be pacing you would be a basket case why is that two main reasons complex trauma you are always on guard because you are always in danger which meant you could never relax you always had to be alert you always had to be on your game and so you could never just take a day off you were just bouncing all the time but then beyond that you just do not like yourself so if you are in a room all by yourself with nothing to do that means you got to live in your own skin that means you got to feel your emotions you got to feel and think your thoughts and you do not like that and so people from complex trauma because they do not like themselves they do not like living in their own skin always need a distraction and that can be video games that can be activity after activity workaholism shopping drama whatever as long as you do not have to live in your own skin so here's what you want to understand moving forward what is recovery big picture it's learning to like living in your own skin and that is a journey it does not happen overnight with that is what we are working towards and we will get more about that in the weeks ahead the next thing addicted to chaos and drama this is always a very interesting thing what happens in complex trauma is you live and grow up in drama and chaos you do not know what to expect from one day to a next you do not know what kind of mood that will be in when he gets home from work you do not know what kind of mood mumble being you do not know if it will hit the fan or what there's just drama part of you hates drama but part of you needs drama to feel normal and that's the challenge in recovery but let me develop that a little bit further I ask people all the time what is one what are your greatest relapse triggers always in the top three I am bored what happens when I am bored I create chaos and what's part of creating chaos relapse but why do we feel bored let me give you two things things that people would classify as being bored are these number one if you have spent your life stuffing your emotions you just do not feel and when you do not feel that feels boring that feels empty and so instead of saying I bored because I have stuffed my emotions all my life you say I am bored because I do not have enough drama which is a lie but that's how your brain has been working secondly what happens when you get in recovery and you get your job back you get your kids back you hit money back and your relationships are going smoothly you go I am bored it's going too smoothly it feels boring and your brain and this happens at a subconscious level your brain goes I need some drama to spice things up around here so let's have a fight let's sabotage our recovery let's go and do risky behavior let's relapse but I cannot stand healthy because it's boring and that is a danger that everybody in recovery will face at some time where they think a good normal healthy life is boring because it's not the normal they grew up with and so you have to retrain your brain to understand what normal is and that the good stuff comes as you stick at it now here's a little graph I put together so I want you to think of it in terms of being in a relationship you could think of it in terms of recovery as well but at the very left you are in a relationship things are going smoothly but you feel bored okay now in your brain what has made you feel in love for most people from complex trauma they feel in love when they have intense feelings and they got to be really intense so what the brain says when the relationship's going well is something's wrong in this relationship I do not feel in love right now I need to get some intense feelings back but how does the brain figure out how to get those intense feelings back first it's got to go down to chaos let's create a crisis let's create everything's falling apart let's have a big fight and then we will make up and then we will go to intense feelings whoo that's what I was aiming at I just had to go through chaos and crisis to get to the intense feelings of love again but then you go on and then you get bored again now here's where it starts to change the next time to get to the intense feelings it's got to get a little deeper dark it's got to get a little deeper crisis and then you go back up and then it starts to feel boring and now you got to go to an even deeper crisis so what you see is your relationship is starting to go from one extreme to the other and the extremes are getting worse and worse that's complex trauma chasing feeling intense feelings and not feeling bored problem is over time you begin to spend more time in crisis because it's all breaking down it's all falling apart and your attempts at creating crisis to get to a high just stop working so what you have to figure out and recover it is what does healthy love look like healthy love is not creating a crisis so I get intense it is gradually building trust safety intimacy respect sharing openness and as you share that you do not have that intense stuff necessarily but a deep joy settles in a deep connection settles in and you begin to understand gradually that is much more satisfying than the old graph of crisis intense crisis intense final one escape through fantasy so what can happen if you have mainly negative emotions and painful emotions your brain says I do not want to live here this is too difficult oh sorry I am losing my mate this is too difficult to live in and so what the brain can do is say we got to check out whenever the pain gets too bad we are going to check out into a fantasy world and so what can happen is all kinds of different things some kids in extreme pain they can check out of their own body and they can if they are being sexually abused they can be like they are on the ceiling looking down on somebody else being sexually abused or they can check out to a beach in Bahamas and just have a sunny day on the beach and be totally oblivious to what is happening to their body others it might not be a severe so they will have pain but they cannot wait to get to their bedroom and they are going to create their own little fantasy world where everybody loves everybody and they play dolls they do all those things to create a safe loving world it's not real but it's an escape it takes them out of the pain and then others as they get older they escape into watching wow when I was little you watch the leave it to beaver then it was the Cosby's the Huckstables and all of those things I do not know what they watch now but it was the perfect little family and you watch that and you said oh I wish my family could be like that and you escaped into that and then you found novels and you escaped into that and you can be walking down the street and you can be off in a fantasy world out of touch with the reality so complex trauma what I hope you are seeing is the brain is saying let's stop living in the present it's too painful let's live in the future in fantasy or in the past but not in the present so recovery is figuring out how to come out of my fantasy live in the present and deal with it and that is a journey too so I have covered six things tonight I hope you see that every one of them is a journey now let me end with this illustration somebody shared this research with me last week and I thought it was very excellent it proves very well what I am saying and it shows what is needed in treating complex trauma so the research if you have not been familiar with it if you look at addiction treatment programs in Winnipeg they are either 28 days or two months they begin to ask how long does it take a person with complex trauma to totally relearn all these new ways of coping six months to 10 years is what they found out here's the research you have to imagine yourself driving a car so if you want to turn left your hands at the top of the steering wheel you pull your hand towards the left right if you want to turn right you pull your hand toward the right okay you understand that you have practiced that since you were 15 years old let's say I come to you and I say okay now when you are driving if you want to turn right you got to pull the steering wheel left and if you want to turn left you got to pull the steering wheel right now you can understand that immediately in your brain and you can say got it make sense how what would you do in actually doing that you know how long they found it took before a person mastered that skill eight months eight months of accidents before you got that skill down pot why is it because the person's stupid no they immediately understood what they had to do what they realized is they had reinforced a brain circuit for years that said turn right move steering wheel right and that had been reinforced thousands and thousands of times what you are trying to do now is build a new brain circuit that said turn right by turning left that you have to practice and practice and practice and it is hard to replace a well entrenched brain circuit with a new one eight months guess what you got to do with complex trauma you do not just have to relearn how to steer a car you got to relearn about wise decisions are long term thinking not instant gratification emotions have to be felt with felt and learned to be managed then I cannot create chaos because I feel bored I got to learn to live healthy I got to learn to cope in all of these different areas I got to learn to deal with all these brain circuits that have been triggered by painful emotions and build a new brain circuit on top that takes work so every attic once a shortcut every attic once a magic pill I hate to break it to you recovery from complex trauma is hard work and it takes time and it takes tons of practice and I hope you are up for the journey let's pray.
