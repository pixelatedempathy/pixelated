Hello everyone. I am very happy to be here today to conduct this inspection with you. If you are ready, we can start. Our army is ready to defend us. Since the war in Ukraine, the question has been on everyone's lips, in Switzerland and in Europe. And the answer is not necessarily the one we are waiting for. If we talk about the chance we give to the militiamen to survive in a modern combat, we are not ready. We have to give them material, which is modern material, which can protect them and give them a chance to be at the same level as a potential enemy. Today, this is not the case. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. We no longer have the capacity to assume. In Europe, no country today has the defense capacity to face the new risks and threats that come with the Russian aggression and its stance on the European continent. Peace cannot be guaranteed on our continent itself. Beyond Ukraine. The Russian threat is there and it's hitting European countries. It's hitting us. The time of comfort has changed. We all know that. If Europe wants to survive, it must be armed. In Switzerland, our army lacks modern equipment, weapons, ammunition, and equipment to accomplish its defence mission on complex battlefields. Worse, at the beginning of the year, our defence ministry has just gone through one of the most serious crises in its history, with resignations and scandals to the scent of fraud and corruption. The Swiss are watching over a sector of the national exhibition whose materials symbolize our defence. It was a time when the Swiss army was at its peak. We are in Lausanne at the national exhibition of 1960. In the middle of a cold war, the government gives priority to defence and the army supports the Swiss who are pressing into its pavilion. Inside, a quasi-Hollywood film celebrates our armed forces. Our country has more than 600,000 active soldiers, 300 fighter planes, and 800 combat tanks. The bridge is ready. The tank regiment 2 is starting to cross. What are some simple things to add? We have more than 600,000 artillery systems. We show the public the training for urban combat with flamethrowers. And we do not hesitate, always for training, to bombard our napa paddocks. Today, the reality of our army is far from being as spectacular. Our armed forces have a maximum of 140,000 men, four times less. We are in the Col des Moches, where we meet the division commander Reynaldro, a career soldier and one of the highest-ranking officers in the army, during his inspection of two recruitment schools. You put on your helmets! A section is training for mortar fire. Well, we're good. Oh, it's not like a sick man. No, I'm not sick. Is there a problem today with the shortage of soldiers in the Swiss army? Yes, we do have a shortage. If you want, the image we could take is that we are preparing a mass of soldiers, so we are preparing a match where we should have 45 players, and we actually have an effective of 27. That is to say that we can train, we can do recruitment schools. The recruitment schools are well-filled, in the first term, with about 20,000 per year. But the overall mass of the army, if we had to mobilize it, is too small for the challenges we should face in the defence. It's 120,000 compared to the capacities we would really need. It's not enough. And that's the imbalance we have today. Two, three, fire! Another problem, the equipment and the equipment, often worn out and insufficient. Wait, wait, wait! But the main gap we have is in the tanks, it's in the heavy training, in the artillery, the armored tanks, the Leopard. And that's where this gap must be now, today, compensated, in order to give ourselves the chance, with the heavy elements, to have this first force in combat, this defense force. The heavy training is now in the air. The heavy training is now in the air. The heavy training is now in the air. Here are these heavy training units, in exercise on the Col du Saint-Plon this winter. This mountain artillery company uses armored and armored M109s, which have more than 50 years of service. During the day's exercise, only half of these tanks can shoot. The others are in trouble. It's not great. We should have adapted equipment. And that's why we need to modernize. And there is work to be done. We are in one of the repair workshops of the army. This mechanic is in charge of another type of armor, the M113, on the plows, although it has recently been revised. Rolf Siegenthaler is the division commander in charge of the logistics base of the army. This is a real old tank. With this kind of old equipment, there is always something that will break, here or there. We can't predict in advance what will break. We are always surprised. We are always surprised. We are always surprised. Other archivist vehicles are on the list of injured. Other archivist vehicles are on the list of injured. What does this Dura truck have? Is it its transmission belt or its battery? Is it its transmission belt or its battery? Battery, ok. The battery, ok. And the MBK 300, is there a problem with the gearbox? What have we done for this one? We are trying to change the parts. When these old tanks work, it's good, but they can turn into a deadly trap. If a lost bullet hits the tank in a straight line, it can pierce it. This means that the protection of the crew is not guaranteed. And this tank does not protect against mines either. The division leader estimates that only 3 out of 10 battalions, whether heavy or infantry, are equipped with the necessary equipment to fulfill their territorial defence mission. Whose fault is it? The political will is to do something big. It's simple. There was no political will to rearm us in a consistent way. Over the last 30 years, there has been no significant purchase of weapons. We have just filled in small gaps. In fact, all the available money has been invested in the maintenance of the existing equipment. The time when our troops proudly marched in our cities is far away, under the applause of the crowd, as here in Lausanne in 1987. After the end of the Cold War, successive economic programs were cut into the fat and muscle of the military. In 1989, the Swiss people also took part in the war. They voted on an initiative that demanded the suppression of the army. Liberate the French! It was rejected by 65%, but a good third of the Swiss still voted for this abolition. Our military forces are like this weakened army, deserted or transformed into a museum, as here in Chillon. We meet the Brigadier Denis Froidevaux, former member of the Major General of the Earth Forces, former president of the Swiss Society of Officers. He was the head of the Civil and Military Security Service of the Vaud County for 20 years, before retiring a few months ago. We started from the principle that this era of Cold War, of bipolar world, of peace through nuclear dissuasion, would produce dividends of peace for eternity. And we have not ceased to reduce, to weaken, the capacity of defense of Switzerland. I want to prove that we made a first reform project called Army 95. Imagine that at that time, the geniuses of Bern had invented the fact that we could do a rehearsal every two years. It was largely enough to keep the know-how. Then we reduced the means of Army 21. And then the Parliament did not give the credits necessary to carry out Army 21. We had to do a sub-project called DEVA. And that's where we are today. So we went from an army of 650,000 men to an army of a few hundred thousand men. It means everything. During these years of peace, the army's first mission was to help in the event of a catastrophe and promote peace. The reduction of military expenses also made profit for civil society, for example by investing public money in education or research. This is what we call the dividends of peace. Georg Gassler, himself a artillery colonel, is a renowned military expert who works for the influential German daily newspaper NZZ. The army was redirected towards supporting civil authorities. And we reduced the proper defense capacities. In terms of dividends of peace, it is estimated that Switzerland could benefit from 140 billion francs for other expenses. It is very clear that a bourgeois parliament, a federal bourgeois council, treated the army as a negligible quantity. During all the reforms, we were always promised that we could re-muscle the army in ten years, that it could be re-equipped and therefore ready. That was not the case. It is not so much a matter of anticipation. We turned our gaze away. We did not want to return to the time when war was a means of leading a policy. Martin Pfister. But in Bern, in politics, things are changing. Last March, the parliament elected a new federal councilor at the head of the Department of Defense, Martin Pfister. A Zougoua centrist who also has the rank of colonel. He gave us a great interview only a few weeks after entering office. I swear it. The army does a lot of things very well. The army does a lot of things very well. The instructions are good, the conduct is well done. We are fulfilling the missions that are entrusted to us, for example in the field of disasters. But it is undeniable that we have great gaps in terms of equipment, ammunition, and we also lack certain capacities to respond to new forms of conflict. Today, conflicts are not just classic military conflicts. The current threat in terms of security goes far beyond. There are forms of hybrid warfare. For example, disinformation campaigns, espionage, attacks, attacks against our important institutions. It is therefore very important that we focus again on the capacity of defense of the army and on all other areas of security. It is obviously the war in Ukraine that has awakened the political Bern. At the end of 2024, the parliament gave a new government. The majority of the right voted for the increase in the budget allocated to the Department of Defense. In 2024, it was 5.7 billion francs. By 2028, the department will be able to spend 4 billion more. The goal is for military spending to reach 1% of GDP by 2032. Member of the Security Policy Commission, the Vaudois centrist Isabelle Chapuis, is one of the elected members who want to re-muscle the army so that it is ready to engage in much more complex battle fields than ever before. The military is ready to engage in much more complex battle fields than ever before. It is true that the stock exchanges have been opened, and the parliament has shown very clearly that security has become a priority. It is also true that what is going to be essential is the way in which it is going to be spent. It is also true that what is going to be essential is the way in which it is going to be spent. We will also have to put correct priorities. A credible army is an army that is also equipped, that has sufficient material in quantity and sufficient quality. Obviously, this is not the case today. And then it is true that we must also strengthen all our capabilities that come first, namely the intelligence. There is a big lack in the field of intelligence. We must also strengthen ourselves in the field of cyber. We must also strengthen ourselves in the field of cyber. And then, as we know, we are also under a lot of attack on information or on our perception of information. This is what we call the cognitive war. And there too, we must prepare. All this, we must do it right away because it has already happened now. So in fact, what is terrible is that we must, we cannot neglect one field to favour another. The left and the PS in the lead are opposed to the increase in the number of people in the military budget because they risk being made dependent on other areas, such as international cooperation. But there is also a divergence on what threatens Switzerland, as explained by the socialist from the Jurassic, Pierre-Alain Fridé, member of the Security Policy Commission. The war is in Europe, but in fact it is not in Europe, it is at the border of Europe. And in fact, from my point of view, the security of the country, it is not questioned by the government. It is questioned by this war. On the other hand, there are threats, it is clear. Terrorism, cyber attack problems, misinformation, great crime, all that is obvious. Distance attacks by missiles, that is always a possibility because now it can go very far. And in the face of the real threat that concerns the country, there are indeed flaws. We are missing a lot of police officers. We are missing a high-level intelligence service. And then we have no air defense system that would allow us to fight with missiles. So we hear noises, rearmament, which go in all directions. But it is mainly faced with hypothetical risks that do not concern us. The invasion of the country. So we want to repair leopard tanks, we want to buy artillery, things like that. And there, it's investment in the void. On the army side, we defend ourselves from all war frenzy. In his morgue headquarters, where he leads the 1st territorial division, which includes the six Roman cantons and Bern, we find the division leader Dros. When I hear the army wants to buy toys, etc. The army wants nothing at all. It has a mission in the constitution, it is defense. The army has a responsibility. We, the military, explain for these responsibilities, in relation to the threat, what are the needs we have. In terms of equipment, in terms of personnel. Then the decision makers decide. And if they decide that we must not defend ourselves, that we must do something else, we will do what we are told. So that's also something quite easy in the system. It is that a soldier is relatively easy to lead because we obey orders. There was a awakening. The politicians, we became aware of it. There is an increase that is assured. There is money that will come. And now we have to, the army, show that we are able to do it. We have to keep this country as being protected. The problem is that this influx of public money intervenes when the vital prognosis of the Department of Defense is engaged, almost. For years, it has been shaken by major crises. We explain to you. The Department of Defense, the Defense of the Protection of the Population and Sports, the DDPS of its little name, is this masterful. With the data available online, we tried to make it the difficult organigram. With 12,279 employees, it is by far the most supplied department of the Confederation. It supervises the army, but also the quantity of other offices, such as the armament, Swiss weapons, or the intelligence service. At the beginning of this year, the DDPS is completely decapitated. On January 15, the federal advisor Viola Amert announced her resignation six years after taking the direction of the DDPS. On February 21, it is Peter Mertz, the head of the air force, who leaves. On February 25, the press reports a double resignation. It is the head of the army, Thomas Sussly, who leaves, as well as the head of the intelligence service, Christian Ducey. And then the next day, it is a gigantic case of presumed fraud and corruption that breaks through RUAG, the armament company in the hands of the Confederation. There, we hit the bottom. In a way, the DDPS has imploded at that moment. I wrote it in a comment. The situation is explosive. RUAG's reputation is ruined. And above the market, the top officials resign. In our opinion, this is a very important moment. In any other country, this would have caused a crisis of security. This storm in the opaque world of defense erupts after years of controversy over projects with a surplus of several million and ended with years of delay. There is, for example, the phenomenal cost of modernizing the Durault military trucks at 250,000 francs, when they had been bought at 140,000 francs. Where the famous drones, the Israeli surveillance system, six devices for a total of 300 million francs, chosen in 2015. It is now a question of abandoning them, because they still do not fly. They have neither a decryption system nor a system for detecting other aircraft. Problem also on the side of the SRC, the Confederation's intelligence service. Leak of sensitive data to Russia, accusations of poor management, the establishment of ineffective work processes, the SRC is at risk. Here, there is a real problem through our ability to anticipate. And our ability to anticipate is our intelligence service. It is our first line of defense in the strategic depth. And this intelligence service, it is absolutely necessary to provide it with the necessary means. Do you realize that the Confederation's intelligence service has an effective lower than that of the police ministry? It is not only the police, but also the intelligence service itself. It is the intelligence service of the Lausanne municipal police. But it is unimaginable. We are going up a notch on the scale of scandals, with the controversial purchase in 2021 of 36 American F-35s for 6 billion francs. The production of F-35s is so problematic that it makes it the most expensive fighter plane in the world. In August, the Federal Council confirms that the bill will inflate, probably more than a billion francs. This is on demand from the Americans. Here are the statements of the Minister of Defense of the time and its project manager, Darko Savic. We had asked them two years ago. We have made a very detailed assessment with experts and specialists. We have a contract with the United States that guarantees us a fixed price. And there is no risk. We have a clear position on this subject. The price is guaranteed. We have negotiated a special clause in the contract. This made the military expert we consulted smile. Is this Santa Claus's clause? I should have done some comedy. Sorry, but a special clause is like an imaginary friend. This contract will be governed by the American law. Why does Switzerland get better conditions than any other partner in the F-35 program? Without wanting to disrespect Switzerland, but who is more important to the United States as a strategic ally? Australia? Japan? Israel? Or Switzerland? Today, Viola Amert and her project manager, Darko Savic, have resigned. It is impossible to have their point of view. It should be noted that the former head of the F-35 program, the former head of the DDPS, was under intense pressure, and not only because of the choice of the F-35. A month before his resignation, in mid-December, she received a alarming letter. It was signed by the Parliamentary Finance Delegation, in charge of the financial surveillance of the great projects of the Confederation. It concerns 20 key projects of the DDPS, including the Israeli drones, but also other priority projects, such as the new radar system. Recent reports on key projects of the DDPS have allowed the Finance Delegation to notice with great concern that the state of these projects has deteriorated. These 20 projects represent 19 billion francs. In comparison, it is more than three times the price of the F-35s. So we are not counting peanuts. What a shame for the President of the Finance Delegation, the UDC's National Councilor, Lars Guglisberg. It is about effectively using the money of the contributors. The relationship between expenses and benefits must be favorable. We must use the money of the contributors with care, and it is our role to supervise this. The delegation targets in particular projects linked to the digital transformation of the army. The project is a project that is in the process of being completed. We were very concerned because all these projects have deteriorated. In other words, the risks have increased. There are several reasons for this. There were internal reasons, that is, internal governance did not work. There were also tensions between the different actors. The complexity of the projects was poorly evaluated. And then, of course, there were external factors. For example, delivery problems, quality defects, especially due to the geopolitical situation. This led to delays afterwards. And that is why we decided to write this letter. Well, basically, there is a bit of everything that has deteriorated. We are particularly interested in one of the projects mentioned in the letter of the Finance Delegation, that of the new monitoring system of the airspace, especially necessary to integrate the F-35s. Thanks to the transparency law, we have obtained a report on the management of the project commanded by the DDPS. We learn that the current radar system, Floraco, has taken such a blow that only the employees themselves, who are aging, have the necessary know-how to manage it. Problems? These experts will soon retire without being able to form their own companies. The new employees have resigned, discouraged. The audit denounces a calamitous management. Other resignations are not to be excluded due to the climate of dissatisfaction that reigns in the team. There is a high danger for operational exploitation if personnel erosion continues. The governance of the project is marked by a conflictual environment and a lack of confidence. We are talking about a layer of limon. This layer would prevent problems from rising towards the hierarchy. This report is the reflection of the moment when we really put the problems on the table. What comes out is quite serious. It shows the problems caused by the frictions within the administration. But now that everything has been put on the table, there is the possibility of reorganizing this project in a way that it is realized without these tensions, which are damaging. Because in the end, the objective is to ensure that the air forces remain really operational. It turned out that the complexity of this project has been massively underestimated. It is obviously very ugly. In addition, it turned out that the complexity of this project has been greatly underestimated. And that is of course one of the great tasks of the DDPS to ensure this governance. Our letter certainly had an impact. Within the DDPS, we are now trying to take the necessary measures to improve the situation. I take this letter seriously. I have created a specific division within the General Secretary to address these issues in a very targeted and open way. To manage them in the best possible way. It is essential to be able to use all our energy and all our financial means to strengthen our defense capabilities. He will need energy to not only face the discrepancies within the DDPS, but also to address the problems of the French government. He will need to be able to deal with the discrepancies within the DDPS, but also at the French government. Martin Pfister must indeed face a huge case of fraud and presumed corruption. RUAG MRO is the arms company in charge of the Confederation and under the responsibility of the DDPS. It is to it that the Federal Office of Arms, Armat Suisse, is in charge of new equipment or maintenance of the army's equipment. It is to it that the Federal Office of Arms, Armat Suisse, and the Federal Office of Arms, Armat Suisse, are responsible for the current situation. This story begins in 2016, when RUAG buys without any discretion 100 old Leopard 1 combat tanks and spare parts for the Italian army for 4.5 million euros. The idea is to resell them for a profit. Except that nothing happens as expected. The tanks are stored in northern Italy for years. In 2023, the German press reveals that RUAG tried to sell some of them to a German company for 500 euros, when it had bought them for 45,000 euros. But the case is also in chaos. This is why the Federal Office of Arms is concerned about the Confederation's financial gendarmes. During a first audit, we found that many transactions had been carried out and that they simply made no sense. Rent contracts were concluded that made no sense. This is what led us to carry out other checks in 2024. This is only the beginning, indeed. At the end of February, the Federal Office of Arms presented three devastating reports on RUAG. Today, the Federal Office of Arms reveals in an audit that the RUAG arms company has taken over the company for the first time in a long time. The company is now in a state of emergency. The company is now in a state of emergency. The company is now in a state of emergency. The company is now in a state of emergency. The company is now in a state of emergency. The company is suspected of a series of fraud. Dozens of millions of francs would be at stake. RUAG, the Confederation's arms company, is in the middle of a fraudulent traffic of detached parts. The famous combat tanks that we see here on these images of archives. A traffic of 2,500 pieces would have disappeared from military stocks. The scandal was already denounced in 2019 by a warning launcher. The warning launcher is precise. It details fraudulent transactions, and especially those presumed to be. In particular, a high-ranking company that would have illegally seized tens of millions. The superior of this company transmits the warning of the warning launcher. The company denies any fraud. And it is accepted by the management that it does not conduct any independent investigation. and it is accepted by the management that it does not conduct any independent investigation. What we have found concretely concerning this problematic collaborator is that he is not always recognized. And this is also a model that we always recognize in case of potential fraud. It is that the collaborators who generate a lot of business figures, who have a good position internally, generally benefit from a protective hand. And they can generally go further than what is allowed. This can become problematic, as in this case. The investigation is underway. The list of the infractions that could be blamed on the former staff is impressive. KNOW-HOW, FRAU transmutation, corruption, espionage économique, but this is not all. We realize even there is another problem, сюда the Julian UP UN The juliet directors that changes constantly. The management changes constantly. Legals control the activity. We are in the 19th century, and that allows people to use it and make a little bit of money on the case. At the department level, at the level of the Swiss Army, the RUAG and everything, we always tend to minimize because we don't have to actually entangle the image of the army and this system which actually manages a lot of money with a lot of power and a lot of secrets. What is so disturbing is that this scandal is far from being the first. We met another alert launcher, the aeronautical expert Thomas Schelliger. This Swiss has been conducting an aviation RUAG unit for three years, which he proposed to make more profitable by developing business with the private sector. I was really surprised when I was told, you know, of course, it would be nice to make money with sales in the private sector, but we don't need it. We will always receive more money than we need from the GDPR. And of course, I was totally amazed. So far, I thought we weren't capable of doing better. But then I understood that we didn't want it either. Why develop the business sector when we have a guaranteed source of money? And of course, that disappointed me a lot. He also denounces cross-border subsidies to finance the RUAG. In 2014, he started to alert his hierarchy without success, then he sends dozens of alert letters. This is the dossier I put back to the Federal Finance Control on June 7, 2016. These are the people I contacted. Here are the dates. Here are the people I contacted. Here are the dates. Here are the people I contacted. Here are the dates. Here are the dates. Here are the dates. Here are the dates. Here are the dates. And I give the explanation every time. These are all my interventions during five years. I contacted the security policy commissions, national advisers, advisers of the states, the finance department, the defense department. I went to see the public ministry. And everyone told me something like this, in summary. I said, yes, Thomas, you're probably right, but we're going to stay here. It's really a bullshit, but that's how it is. I heard that everywhere, and at some point, we just couldn't continue. RUAG is so political that you can only burn your fingers saying something. For six or seven years, I burned my fingers and nothing happened. It affected me a lot in my health. In 2015, I was in the hospital. I was hospitalized for almost two weeks. My life was just a thread. But I had enough vital energy to get out of there. In 2019, a financial control audit confirmed the cross-border subsidies. RUAG used in particular overpaid sums from GDPS to develop a civil aircraft. What to do today to put RUAG back on the rails? What to do today to put RUAG back on the rails? What to do today to put RUAG back on the rails? The army needs this company to work. The new Minister of Defence wants to give a big slap. Things like this in Switzerland, it's not the only one. It's very damaging. Absolutely, that's for sure. It's a big problem. A big reputation problem for RUAG. But what's important is that we're now taking lessons from it on the criminal side and on transparency. The corporate culture must be changed very quickly. I'm confident that we'll get there. But it was a problem, I promise you. We have to change that. What is this culture within the company that you want to change? It's obvious. A company must first respect the law. It's very important. It must have an internal culture of transparency. The problems start when everyone can do what they want and no one is aware of it. This culture of transparency and integrity must be established. Other industrial companies have done it. It's a central point. For sovereignty, RUAG. We're almost in the comic. It's so huge what we're discovering through the federal financial control investigations. It's almost a joke. I wouldn't say comic. It's rather tragic than comic. And there are things that I miss out on. In governance, there is something that is clearly drifting in a rather worrying way. And I think we must... And I think we must not only question people, but we must also question the system and the organization as it exists. There have been things that go beyond our understanding. The leopard-car case... It's out of the field of the understandable, indeed. Even for you, who were inside the system. Yes, but RUAG... I was inside the system as a militia officer. OK. I was the president of the Swiss office. But RUAG has always been a world apart. Always. RUAG scandal. Worries about the 20 projects worth 19 billion francs. The price of the F-35 is exploding. Disfunction within the GDPS. What is the responsibility of the former federal councillor in all this? Viola Amert has made efforts to reorganize the department. But she was constantly under pressure. I think we must be fair and say that despite all the mistakes she has made, she was under fire, fed with all kinds of political attacks. She tried to act and maneuver in this context. In any other European country, it would have been a huge government crisis, we agree. Absolutely. Absolutely. And not in our country? Well, no, not in our country. Why? Well, because Mrs. Amert resigned. She fled. She fled, in a way. At least that's how I feel. Leaving at that moment was really, if she wanted to fight and justify herself, a grave mistake. Why did they all leave at the same time? It's a funny, it gives a funny impression, anyway. There are different reasons why everyone left at the same time. It was a kind of coincidence. But each case must be judged individually. Especially the case of my predecessor. The reason she left. I don't want to comment on this here. It's up to her to do so. But today, we must seize this opportunity to change. I am optimistic that this will do the department good, especially with the arrival of new people with key functions. That you inherited from a department that has almost imploded. I don't share this observation. The army has always fulfilled its missions satisfactorily. It has well taken up these tasks. In other areas, too, I cannot see that we have not worked well. Of course, there have been problems of trust with the DTPS. We must once again restore this trust and highlight the excellent work done. In the meantime, the army, it continues to do what it has been doing. It is the only thing that remains of the DTPS. It is the only thing that remains of the DTPS. It is the only thing that remains of the DTPS. It is the only thing that remains of the DTPS. But it continues to do what it knows how to do, to train militia soldiers. At Lucie's shooting range near Romont, the DTPS inspects a weapon course for the officers of its battalion of carabinieri. So today I am here to perfect my shooting instruction and take with me tips and updates for the instruction of the soldiers during the repeat course that is coming up. So the purpose, in any case in the Swiss army, is not to go and fight, because we hope that it will never happen, but if it did happen, we would be ready for the fight. So that's why we train, that's why we do courses for the cadres, and that we have these repeat courses every year. So yes, the idea is to be ready for the commitment and not to be completely lost if one day it happens. Because in the context today, nothing is safe anymore. No, nothing is safe, and even being a neutral country, we cannot afford to think that it only happens to others and that nothing can happen. So no, we must be ready and keep up to date. Are you ready to engage in a real war? If I am ready, that's hard to say. We train for it, but I don't think anyone is ready to live a war. Because war is still violent, so when you see what is happening in some countries, you see that it is not a fun thing, it is not a game. But here in Switzerland, we train and we try to stay fit. In the holidays, the people who come into service today and who do the recruit training are mainly people who are motivated. There are so many ways to get out of the ranks. So it is important to admit that they are motivated people. They are really admirable young people. A few hours ago, they were in their office, in their profession. They transformed this morning with their uniforms and this afternoon they took up their weapons again to shoot. And it works! That's also a bit of the miracle of the militia. Now we can start. The first to speak is on the side of Robert Burton. Is the Swiss army credible today? I think it is. There is a lot of noise around what we call scandals or the various problems we have had to face in recent months. But the credibility of an army must be found in its roots. The roots are the people, the young militiamen who are here. I believe that the value of Switzerland, the value of the people, of everything we have created in this country, is something that is worth defending. We could talk about jewelry. Certainly, some will tell us that it is deteriorating. But despite everything, I think, and I am convinced, this country is worth it. And they know it. By the end of the year, the Federal Council must adopt a new security strategy for Switzerland, appoint a new army chief, appoint a new intelligence chief and manage hot files like the F-35. There have been big problems, real turbulence also from the DDPS. But I think we must not forget that it remains a pillar of our security. And we must not throw the institution into the water, if I may say so. We must now give a cap, keep a cap. There are very big projects for which we will have to invest a lot of money. So, the idea of having a much stricter project management is excellent. Getting ready, being ready is difficult. But not getting ready is a strategic mistake. We must understand that we are in a situation where we have to be prepared. We must understand that we are in a situation where we have to be prepared. We are in a historical turn. The period that followed the World Secondary from 1945 is over. The idea that we can build a security order based on rules, it seems to belong to history. The policy of power and return, the law of the strongest and return. I think we have to prepare ourselves mentally. What does this mean for a small state like Switzerland? A small globalized state, a free trade power at the heart of Europe. What does this mean for Switzerland? We have to agree on a basic consensus. That it is worth protecting freedom, democracy, the rule of law and an open society. To protect us from the seizure of authoritarian powers. We are in a situation that is similar to dark periods that we have already lived through, for which we have left. There is no reason why we are not leaving. But I think we are embarking on a difficult matter. And the indicators in terms of security policies that are in red are much more numerous than the indicators that are in green. It's like you're in a cockpit of a plane. If you have more red light than green light, you have to start worrying about where the next airport is. It's not going to go far, you have a serious problem. And so I think we really have reasons to worry. But we have to do it in a serene, calm, relaxed way. And once again, with the population. Worrying in a serene way is good in Swiss DNA. But we might have to worry a little more about the functioning of our Ministry of Defense and the good of the people. And the good use of the billions of francs that are now attributed to it.
