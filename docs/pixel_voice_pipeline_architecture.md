# Pixel Voice Pipeline: Production Architecture

## Overview

This architecture is designed for full production, clinical, and research-grade voice data processing, validation, and training data generation. It is modular, scalable, and supports advanced ML/NLP, clustering, and reporting.

## Key Modules

- **Audio Downloader & Preprocessor:** Parallelized download, format conversion, noise/silence removal.
- **Audio Quality Control & Segmentation:** SNR, loudness, silence, clipping, language detection, segment extraction.
- **Batch Transcription:** GPU-accelerated, diarization, speaker labels, confidence scores.
- **Transcription Quality Filtering:** Automated filtering based on confidence, language, and quality metrics.
- **Advanced Feature Extraction:** ML/NLP for speech patterns, emotion, empathy, personality, rhythm, etc.
- **Personality & Emotion Clustering:** Cross-sample clustering, drift detection, outlier analysis.
- **Dialogue Construction:** Multi-turn, context-aware, with integrated metadata.
- **ML-based Validation:** Empathy, authenticity, appropriateness, naturalness, using fine-tuned LLMs and classifiers.
- **Therapeutic Pair Generation:** Contextual, empathy-validated prompt-response pairs.
- **Reporting & Dashboards:** Automated reports, dashboards, and data exports for all stages.
- **Logging & Error Handling:** Centralized, structured logging and robust error handling at every stage.

## Data Flow

1. **Ingest:** Download and preprocess all audio.
2. **QC:** Run audio quality checks and segment as needed.
3. **Transcribe:** Batch transcribe with diarization and confidence.
4. **Filter:** Remove low-quality or off-target segments.
5. **Extract:** Run ML/NLP feature extraction on transcripts.
6. **Cluster:** Analyze and cluster for personality/emotion consistency.
7. **Construct:** Build dialogue and training pairs with metadata.
8. **Validate:** Run ML-based validation for empathy, authenticity, and appropriateness.
9. **Export:** Save final, validated data for training and research.
10. **Report:** Generate comprehensive reports and dashboards.

## Integration Points

- ML models for emotion, empathy, authenticity, clustering, and appropriateness.
- Configurable thresholds and parameters for all filtering and validation.
- Modular, testable scripts and/or pipeline orchestration (e.g., Airflow, Prefect, or custom runner).

## Next Steps

- Break down each module into actionable implementation tasks.
- Define data contracts and interfaces.
- Specify required ML models and validation datasets.
- Plan for automated testing and CI/CD integration.
