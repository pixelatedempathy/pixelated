Where are your thoughts right now? How normal is it to be constantly distracted? And when is it a disease? Can you still deal with just one thing for 45 minutes? And then also with ADHD, the attention deficit syndrome? If so, then you will learn a lot about yourself, about me and about people we know. Welcome to a world full of distractions. Thirty years ago, I treated ADHD as a doctor in child psychiatry. At that time, people thought that this Zappel-Philipp-Syndrome only affects boys and it grows. Today it is clear that neither is true. Girls are just as affected, but often show it differently. And many adults have ADHD without knowing it. Consciousness grows. Especially in social media. I sometimes don't understand this brain. If you have ADHD, you probably know the following problem. We have to think about it. When do I do this? How do I do this? Does this fit now? Our emotions are usually extreme. Do all of us have ADHD now? Is that fashion or a real blind spot of medicine? So I don't think I know anyone who has ADHD here and has no problems with drugs. What role do drugs play? Many of my colleagues speak openly about their diagnosis and I have one too. I have a lot of questions about it. I think it's important to know what you're talking about. I think it's important to know what you're talking about. I think it's important to know what you're talking about. I think it's important to know what you're talking about. What do I have to say? To give too much to say? For me, sale. Ón week in the future. 0. How quickly do you lose weight so that everything works perfectly? It's not quite that difficult. The biggest problem is the Dynasty rule. I want to have 1 Qu אניE of always having the most А совсем turnover. I want to see 3 thousand. Yeah. Oh my goodness. I've lived quite well without a diagnosis for 56 years, but it was and is also exhausting for me and especially for others. I can't really choose what I'm thinking about. Many ideas come into my consciousness without knocking at them at the same time. I constantly write notes and get lost. I want to meet people who are particularly familiar with the attention deficit syndrome, either as people who are affected or as medical professionals. When does thinking differently make you sick? At the hospital, I'm always on the phone with my friends. In the Franke family, it's loud in the morning. Two of the four children have been diagnosed with the attention deficit syndrome. For a long time, the parents were in doubt about their educational style. This desperation, how often we sat there in the evening and thought about what else we could do differently, what we were actually doing wrong. Hello, also on the table, there is food. Mathis! Can you hear me? Hello! Mathis is not only difficult to reach, but also hyperactive. The way to diagnosis was long and hard. I think it would have cost our marriage, really. I think we wouldn't be together or married if it had remained as it was. And I don't know, I think I would have been too exhausted for everything. I would have been too exhausted for everything. I would have been too exhausted for everything. I would have been too exhausted for everything. I would have been too exhausted for everything. I would have been too exhausted for everything. You're always in the head, that's how it feels for many affected people. Trapped in a spiritual video game hall. This is how Samira El Oaseel describes her life. Outside, it looks normal, she is a successful publicist, does podcasts, writes books and columns. Samira calls herself neurodiverse. With ADHS, the reward system in the head needs stronger impulses to jump on. At the same time, unimportant things are filtered out less well. This means constant overflowing of stimuli. What is your kick at such travel businesses? It is actually, I notice it biochemically, I notice it physically, that I am so scratched after it, because I am full of adrenaline, full of dopamine. And I also noticed that I was looking for and seeing these situations. So the normal world is actually too boring for you? At least too boring sometimes. I need to be in the right place. I sometimes need stimuli and stimuli to get another dopamine kick, which I fail to get because of my neurodivergence. While other people have this zero level, I need it quite normally, because I have to get out of the minus area into the zero area, much more. And for example, roller coasters totally help me. How are you? Are you excited? Yes, very good. Tell me why, why are you doing this? Because it's just so much fun. It goes on and on, way over there. It really doesn't take me. The roller coaster is an interesting delta werenas, I mean, even distance trip. You may like it to start with the round trip, It is believed that only children would have ADHD. But research now says that about 1.8 million adults in Germany are often affected by ADHD without knowing it. Starfleet Academy Recruitment Center. They mean us! Yes, they mean us! Off to new worlds! And not only do the affected suffer and need help. The families and friends also often despair about each other. Oh my God! Is this your world? Yes, how beautiful it is here! Neurodiverse people like Samira are constantly looking for new stimuli to find their inner biochemical balance and to take over the command in their head again. Only at the age of 38 does she get her diagnosis. It was really one of the most important moments in my life as a huge relief. Suddenly I understood why I was so unoccupied. And I always wondered what was wrong with me, why it didn't work for others. Or at least it looks like it doesn't work for them from the outside, as if they wouldn't fail so much in everyday life or suffer from it, not being able to do things. Did you have a pressure of suffering? I thought everyone has this pressure of suffering. And then I thought, okay, if everyone always has feelings of shame or guilt because they don't work in everyday life, that if everyone has this feeling that I can't stand it or that it's too much, to complain. How many people have gone crazy on you before you knew you were ADHD? I'm so sorry. I apologize to everyone. I actually attract the patience of a lot of people to the infinite. You have to be very careful with me, for example, when it comes to deadline. Or when I make deadlines, when I say I'll give it away tomorrow or I'll be there in an hour. In my case, another five minutes is an infinite journey. Today, Samira is doing much better with therapy and medication. There are many different variations in children and adults, in girls or boys. In 9-year-old Mathis, the external unrest and impulsiveness dominate. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. I have it. Come on. His sister, the 13-year-old Finja, is a bit more aggressive. She has ADHD, which is the lack of attention deficit syndrome. She lacks the tingly thing in contrast to ADHD, which is the lack of attention with hyperactivity disorder. The decision to treat her children with medication was not easy for the parents. My fear was that, you know it from before, in the 90s it first came up with this Ritalin. And I thought, oh, I'm going to die. You knew a few kids. I had children in the neighborhood who walked around like zombies. And I was just afraid that my child's character would just... I mean, she also had a lot of great sides. And I just didn't want it to be all so damp. Mathis is often not able to talk without medication. The homework was always a trial of tear-up. The homework situation. He sat down, wrote a number, stood up, and said, and walked around his desk twice. He sat down again. And then he thought, what have I done now? Then the next number. So we took hours. Mathis. Ah, that doesn't hurt. Mathis, Peter. Yes, he was fine. He was fine. Yes, he was fine. Yes, he was fine. Yes, he was fine. Yes, you went faster. Yes, he was fine. Yes, I went fast. Ah, he joyed a lot that day. I was fine. The teacher was CDs. Then I thought, what point were I at? My son is just one age below the average age of 10. And he doesn't fit. Daha, isn't it just me that I need all the slides to go precisely? I have no idea how such a small clip looks. Last time I went with 10 points. How did I get 10 points, you start out with 10 points. I thought things got a little confusing then. But then I decided, that's it. After this coming up, you tried out a little, but that further increased on you, but then quite magically it's true. Now we're in the fast-controlled. You don't understand, but the most interesting thing is, I'm one of the best students in the class. Yes, that's right. Mattis has been taking ADHS medication every day for a year and is doing well. After half an hour they start to work, until the evening, then the effect is restored. We also get feedback from school. The teacher then calls and says, can it be that Mattis has forgotten his tablet? Because it's just another child, so unabashedly, on the axis. Statistically, every school class has a child with ADHS. The prescription of methylphenidate, the active ingredient of Ritalin or Medicnet, has doubled in the last 20 years. This evokes skepticism. We calm the children down. That's always the accusation that this medication is bad. There are many prejudices associated with it. Also real disinformation campaigns. This is under heavy pressure, although the effect is actually completely undisputed. There is no medication in psychiatry that has a higher so-called effectiveness, that is, is more effective. Andreas Reif has been researching the treatment of ADHS for a long time. Impulsivity, missing priorities, distractibility, many know that. But is that ADHS? ADHS is like a very large body size. We are all somehow big and from a certain point on we would somehow feel it as pathological. This is obviously not a problem with body size. But with behavioral stimuli, everyone of us is more or less inclined to put ADHS-like behavior on the table. Some very little, some very much. And when it comes across a certain limit and problems result from it, then we call it ADHS. The core of ADHS is a combination of three difficulties. Less attention to one thing. Less foresight and being able to stay on track. Medicine calls for three different types of symptoms. First, the hyperactive ones, which appear restless, ticklish and slightly irritable. Second, the unnoticeable ones. They are easily distractible, have problems listening, because their thoughts are rushing. And third, the mixed type. Girls often manage to hide the symptoms better. In the third grade, Finja was like that. That she somehow just had self-esteem. That she said, I know everything, but I can't show it or I can't write it down. And that was the point for us. That we said, we don't want it like that. We don't want the child to develop a depression or something. Despite her high intelligence, Finja couldn't get along well without medication at school and in the family. I would just wish that this ADHS disappears, that it's not so strong anymore, that I don't have to take any more pills. For five years, Finja has been taking methylphenidate every morning. She's been taking it for a long time. And now she's not feeling well. And now she's not feeling well. Then we tried it out and there was no day left. That was really, you too. Me too. Yes? Yes. When? Finja doesn't like pills. Yes, I hate that. I always had the feeling that I was a little bit like, I don't know, like, uh, I don't know. Yes, you are. But I don't have that feeling anymore, like, you know, the feeling of hunger. I'm very hungry, but I don't have an appetite. That means when I come home from school, I'm usually so hungry, but I don't eat anything because I don't have an appetite. Yes, that's clearly a side effect. But that's shit. Appetite-free is a typical side effect of the medication that makes many children and young people to create. But in the scale, the best way is still the best way, say the parents and professionals, to avoid side effects. Finja was lucky that her ADS was recognized, unlike many other girls and women. They are overlooked far too often because they do not correspond to the cliché of Zappe Philipps, as with Samira El Oasile. Women can compensate well, are often more socially intelligent, the unrest goes inwards and less outwards, and the question of the citizens is also more important. The question marks in the diagnosis are more about recognizing the hyperactive type. If you look up at your life, do you feel sorry for these many decades without diagnosis? I definitely feel a little regret, because what some people are not so aware of in relation to ADHS is that it is not the very big catastrophes, but rather the accumulation of so many small moments, so many small moments of failure in everyday life. And then also on such small things, which then make the damage that you cannot do it even greater. Because you think, why can't I do it, somehow to get my mail back, or to send the right packages, or not to lose things that are expensive and valuable. Since Samira takes medication against her ADS, it is going much smoother in everyday life. What is important is to find out, it is not at all about being an optimized person afterwards, or working better, or not being able to do it. The handling of small challenges is suddenly a different one, namely no longer so much a fear-affected person, not even a guilt-affected person. And that just makes life more valuable. There is an explanation for the difficulties in thinking, planning and acting. The transmission of the stimulus, i.e. the information from one nerve cell to the next, takes place with the help of botulism. But these are often not available in sufficient quantities in certain brain regions in ADHS learning. Here, drugs with the active ingredient methylphenidate are used. They strengthen the transmission of information, and then you can concentrate better again. But that stuff doesn't pop up, in the sense that you are not high when you take a drug like betaline. Interestingly, not exactly. That is the difference with a neurodivergent person. And that is why I also call ADHS a kind of diabetes in the head. So there is simply a biochemical insufficiency. And that makes the change ... And there is no character insufficiency. Exactly. Because someone who has diabetes, you wouldn't say, yes, have you ever tried good music? Or, ah, your parents must have misled you that you have diabetes now, or something like that. That would never be heard by someone who has diabetes. Now I have told you an incredible amount about my experience. What are the aspects where you think you have recognized yourself again? In many respects, to be honest. Of course, I have already worked as a doctor in practice, in children's and youth psychiatry, with a large number of boys who were so hyperactive. Also always comforted with, well, I'm not like them. And what I find totally exciting is that we underestimated how many different variations there can be. And that only because you don't have this hyperactive, you can still have a lot to do with other facets of ADHS. The encounter with Samira made me think. Do I have that too? At the university clinic in Bonn, I have an appointment with an ADHS expert for adults. Diagnostics include conversations, test questions and the sight of relatives. So I'm already trying to prioritize tasks. I'm trying to keep order, to keep up with the times. And that sounds to me like they're the share of ADHS. Of course, there's a little bit more to it. What do you think? What's especially striking for adults? Often it's the difficulty to organize everyday life, to set priorities, to keep deadlines. So there should still be a foreign I was also bored in my memories and then I kind of started talking nonsense. And my mother says so too. I already had the ability to get excited about things. I started as a child with magic and card tricks and always had something in my hands and always practiced something. Maybe that was also a kind of me to deal with this inner unrest. Neither an MRI nor a blood test can prove ADHS to exclude at most other diseases. Here in virtual reality, my brain waves are measured while I try not to be distracted by the chaos in a virtual classroom. Not easy. In school, of course, I was the one with the paper plane. But now I have to concentrate. Stop with the crap. Maybe in the future ADHS symptoms will also be objectively measurable on the computer. You know a lot about my inner self. You also know the question, Bögen. Does that give you a coherent picture? Overall, I have the impression that ADHS has something to do with it. There are certainly people who are even more affected. And they were also able to compensate a lot. With stimulation, with impulsiveness. Earlier they said they actually led three lives in parallel. So I would say from the first impression, also with the look-alike, with the question arches, that it is so moderately shaped. Does that fit as a moderator? Yes, exactly. That fits as a moderator. Otherwise it would have been the job. Good to know. Dr. Philipsen gave me a few behavioral therapy tips right away. In particular, sports help against inner unrest and a self-reliant environment for work. If blood pressure and thyroid values ​​are okay, then I can also take medication. I can also try it. 130 to 90. No, of course I'm worried. Part of my job is to react quickly. And one thing is impulsive, the other is ... But if you think about it three times, whether this is adequate in the situation now, then the moment for the spontaneous reaction is over. And that's exactly the point. You can get that out by trying it. It is indeed the case that people say that the peaks of creativity, of association, are being cut off a bit. And then it makes sense to adjust the dose. The lack of chemical balance makes it more risky on the one hand, but also more susceptible to drugs. Investigations in prisons show that 40% of all young male inmates have an ADHS, many untreated. One of them is Tim. Do you think it's fair that you are in prison? For all the things I did, I always sat down. I got a lot of chances, a lot of election penalties. Tim was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for heavy robbery. He was drug-addicted for a long time and was therefore always fined. Would you say you have ADHS? Yes. I always had a higher or stronger drive to move, I would say. I always knew that something was separating me from other people. And then there were the first people who said, yes, maybe you have an ADHS. Well, at the time, when I was 17, 18, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, it was like, oh, ADHS, that's something bad. You're sick, you're seriously ill. No, I don't have anything like that. That also had a long time ... First of all, nothing to do with it anymore. Yes, exactly. Prejudices against mental illnesses often prevent the affected from seeking and receiving help. Tim trains in the prison for a half marathon. That does him a good job. Sport is particularly effective in building up the inner tension and creating legal moments of happiness. Tim's replacement for drugs. Did the drugs contribute to you feeling better? A bit in the idea of ... It's also a bit of self-medication. Yes, exactly. 99%, if not 100% of my consumption was self-medication. In any case. At least that was the reason at the beginning. Surely that's ... At some point, the addiction ... Drugs have brought me a certain peace of mind, which I could not ... Yes, or could not reach. That's the way it is. I'm getting a little bit of it now. And I would have been a little bit more comfortable if I had been able to get it. But I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. If I had gotten some more of Medikinet, I would not have gone to the hospital. Because Medikinet does exactly what drugs do to me now. They make me calmer or they put on a kind of glasses on me. I feel a lot better now. I've been clean for two years now. And there are worlds between me and what I used to be. A big advantage is also for Medikinet. You don't go to jail. Exactly. That's one reason, yes. Certainly, yes. The consequences are dramatic. So that can already have serious consequences for the individual. We didn't recognize the disease and didn't treat it. Not to mention that ADHS often comes with side diseases, depressive disorders, especially anxiety disorders. Addiction diseases are to be mentioned here, but also physical diseases such as overweight and the resulting consequences, which can be prevented almost by all if the disease is diagnosed and treated early. Studies show that if you treat prisoners with ADHS, the rate of relapse decreases significantly. ADHS people need recognition, love, self-efficacy and success experiences like everyone else. They often experience the opposite. Failure, shame, rejection and break-up. Half of them become depressed. We could improve a lot as a society if we just looked at it. Finally, we have it, we have it. Alexandra Philipsen knows that many parents also despair when they have to look at how their loved ones are running with them and their life. We in Germany love the question, who is to blame? Are the parents to blame? Definitely not. That's a big topic. So also why it is probably so stigmatized when a child shows ADHS symptoms, that the question quickly arises, are the parents to blame? Single father, single mother, are they too strict, are they too little strict? You can definitely say that ADHS is something that is very strongly genetically determined. Environmental factors can play a role, but it is clearly a family genetic component and no one is to blame. That's the way it is. You would never criticize anyone for their body size. We as a society give away so much and many people suffer unnecessarily. In Germany, prisoners are only treated in individual cases on ADHS, also because excessive fears of drug trafficking are in the way. Here in the JVA Meppen, it is better treated without any precautions. Kim Kleine-Löckte works with full conviction as a psychiatric care specialist with the imprisoned. Why is it that ADHS diagnoses are more frequent here than the 2-3% that you usually have? I would guess that the ADHS patients outside are medicated with drugs themselves and possibly therefore also have a chance of becoming more criminal. And that's why they are more present here. What is the best thing that can happen here? If they stay drug-free, if they simply manage their everyday life here, if they work permanently. It really happened often that they said, the JVA saved me. Outside I would have been destroyed and I would have continued. The JVA Meppen The JVA Meppen The JVA Meppen If you have thought so much about ADHS as you have, you probably recognize it faster with others. Would you say, there are a few people here? I don't think I know anyone who has an ADHS here and has no drug problem. I often ask myself, how else would life have developed if you had known in advance that I had something to do with it? I ask myself this question almost every second day. Or if not every day, I say to myself, man, if you had known that I had it 10, 15, 20 years earlier, or if you had known that I had it from me, even though you said you might have an ADHS, where I perceived it as something bad, because that's actually quite ... The thing is, an ADHS is, let's say, maybe with autism, one of the only diseases or a few that actually have advantages. Which disease has advantages? Which? In certain things, you are faster. ADHSs are ... ADHSs are quite empathetic. Then, you can coordinate a lot of fast things at the same time. You just have to find the right thing in life with your ADHS. So it's clear that an ADHS-er should always do the same if he's not on the bandwagon. An ADHS-er always wants to make new bones. And if he does that, if he can somehow develop in this environment, then it's an achievement for everyone. What kind of superpowers do ADHS-ers have from your experience? They are incredibly burdensome. And somehow also stand-up people. They really fall on their noses often, they drive their carts against the wall and then a new idea comes up. I find that impressive. I find them very open in contact and curious. That's fun too. Yes, and unconventional. You can only live forward. You can only understand life. Sometimes only backwards. One of my strengths was always to come up with new ideas when telling freely. That is sometimes unfavourable when dictating doctor's letters. But on stage, that's an advantage. I was always in my element. I once had a long-term ECG. And it was really funny to see that what would stress many people, namely to speak in front of 3,000 people, made me calm. Wanted it to be true and effective. Addортive. facultative. When I woke up that's all scattered inlung. How would people see you if you were a musician? Or Имte cardinal. Do they have replicas in the parece dirigio in Germany? She is from Andorra. It's her first time going to a clinic and inadımofob 때� wir herá in here. For studying meet her. Do you recognize them from earlier? Yes! People with ADS can easily connect things that remain in drawers with others. That became my recipe. Mixing magic with cabaret, medicine with humor. But not many are lucky to find the right environment to bloom. On the contrary, there is a lack of knowledge, of starting points, especially for young people. They often find no help. Especially in the youth, when it gets too critical, when substances are consumed, sexual contact, teenage pregnancies, incidences, serious accidents, deaths, it breaks down to the maximum. And that means that especially the young adults are in a gap of under-supply, of under-diagnostication. There is this accusation, yes, this is actually an invention of the pharmaceutical industry, they want to get rid of their stuff. Who deserves ADHS? I would put it the other way around. What does ADHS cost us? What does it cost us? A lot. Thousands of millions of euros a year. There are zig investigations. We know that ADHS is a risk factor for further mental illnesses. That's what society costs. And above all, it costs the individual life time and quality of life. I had one patient, really years ago, who was very, very impressive. One of the first. They are particularly characteristic. He told me, as a child, he would go to the milk shop in the morning, as soon as he got up. And the milk had still been there for several weeks in the morning. And when he got up starting, I was not feel sick. The nurse said, well, what did you do that time, or were you out more than ten minutes? Was that the result? He was very successful. It really took a turn. There are so many crazy fates that I am happy to know only moderate parts of ADHS. An important part of the journey in my head is still out. What happens when I take the drugs? I need a little restlessness and a little craziness in my world. And I don't want to let that happen. Do I do pharma advertising now? No. It is important to me to say that I take drugs. I don't take it for fun. I take it because I want to know if my life will actually become easier, as Samira described it, for example. And I also want to know if the percentage of ADHS that I have can be confirmed. Because drugs for people with ADHS work differently than for people without. It is a test. There are different causes for ADHS. There is a large proportion of genetic factors. But alcohol and smoking in pregnancy also increase the risk, as they can negatively affect brain development in the mother's body. For over 30 years, the psychiatrist Ralph Myers has been treating children and adults with a deficit of attention. It sounds paradoxical, but he is optimistic that the brain can learn better with the drugs, so that at some point you no longer need the drugs. Once ADHS does not always mean ADHS. If you walk through the area half blind, half deaf, then a glasses and a hearing aid will logically help you. If you walk completely unconcentrated through the area and you get a drug that produces the concentration now, then you get information that your brain can start with and then expand its capabilities. And when I learned that, I need less and less of this support. Ralph Myers is taking a test developed in Sweden for diagnosis. He measures attention, impulse control and concentration. And that even works on the phone. Progresses in treatment can be measured and controlled so easily. What is the most important thing for you? In this case, this is a girl who is untreated at this time and is 15 years and 7 months old. And we have the image of a fugitive ADHS. Here the restlessness is fixed. Down here we have a lot of fugacity. And now comes the first control under treatment, in this case methylphenidate, two weeks later. And we see what has changed, namely the fugacity has decreased significantly, the restlessness has decreased. And the interesting thing now is that we can see the same patient here again, at just under 20 years old. And now she is so far that she no longer needs medication. Restlessness still noticeable, yes, but therefore no load pressure. Down here, under the highest requirements, very, very good ability to cope. This young woman is out of the question. People with a deficit of attention can learn to manage their symptoms better. Ralph Myers uses completely different approaches for this, the so-called multimodal therapy. Medicines, behavioral therapy, computer-based brain training and much more. As diverse as the people are, the things that help them can be so colorful and different. The goal is always to be able to be medication and treatment-free at some point. It is completely clear to me that I cannot achieve this with all patients. If one treatment option brings a little success, but not enough, then I may have to go another way at the same time and a third. And then I got there. So I really have thousands of cases that I now overlook in over 30 years. And in most cases we can achieve this. Medicine thought too long ADHS, that's changing. That's why young adults and adolescents fall into a supply chain. If children's medicine is no longer responsible, but no one else. Maybe that's why ADHS is a social media trend. Lisa Vogel explains with videos on the internet about ADHS, explains the diseases, how to find help. She knows what she's talking about. She was treated wrong for 15 years. Your energy level looks something like this. It always goes from mega high to mega low and no one can predict how long such a phase will last. These are phases, usually hyper focus or something new has started, new job, new routine. New friend. Well, who knows? I was a little different as a child. And that quickly turned into depressive behavior, fear behavior and also in school. There have been long times in my life, actually the complete twenties, where I first left the apartment relatively rarely. I had hardly any social contacts, hardly any friends. And when I met friends, I always drank alcohol and always drank a lot of alcohol. And that of course eventually also developed into a addiction. ADHS as a trigger for her difficulties was long overdue. Lisa is not an isolated case. There are hardly any specialized specialists for adults, but no treatment without diagnosis. Only 5000 from her Instagram community are currently waiting for an appointment for first diagnosis. Yes, I have now read today from someone who was happy to get an appointment after 17 months. And that's why I think it's so problematic that it's torn online like that with self-diagnosis or that you take care of it yourself. Because what should you do if you have the first suspicion, should you then lock yourself up for a year? Lisa found her way without medication and gets to know her ADHS better every day. To the last chapter of my journey. Am I a different person with medication? No. At first I felt little of it. I even felt like I was becoming more restless rather than more concentrated. But I also paid more attention to my stomach than ever before. What has totally calmed me is that I am interactive with people a lot when I give lectures. That I approach them, that I react spontaneously, also thoughts. And I don't think that's lessened. That was a bit of my worry. That I somehow become too predictable and boring. And that, thank God, didn't happen. The Franke family struggles with their challenges every day. Two of the four children have ADHS and both parents see strong parts of themselves. Mathis gets along well with the medication. He notices it clearly when the effect is left on the evening. I notice it very special too. Because I always change. I always become active. It's also sometimes a bit uncomfortable. Because I always consume so much energy. And I'm sometimes very fast out of breath. Mother Annika wants more understanding. I find it sad that neurodiverse people simply don't have this right of presence in our society. Like neurotypical people. So I fight for that too. How important it is for me to just un-pathologize this thing. And to say, we are all different people. We have strengths and weaknesses. And I think our system should simply change. To make it easier for people like me and my family. And also to give a value. Neurodiverse people are more vulnerable than adults. In a world that tends to create more and more distractions. Being online is a constant temptation, especially for people with a lack of attention. Fortunately, I'm still outside with a lot of free time. And without a cell phone. Who knows how many hours I would have been dabbling in the screen as a teenager. And of course, being online always imitates me. How nice it is to talk about psychological burdens today much more self-evident than back in my generation. And that makes it easier for me to show myself with my own personal story and hopefully contribute to raising awareness. help. Hey, hello! It's also shining in the dark. Hello, you too, you're shining too. Thanks for waiting. No, no problem. You're welcome. For three weeks I have tried two different active ingredients after talking to the doctor who is treating me. I wanted to know if the chaos in the head could be reduced a bit and the concentration increased. It was a strange moment to take this drug for the first time. And then it didn't really make a noticeable difference to me. But then I talked to the doctor again and she said, well, then try something else. And I found that enlightening and actually focusing. And what you described, it also went so that I noticed how such an inner calmness, which was beautiful, came. Has the treatment changed me? No, I can still do well without medication. I take it when I have particularly stressful and demanding days or when I run into danger of being particularly annoying to others. How helpful is this idea of neurodivergences, of a kind of kind of a natural emergency, spectrum when our whole health insurance and care system actually only knows two conditions, namely you have it or you don't have it. And once you get a claim and the other is your private problem. I think it's really important that we understand that health is so much more than the absence of measurable symptoms, so to speak. Am I able to move with others? Am I happy with others? Are they happy with me? I think communication about it is also important and helpful, because only then do people realize that what they perceive as their normal, but as exhausting normal, may not even be normal for their lives, but that something is a little different with them. And this knowledge can save lives, can save biographies, can save families. More important than any other drawer or diagnosis is the question of what protects our mental health, what helps each individual. How good can a life be if we are strong and weak? Alone and connected. Quite normal and please also a little colorful. John Churchill
