 Well welcome to another Friday night. We're moving along in our series on pulling all of the 85  characteristics of complex trauma together in summary form and today I come to the last ones  that come out of shame. So what we saw is that complex trauma. One of the most damaging effects is it  changes the identity of a child from positive to negative. So it creates the shame identity that I'm  not good enough. Something's wrong with me. I'm not lovable. I'm not valuable. And so that then  results in all kinds of different characteristics that come out of that which are the brain trying  to solve shame. The brain trying to feel better about oneself, the brain trying to get others to  feel to respect you trying to hide that true identity. And so what we've seen is there's over 20  different characteristics that come out of just shame. So today I want to wrap that part up. And the  first one I want to look at is manipulation. So in a healthy home, a child's able to be authentic.  They can trust that those in authority want the best for them. And so they openly communicate  their needs. They openly communicate their desires, their dreams. And they're listened to. They're  heard. The parents are understand them and get them. And so the child doesn't have to try to  manipulate anybody to get their needs met. They just communicate their needs and know that the  parents want what is best for the child. And the child trusts that. But in complex trauma,  it's very different. So the child follows those healthy instincts initially. They communicate  their needs. They communicate their desires. They're authentic. But those get left at. Those get  punished. Those get shame. And the child begins to feel something's wrong with me. I'm not good  enough to have needs as to be rejected. So they still have needs. But how do they get those needs  met? They can't just express them honestly. So the child has to begin to learn to manipulate.  It's the only way of survival. It's the only way of getting their needs met. Now we've done  an entire video around manipulation tactics in the boundary series. But let me just kind of give you  the highlights of the main manipulation tactics that a child begins to learn. So the one, the first  one is love bombing. And that is, if I'm super, super, super nice to you. If I give you lots of  things, then you'll want to give me something back. So it's a way of manipulating by being super  nice. And children learn to do that. They bring their dad coffee. They do extra chores for dad.  And then they want to ask dad for something. The second one is using guilt. And so many think of  this in terms of how their parents try to manipulate them. If they're, if they set a boundary with  their parents, and the parents say, after all we've done for you, you are so selfish. And it's  basically trying to create a feeling of guilt in the child that they're a selfish, unappreciative  child that then causes them to, okay, I'll do whatever you want, just don't just to get rid of the  guilt. Then some begin to use false accusations. So they misrepresent the story. So some children,  they'll tell you a situation. And they only tell you 75% of it. They leave out a few details.  They only include the details that make you want to help. That make you think the child is  asking for something very reasonable. So they learn to manipulate the truth in order to manipulate  people. Others, they will have, again, think in terms of their family, where their family will  falsely accuse them of stuff in order to get them to go, no, that's not me. I'll prove you wrong.  So they go, you think you're better than us. You don't value your family. All you think of is  yourself. And so now that the person goes, no, that's not true. I'll give you whatever you want,  I'll do whatever you want, just so you don't think badly of me. So false accusations is a tactic  used to manipulate people. Then a big one within complex trauma families is fear,  the threat of violence, the threat that if you tell this secret, if you tell anybody about this,  I will hurt you, I will hurt your sister, I will kill you, or many children begin to go,  I'm going to go commit suicide. If you don't do what I want, I'll kill myself. And that fear  causes the people to do whatever they want. Another one is anger and intimidation. And so  that fear of angry people. So if you become very intimidating, if you get angry, I'll do whatever  you want. Just don't be angry at me. So it's a powerful manipulation tool. Then some go more  passive aggressive. And it's, I'm going to punish you if you don't give me what I want. So I will  withhold love. I will pout. I will give you the silent treatment. I'll be super cold to you.  I'll give you one word answers when you want to connect. I will push your buttons on purpose  just to get you angry. So I am going to punish you for not giving me what I want. Others, they  learned an egg. If you say no the first time, that's all right. I'll just keep asking until you  get tired of me asking and give in and say yes. Some resort to begging. I would do whatever you  want. Please just give me this. I beg of you. And so it's just lording themself to that  servile place of begging just to get what they want. Others create a crisis. So you set a boundary  with your mom. Let's say I can only see you once a week when you mom's been used to seeing you  every day. Mom doesn't like that. And so all of a sudden mom creates a crisis. Oh, I'm having a  hard time. I really, really, really need you just to get you to go and spend more time with her  more frequently or people propose a compromise. So we won't date anymore, but how be we still be  just be friends or how we still go for a coffee once in a while. So you're still manipulating to  keep the relationship. You're just formally saying it's no longer a relationship. Then there's  triangulation. So this is where mom's upset that you've set a boundary and are only going to visit  once a month. She may have tried all the other things to guilt trip you to create a crisis and  you haven't given in. So now all of a sudden you get a phone call from your aunt. And it's very  concerned about your mother. She's not sleeping well. And I think it's because you're not seeing  her very often. And so now you're getting a third party that is voicing mom's request. Then you  can get all they can then start including all kinds of different friends and family members who  start coming and taking you aside and talking to you and putting pressure on you to go back to do  what mom wants. So these are called hooks where the person who doesn't like the boundary is trying  to hook you back to the old boundary and they're manipulating you by playing off different emotions  to get you to go back to the old boundary. And then some people they recruit support not just  from family, not just through triangulation, but they go, wow, I was on Google and I found out all  this information that you need to see your mother more regularly. And they present all the experts  say evidence to try and add pressure to you. So manipulation, if that became a child's way of  surviving, to come into recovery and to realize manipulation absolutely destroys trust and  relationship. It causes people to suspect there's always a hit in gender agenda. They suspect that  they're going to be used somehow that the truth that you're saying is not actually what you're  what's really going on. It just begins to destroy, break down, trust, intimacy, connection,  relationships. You begin to feel this relationship is not about love. This is relationship is about  them trying to use me. And so in recovery you go manipulation has to go. I have to learn to be  open and honest and vulnerable about my needs and desires. So again, understand you can only do  that with safe people. It won't work with unsafe people. They will use it against you. So you need  safe people. But as you begin to get honest about your needs, it creates fear. Fear that you're  going to be rejected. Fear that people are going to see you as a burden. Fear that people are going  to say no and not like you and set up more boundaries with you. And so you have to fight through fear.  So what I'm hoping you see in a lot of these things is to heal actually triggers fear.  To get healthy actually triggers a fear response that wants to go back to unhealthy.  And so you got to fight through that fear and say no, I know my cortex. This is healthy. I have to  stick to the plan. And usually you find while it was worth it. The next characteristic that comes  at a shame is this you long for intimacy, but you're afraid of intimacy. So a child again has these  built in longings that are all connected to wanting connection intimate relationship. They want to  be authentic. They want to be known intimately. They want to be fully accepted. They want to share  that with another person and experience not just physical intimacy, but they want to experience  a deeper intimacy that comes from a deep knowledge of a person shared values, shared passions,  shared beliefs, a deep understanding of that person and acceptance of that person. Healthy  meaningful relationships come out of that deepening intimacy that contains vulnerability,  authenticity, total acceptance, total validation and knowledge of each other. That is such a powerful  thing that comes to complex trauma again. A child tries to follow all of those longings to be  authentic, to connect, to have intimacy, to be known, to be heard. And they get ashamed, they get  punished, they get rejected, they get hurt over and over again. And so they go intimacy always ends up  in getting hurt. But the longing for that deep intimacy doesn't disappear, especially when they  get into their teen years, into their 20s. They just long for that companionship, that deep connection,  that deep relationship intimacy. But they go, I'm afraid of it. I'm afraid if I go down that road,  I'm going to get hurt badly. And so they long for it, but the fear keeps them from pursuing it.  So what they tend to do is the next characteristic, and that is they go for pseudo-connection,  fake connection. So I can't have true deep intimacy. Let's have kind of a fake false intimacy.  Let's do things that make us feel connected, but not at a deep, deep level. So they give feelings  of connection, but there's no total authenticity, total acceptance, total vulnerability. It's trying  to get intimacy without authenticity, intimacy without vulnerability. That's what they're going for.  So just think of much of our culture today. It is based really around people chasing, fake intimacy,  surface intimacy, pseudo intimacy, not genuine real connection. So they long for feelings of intimacy,  they are afraid of true intimacy. So bar room environments, lots of laughter, lots of fun, lots of  storytelling, lots of warm emotion. Everybody feels like a buddy, but nobody's talked about anything  of any significance. The conversations only went a millimeter deep. You think of team sports.  You have a shared goal. Everybody's striving together for the shared goal. They're in the same  struggle. You experience victory, defeat together, the hard work, the coming together, laughter,  a family environment. It feels so close, so connected. But nobody talks at a deep level.  It's the feelings of closeness without the actual authenticity and vulnerability. And that's  what happens often in many military settings in gang type of settings. You're in a shared goal,  shared conquest, shared struggle. Everybody's coming together. Everybody's feeling close, acting close,  but there's no true, deep intimacy. Then you get people that come together with a shared common  interest, a shared trauma, a shared goal, a shared hobby. They bond over one topic. They connect  over being able to open up about one topic. Sometimes when they open up about that one topic,  it goes deep. It gets raw. It gets real. There's emotions involved. There's vulnerability in one  area. There's coming together, shared goals and desires and passions in one area. You go,  we're so close. But that's only in one area. That's only one part of you. You don't know the rest  of the person. So it creates strong, intense feelings of connection, but only around one area.  So I hope what you realize is surface connection, pseudo connection. Yeah, there's a place for it.  But it's meaningful to a degree. It gives good warm feelings, but it's not true connection. It  doesn't satisfy the deepest, longings of the heart. It's not based on true authenticity and  vulnerability. It's based on hiding. It's based on not being authentic totally. So what again,  I want you to understand is we all need deep intimacy. We all need true connection.  Surface connection is great in superficial friendships and casual friendships, but we need a soul  meet. We need close friends where there's total authenticity, where there's ability to be  totally vulnerable, where there's acceptance, where it's safe to do all of that, where we're  understood, where people get us. We share all parts of life, intellectual, emotional, relational,  spiritual. That's what we need to get healthy. And so in recovery, it becomes very important to  at least try to find one person that you can begin to gradually build towards deeper and deeper  intimacy, deeper and deeper connection. Now, you have to be careful because a lot of people they  go to physical intimacy too quickly. And all of a sudden they go, oh, we got physical intimacy,  we're really close, we're in a relationship. And they forget all about the other forms of intimacy.  Really work at I want to have soul intimacy. There has to be getting to know each other,  a deep knowledge, shared experiences, talking about a broad range of things, sharing all kinds of  difference emotions. Then, as we do that gradually over time, there's this growing sense of  connection and intimacy. That's where the focus needs to be. So, I need to add this, for some  people who basically as a child and complex trauma say, intimacy always results in pain. Therefore,  forget relationships. But they still have a desire for connection and intimacy. And so what they  then do is discover, usually by a fluke, that if they connect to certain activities, it gives  the feelings of intimacy. It releases chemicals in the brain that make you feelings of connection.  So, what we've learned is when people engage in sex or watch porn, releases oxytocin,  releases dopamine, releases serotonin. Those are the chemicals of connection.  And so people now go, who needs relationships? I can just do these activities. And it gives me  the feelings of connection. And that seems to satisfy others. They get that through eating food.  Others, they get that through shopping. They get that through playing video games. Some even find  it in drugs and alcohol. And so the point is this. Our brain is driven to find deep connection.  If you're not going to find it in human relationships, it will find it in activities. It will find  it in things that produce the same chemicals. The problem is, is that without the true connection  happening, those chemicals don't satisfy. Those chemicals give you a thrill for a little while,  but leave you empty again, because your deep connection needs are not being met. And it sets a  person up for addiction. It sets a person up to pursue sex, porn, gambling, food, shopping,  video games. I just need more. I just need more. I just need more. And then they become addicted.  So again, healthy connection is what living is about. It's what recovery is about. It is such an  important aspect of life. Let me take you to the next characteristic. And that is people with deep  shame issues coming out of complex trauma have jealousy issues. So shame is convinced that if you  get in a relationship, your partner is eventually going to find somebody better than you. That there's  a whole lot of fish in the sea. And shame believes I'm not a very important fish. There's a whole lot  of better catches out there than me. That's the bottom line belief of shame. So shame believes that  if I'm in a relationship, it proves that I'm lovable. If I'm not in a relationship, that must  therefore give proof that my shame belief is the truth. I am not lovable. Anyway, it's no  me has rejected me. Therefore, if I'm in a relationship, I must not lose that relationship.  I have to hang on to that relationship to continue to convince myself that I'm lovable,  to solve my shame is what it's really trying to do. But there's another component that comes out  of complex trauma that feeds into jealousy. Most people with complex trauma, children, it's not just  that they lived in an environment where their knees weren't met where they didn't feel safe.  They were betrayed by their parents. They experienced the violation of trust over and over again.  Promise is broken. Parents not being there for them. Not being able to depend on these  parents to meet their needs, to care for them, to nurture them. And so betrayal trauma is part of  complex trauma. Violation of trust is part of complex trauma. And so now, when they get in a  relationship, they expect to be betrayed. They can't trust anybody. Trust, if you trust somebody,  you're setting yourself up to get hurt. So that feeds into jealousy. And so what does the person  do where they're in a relationship? They're afraid of losing that relationship because that'll  prove that they're not lovable. That'll expose their shame to everybody. They got to keep the  relationship together. So they use fear. I will make that person afraid of leaving me. I will make  that person afraid of having any other friendships. Even having relationships with their parents,  I will use my anger. I will use abuse. I will threaten them. I will keep them afraid of  ever leaving me. Then I will manipulate them all kinds of different ways to try and get them to  never leave me, to continue to stay with me, even though I'm not meeting their needs, even though  this relationship is not satisfying for them. I will love bomb them. I will guilt them. I will  threaten them. All kinds of different things that we just talked about. The ultimate for many  people, and this one takes time, but it's gaslighting. I will slowly wear them down so that they no  longer trust their own thinking. They no longer trust their own perception. But they now trust  me more and more to think for them. They trust me more and more to perceive reality. So I will do  things early in the relationship to say, no, you're not thinking right. Oh, you didn't see that  correctly. And they will start to doubt themselves. They will start to give me more weight in their  thinking, me more weight in their perception. What I will do is feed shame in a subtle way that  they will get to a point where they don't trust themselves at all. And they trust me totally.  That takes time, but when a person can do that, then the other person probably isn't going to leave.  And so jealousy is this powerful negative force that is basically working for mind control,  basically working to totally control the other person. It almost creates these like a pimple  or cult type of culture within the home over another person. So it's interesting to me as I've worked  over the years with people with huge jealousy issues, is they never admit to themselves how ugly it  is, how damaging it is, how controlling it is, how abusive it is. They always say, but I love  them so much. I just do this because I want the best for them. So they can't admit their own fear.  They can't admit their own shame and the extents that they're willing to go to try to solve their  shame, to try to protect themselves from being abandoned. They just try to spin it as love.  So the issue what I'm hoping you see with jealousy, jealousy tries to make it the other person's fault.  It tries to blame the other person. Oh, you talk to that guy too much. Oh, you dress inappropriately.  Oh, you go out so often. It's always trying to make my feelings your fault. What I hope you're  beginning to see is jealousy is it's my shame. That's the issue. It's not the other person at all. That  other person can change in a thousand different ways. They can do everything that I say they need to  do to change. And I'm still going to be jealous because I haven't dealt with my shame. I haven't  dealt with the belief that I'm not good enough that the person will eventually leave me when they  really see what I'm like. Because there's a lot of better people out there. So you gotta heal  the shame. The next one is a deep longing for validation. So we talked about that shame basically  is always felt less than not good enough. I don't have any inherent value. And so the longing  still is there that I want to be validated. Now, let me just add a piece to this. So just  being in complex trauma where your needs aren't being met is a child begins to feel that they're  they don't have value. They're not something's wrong with them. That's why their needs are not being  met. But many families in complex trauma, they operate it off a belief that the worst thing you  could create in a child is pride where the child thinks they're better than everybody. And so their  solution to that was don't validate your children because you might give them a big head. So never  praise them. Never talk about how great they have done because then your child's going to get a  big head and they're going to become proud. It's a totally wrong understanding of validation.  Validation doesn't lead to pride. Shame actually leads to pride. And so this lack of validation  is what caused a lot of people to have even heightened shame because nobody ever validated them  and a child needs to be validated. Then for others they had workaholic parents. They had angry  abusive parents. They had critical parents. All of those instead of giving validation they got  criticism. Instead of getting validation they got nothing. Nobody was there for them. And so  this growing shame inside of them. But we have a need for validation. It lets us know who we are.  It lets us understand that we are valuable just the way we are that our personality is just okay  the way it is. That our body is okay the way it is. We need validation. And if we're not getting it  if we're in an environment that is non-validating we can develop a hyper drive for validation.  Some children they try to suppress it and push it down. I don't need validation. But others  they go to this hyper longing for validation. And so it can go in two directions. Some are just  very overt with it. They're out there trying to get validation. They try to be the center of  attention. They try to get the spotlight on themself. They brag all the time and point out and tell  everybody how great they are and about all their accomplishments. They lie and embellish stories  and make up stories to try to impress people. They drop hints all the time about things they've  done trying to be a little more subtle but they're just hoping somebody is impressed with them  or somebody says wow you are amazing or they get lots of degrees. Lots of possessions. They show  their greatness through their degrees and possessions to impress people to get people to validate them.  Others are more subtle. They're not in your face but this can go a couple different directions.  So the first is to me a significant one. I've had so many clients that every time they get a new  job every time they accomplish something the first thing that pops into their head is I wonder if  dad will be proud of me. I wonder if mom will say anything. They're not going to go advertise it  but the longing is there that mom and dad will still validate them and communicate that they're  proud of them. They've never gotten that and even at 40-50 they're still hoping for that. That  shows how powerful this is. Others they don't necessarily put it out there that they've accomplished  stuff but they might hint at it a little bit. They might just do little things that they hope draw  attention to something that they've accomplished or some they just do really really nice things for  people and the reason for doing extra nice things for people is that somebody will say thank you.  Somebody will say you're so wonderful. Somebody will validate them. So they're not going to  ask for it. They're just going to do things and hope that somebody validates them and that can drive  them. Once they get a few people, when they do nice things and a few people compliment them and  praise them, now they can just be driven to keep doing nice things constantly because that longing  there's so thirsty for validation. Now I need to add something here. Some children  didn't get validation from their parents. They had workaholic parents. They had angry critical  parents but they long for validation. The first thing they got validated for from a friend,  from a teacher, from a relative, all of a sudden that created this thirst and they began to do  that thing over and over again. So we talked about this in the last video. For some it was being  funny. For some it was being good in a certain sport. For some it was certain hobby. For some it was  their looks. All of a sudden now they focused on that but what we saw is now they're looking for  their value in externals. Now they always have to pursue only that and they begin to pursue it in  unhealthy ways and it actually becomes destructive. There's another thing that I need to add and  that is that some children didn't receive any positive validation but they got negative validation.  They got noticed. They got attention. They got validated when they were bad, when they misbehaved,  when they went against what mom and dad wanted. When mom and dad got angry and gave them attention,  that was a form of validation. And so to the child it was even negative validation is better  than no validation at all. What often happens with that is they then begin to continue to do what  gets them the negative validation. That then attracts a certain peer group. Other kids who are in  the same boat, they know from a group and they respect each other for how bad they are, for how  tough they are, for the trouble that they get in. And so they validate each other now. Then for some  that leads to now they develop an identity that they're the bad kid, that they're the kid that  steals all the time, that lies all the time, that breaks the neighbor's property all the time  and that identity becomes something that's respected. So this can just build in more and more  negative directions. The next characteristic is people with shame become hypersensitive to disrespect.  So if you look at complex trauma and shame it comes out of an environment where you're not treated  with respect, where you're neglected, where you're abused, where you're laughed at, where you're  criticized, where you're abandoned, all of those communicate disrespect, or you even get  you're compared with others. You're made to feel like you're a burden, that you're a failure,  that you're a mistake, all disrespect. So disrespect is part of shame. That's what a shame is,  I now feel disrespect for myself. I now feel that I don't deserve respect. I have to earn respect.  But what is important to understand is that disrespect hurts a lot. Disrespect spits on my value.  It says I'm a zero. It is like pouring salt in a wound. Disrespect is a very, very painful emotion  because it's a statement about my identity that's very negative. So for children growing up  in complex trauma, disrespect can be verbal, but disrespect can also be how people treat me.  They don't see me. They don't hear me. They ignore me. All of those disrespect, disrespect,  disrespect, it is so painful. And so what happens when a child's in an environment where they're  experiencing disrespect every day. That's complex trauma. Is the child begins to do a couple  things. Number one, they believe that everybody looks down on them. Everybody sees them through the  eyes of disrespect. They assume that now. Secondly, that then means when they go into relationships,  they re-disrespect into situations where there's no disrespect at all. So let me give you an example.  I was teaching at a seminar and afterwards people come up and talk to me and ask me questions.  And so there was a line of people waiting to talk to me and there's a person talking to me.  All of a sudden this person came up and they tried to butt in front of the line and they tried  to interrupt the person who was talking to me and they wanted to talk to me now. And I just  very respectfully put up my hands and just serve. You could just give a minute here. I'm talking  to this person and I'll get to you very shortly. That person left in a huff. That person said to  their friend, he just treated me with great disrespect. All I did was set a respectful boundary.  But because of all of the disrespect they had experienced all their life, they now red  disrespect into me setting a respectful boundary. So that is what happens all of the time  with children coming at a complex trauma. But then it does a third thing. Now if I sense disrespect,  there's a powerful, intense reaction to stop it, to fight back. And so if I sensed respect,  it could be true disrespect or it could be disrespect that I read into situations where it's  not even there. Now I am going to lash out. I am going to get angry. I am going to disrespect  the other person. I am going to do all I can to hurt them worse than they're hurting me.  So shame creates this powerful reaction every time that disrespect thing gets triggered.  And wow, that can do a ton of damage in relationships to children, to partners, to friends.  That is the problem with this hypersensitivity to disrespect. You read it in to where it's not  even there and then you overreact and do a ton of damage. That leads to the next one.  Shame also is hypersensitive to criticism. So these are connected. But a child where shame develops  is often been criticized verbally by being made to feel they aren't good enough by not being  seen, by not being heard, by being laughed at, by being teased, all kinds of different things.  Many children grew up in families where it didn't matter how well they did, how hard they tried,  it never was good enough. Their parents always found something to criticize about it. They always  came up short. Now most of us, if I know I have done something wrong that violates love,  I can accept criticism because I know it's designed to help me. But boy, when I am doing my best,  when my heart is pure and I am still being criticized, it hurts like crazy. It feels unjust.  It feels wrong. It feels I can't win. It causes deep pain. It's very discouraging.  And so again, criticism like disrespect hurts a ton. And we develop this powerful reaction.  Every time we sense that it's coming because what criticism is doing is exposing our shame.  It is putting out for all to see how bad we fear we are. And so people, when they sense that  criticism is coming, they can overreact. They can get very angry. They can lash out because  they never want to look bad again. The problem is, is that they redefine what is a criticism.  So, whenever somebody gives them a different opinion, they, they, you're criticizing me.  No, I'm giving you a different opinion. Whenever somebody gives you feedback in a situation,  you're criticizing me. You're trying to make me look stupid. Whenever somebody points out a legitimate  mistake that you've made, you're criticizing me. When somebody is trying to even be helpful in a  situation, you're criticizing me. And so what begins to happen is they go, they develop a belief that  for you to not criticize me means that you must never disagree with me. It means that you must  never call me on my stuff. Even when I am doing stuff that violates love, that's clearly wrong.  In other words, if you're not totally for me and agree with me 100%, then you're against me.  Loyalty means that you will never criticize me. That's how they begin to frame it. That's how  deep their shame is. That they can't look at themselves honestly. They can't have others look  at them honestly. They can't see any of their flaws. They can't get any other opinions or help.  They must be 100% right all the time never challenged. That basically moves people into  narcissistic distorted thinking. And that does so much damage in relationships. The next one  is what happens with shame is image becomes more important than reality. So what shame believes  and concludes is that if people get to know the authentic me, they will never love me and accept  me and respect me. In other words, based on my internal world, which is not good enough, I will never  get love acceptance respect and my needs met. Therefore, the only way to get love respect and get  my needs met is by creating an external world that people respect my image. So all the focus then  goes to creating the perfect outward external world that they think people will respect,  cause them to like them, then cause them to want a relationship with them, then cause them to  meet their needs. So the image, what they present to the external world now becomes all important.  So they have to act perfectly, they have to be impressive in how they look, what they own,  performance, they got to control all of their external world in order to get acceptance.  Then if they have children and many of the clients they work with have experienced this when they  went old in public, they had to be dressed to the nines, they had to behave with all the right manners,  they had to show lots of affection to themselves. But behind closed doors, it was a totally different  story. There was anger that it was it was chaos. But in public, you had to be the perfect family  because that's how you got respect. So the bottom line again is this, people cannot get to know  the real me. We got to keep a big part of our life a secret and only let people see what we want  them to see, what we can control, what makes us look good. Do you realize that that creates  constant insecurity, constant fear that this host of cards that you created just might collapse,  it feeds shame. And if something goes wrong, boy, that could mess up everything. So this whole  image issue is big for many people because the alternative has become authentic and that is  super scary. But that is really what recovery is about is becoming authentic. The next one  is shame results in many insecurities. So shame basically begins to feel the need to hide parts  of yourself that were rejected. So I got to hide my personality. I'm an introvert. I got to hide parts  of my body because I got teased for that. So now what happens if I can't hide some parts of me,  I can't hide my body. I feel insecure all the time about my body. What happens if parts of me that  have been hiding from my personality come out. So I start crying or I get really sad or I get angry  or I show fear. Then I get really insecure because I got punished for those before. I got made fun  of for those before. And then what happens if the things that I turn to to try to make me feel secure,  to try to make me feel important like my body, like my job, like my money, like my possessions. What  happens if something threatens them so I get older and I start losing my looks and I start losing  my body and my figure. Or I come up to retirement and I'm going to lose my job in security, in security,  in security. So shame produces many insecurities. In securities about every aspect of you that has  been criticized, made fun of, that you've rejected and hated about yourself, things that you've built  to try to build security in your life, but are actually things that could be threatened. All of  those cause a person of deeper insecurity. But there's a second piece that comes out of complex  trauma. What is it that causes child to feel security? It's not just having a secure external  environment. It's having a rock to firmly connect to. Mum and dad who are safe, who are reliable,  who are trustworthy. When a child has a rock, they can have an external or that's not totally secure,  but they still feel secure because they're connected to the rock. So what happens if you can't connect,  you feel insecure all the time? Complex trauma produces insecurity at that level as well. Then if  they have a major failure in their life, they work away at something and fail, that creates insecurities.  Then if they're abandoned, that creates deep, deep insecurities. So they can get insecurity from  all kinds of different sources. That comes out of shame and complex trauma. The final one  is they promise more than they can deliver. So shame basically says that people won't love me and  respect me for who I am, just the way I am. The only way they'll respect me is if I seem bigger than  I am. So I need to promise more than I can deliver. So the bigger they can make them  self, the more they think they're going to be liked and accepted. So let's promise the moon to  everybody. Let's promise that, oh yeah, say yes to everybody, I can do this. Let's build ourselves up,  make yourself look really big. They set themselves up to disappoint people because they can't deliver.  They're not superman. And often they end up making all these promises and spending all kinds of  time trying to wiggle out of those promises because they know they can't do it and making excuses  for why they can't do it and still try to save face. So people from complex trauma with deep shame  often end up promising more than they can deliver. So that's shame aspect. I hope it just fills out  your thinking that of how complex trauma has affected you, that you can begin to spot some of  these areas in your life and go, oh yeah, I can see now that that's not healthy, that ultimately  feed shame, hurts relationships, hurts me, I want to change. Okay, that's the end of another week.  Thank you so much again for being here. We'll see you next week. Have a great week.
