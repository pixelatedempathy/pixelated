# Phase 1: Requirements Specification â€“ Cipher Multi-Agent Context Sharing

## 1. Project Background & Goals

Pixelated Empathy requires secure, modular, and testable context sharing between multiple agents (AI and human) using campfirein/cipher. The solution must support both Node.js (TypeScript) and Python agents, integrate with existing memory-bank, and maintain HIPAA++ compliance, auditability, and <50ms context sync latency.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Cipher Installation & Configuration
- Cipher must be installed and configured for both Node.js and Python agents (if supported).
- No hardcoded secrets or environment variables in code/config; use secure vaults or environment management.
- Configuration must be modular, extensible, and documented.

### 2.2 Secure Context Sharing
- Agents can securely share, retrieve, and update context via Cipher.
- All context operations must be authenticated and authorized.
- Context data must be encrypted in transit and at rest.
- Integration must not break existing agent workflows or memory-bank usage.

### 2.3 Validation & Sanitization
- All user inputs and agent messages must be validated and sanitized before sharing.
- Validation logic must be modular and testable.
- Error handling must be comprehensive, with clear error types and audit logging.

### 2.4 Extensibility
- Design must support future agent types (e.g., new AI models, human roles).
- Configuration and context schemas must be easily extendable.

### 2.5 Performance & Compliance
- Context sync latency must be <50ms for all agent operations.
- All context sharing must maintain HIPAA++ compliance and auditability.
- Integration must be compatible with pnpm, uv, and Dockerized environments.

## 3. Edge Cases

- Agent attempts to share context with invalid or missing credentials.
- Context data exceeds allowed size or contains prohibited content.
- Cipher service is unavailable or returns errors.
- Agent type is unsupported or misconfigured.
- Memory-bank integration fails or context is out-of-sync.
- Performance degradation under high load or concurrent agent operations.

## 4. Constraints

- No hardcoded secrets or environment variables in code/config.
- All code and config must be modular and under 500 lines per file.
- Must not break existing agent workflows or memory-bank usage.
- Must be compatible with pnpm, uv, and Dockerized environments.
- All user inputs and agent messages must be validated and sanitized.

## 5. Acceptance Criteria

- Cipher is installed and configured for both Node.js and Python agents (if supported).
- Agents can securely share, retrieve, and update context via Cipher.
- No hardcoded secrets in any code or config.
- All changes are covered by tests and documented.
- Integration does not degrade performance or security.

## 6. TDD Anchors

// TEST: Cipher is installed and loads for Node.js and Python agents
// TEST: Agents can share, retrieve, and update context securely via Cipher
// TEST: No hardcoded secrets or environment variables in code/config
// TEST: All context operations are validated, sanitized, and audited
// TEST: Integration maintains <50ms context sync latency under load
// TEST: Memory-bank integration is not broken by Cipher usage
// TEST: Error handling covers all edge cases (invalid credentials, service errors, etc.)
// TEST: Configuration and context schemas are modular and extensible
// TEST: All changes are covered by unit, integration, and performance tests
// TEST: Solution passes HIPAA++ compliance checks
