Last week we started a new series on boundaries and hopefully it gave you an understanding of what they are.  Today I want to take you a little bit further.

But just to recap, boundaries, we talked about internal boundaries, that's the rules I have for myself.  External boundaries are how close I let people into my life.  Those are there, healthy boundaries are there for the purpose of helping me get healthy and protecting me from different things.  What I want to look at today is how complex trauma greatly affects people's boundaries, understanding how they use boundaries, difficulties in setting healthy boundaries.  So for a person coming out of a fairly healthy home, boundaries they quickly.  Get and they have lived with healthy boundaries.

But for people coming out of complex trauma, there's a whole new level that you need to understand as to how difficult boundaries can be.  And I hope you saw last week that if you do not get healthy boundaries, you do not get healthy but you do not make it in recovery.  So I want you to understand how complex trauma affects boundaries, how it messes people.  And I hope you will be able to follow up when it comes to having boundaries in their life today.  I think the first thing that is important to understand is that complex trauma is all about unhealthy boundaries.  People in complex trauma have lots of boundaries.  They might not be aware that they have those boundaries, but they have them.  They are just not healthy.  So let me give you an idea of how that works.  What we have seen in the past is that for complex trauma families, which are also referred to as dysphagia, or dysfunctional families, the idea is it's families that are in pain.  They create pain, and also they are not able to resolve the pain that's been created.  And so people have to find ways of coping with this unresolved pain.  And that sets up all kinds of coping strategies that seem to work, that take away the pain, but actually are making things worse.  So those strategies of dealing with unresolved pain are actually the ones that are most important.  And they are actually rules or boundaries that they live by.  So for example, boundary number one, or rule number one, is if the authority figure of the home is the one causing the pain and not resolving it, then to lessen pain or not have as much pain, do whatever the authority wants.  Never challenge them.  Never annoy them.  Let them have their way.  And that will take away some pain.  The point is it takes it away in the immediate circumstances, but it does not resolve it.  It just piles it up for later in life.  A second rule is never show emotions that the authority figure finds annoying.  Because if you show those emotions, then they are going to get mad at you and punish you, and that will increase your pain.

Third, do not talk about your problems.  Do not talk about your needs.  Do not talk about what's wrong with the family.  And the issues that the family needs to face.  Because if you do, you are going to get punished and hurt.  So that's just three very simple basic boundaries that exist within a complex trauma family.  So they seem to work, but something's happening that is very harmful.  First of all, the needs of the people in the family are not being met.  And because of all of this unresolved pain and how it's being dealt with, there's things happening inside of the child and the people in the family that are creating greater and greater negative emotions.  They have more shame, more guilt, more anger, even depression and anxiety.  It's building inside.  And so all of that, they do not have a solution for.  It's unresolved.  And so you get this growing, accumulating amount of pain that is happening.  And that's why we are talking about the trauma family.  And I think that's a very important point that we should all be thinking about.  Because trauma families are not just about the emotional pain that's happening in each family member.  And it will come out later in life and not in a good way.  So let me give you some general approaches that complex trauma families take to boundaries.  And some of you will relate to one extreme or another or a blend of them.  You can have no rules.  Just do whatever you want.  Just do not bug me.  Or you have rules that are very unreasonable.  Rules that are rigid.  There's no bend.  There's no compromise.  It's my way or the highway.  And then when it comes to enforcing rules, you can have very strict enforcement of rules or very lenient or very inconsistent.  Sometimes the rules are enforced.  Sometimes the consequences are enforced.  Sometimes they are not.  It really depends on the mood of the authority figure on that day.  And so that inconsistency is there.

But more than that, you can have mom enforce rules one way and dad enforce them another way so that children learn how to play mom and dad.

But there's an inconsistency there in the two authority figures and how they enforce the rules.

The next thing is children begin to realize these rules that dad or mom are enforcing or making, they are not really about what's best for me.  It's about what makes their life easier, what's best for them.  So dad does not want people talking at all over supper because he wants to watch the news.  And so it's silence, silence.  Dad does not want anybody playing in the house because it's too much noise.  And you realize, okay, rules are not about what my benefit is.  It's all about them.  And that creates a lot of pain.

But more than that, the child begins to think, rules are there to restrict my fun.  Rules are there to make life less enjoyable.  Rules are not about what's best for me.

Therefore, happiness is found in breaking rules, in stepping outside.  In stepping outside of what the restrictions are.  And so many of you can relate.  If you see a sign today that says, wet cement, do not touch, a big part of you just says, I want to touch the cement.  And that comes out of the complex trauma.  There's the allure of the forbidden.  Anything forbidden, you go, I think that would give me a lot of pleasure.  And that comes out of rules being not for your benefit in the past, but only for the authority figure's benefit.  Next thing is, you are going to begin to realize, there's two sets of rules in the house.  There's a double standard.  There's a set of rules for the kids, or some of the kids.  And then dad has a different set of rules, or mom has a different set of rules, or one child gets away with more stuff, and there's a different set of rules for them.  And so you begin to live with rules that are different for everybody.  And that can cause a lot of pain, but a lot of anger as well.  Next one, how the rules were enforced.  So violation of rules or violation of boundaries needs to have built in consequences.  That's the design.  So that when a child steps into telling a lie or in doing stuff that's hurtful to others, there needs to be a consequence.  So they learn quickly that that behavior is not healthy and it will ruin you and your relationship.  And that's the design.  So that's the design.  So that's the design.  And that's the design.  So that's the design.  So that's the design.  So that's the design.  If you do not change that.  So the pain of the consequences is to be appropriate to the crime, and then it's to motivate the child to live a healthy life.  So it's to be fair.  It's to be what's best for the child.  It's always around a moral issue that is violated, that there's a negative consequence.  Within complex trauma families, it's not always like that.  In fact, it's seldom like that in some families.  So what they find, is fear is the way to motivate the children to live inside mom and dad's rules, what mom and dad want.  So if a child comes home and they have been drinking for the first time, mom and dad might use fear, and instead of saying, you are playing with fire or what's going on with you, is this just an innocent experimental thing, and explore it, they go, you are going to end up an addict.  I am going to take you downtown and I am going to let you see people living on the street.  As a ruby, so that you see where you are headed.  And it's over the top, an exaggerated horror show, trying to scare them straight.  The problem with that, is it might work for a little while, but over time, the children begin to realize that this is just an exaggerated horror show, and it actually begins to turn them off.

The next thing that some families do, to try and motivate their children to live by the rules, is if they step outside of the rules, they get shamed, they get put down, they get made fun of, they get called names, they get told they are a failure, a loser, they will never amount to anything.  And parents hope that the pain of the shame will make them want to change their behavior.  Initially, that might work.

But over time, if they continue to get shamed, even when they are trying to change, they will eventually not do it anymore.  It will no longer work.  It will not work for them.  Some parents, when a child does something wrong in their mind, they subject the child to a long rant.  And they can go on for 15 minutes, 20 minutes, a half hour, an hour, preaching a sermon to the child on why they should not do what they are doing, how it's making the family look bad, and all kinds of different things that the child is subjected to.  It's really not about what's best for the child.  It's about the parent venting their behavior, badgering the child, trying to manipulate them to change.

But the child begins to tune them out.  And after a while, as soon as mom or dad start their rant, their eyes glaze over, and it just hardens their heart even more.  It creates a rebellion and a defiance that goes deeper and deeper each time.  Some families, the punishment does not fit the crime.  So a kid is five minutes late on a curfew for the very first time and they get grounded for a month.  Or, the punishment goes on and on and on.  So the design of a healthy consequence is a punishment that is designed to be fair and bring the child back in, and once it's resolved, everything is restored.  In complex trauma and unhealthy families, the parent might want to punish you until the parent feels you have learned your lesson.  So they might give you the silent treatment.  They might withhold love from you because in their mind, you deserve it.  And they are going to make you stay in that doghouse for quite a while.  And it does not fit the crime.  It does not.  It is not concerned with what's best for the child.  So those are some of the things that complex trauma families do.  Another characteristic of the child and the other characteristic of complex trauma families when it comes to boundaries is, is a lot of boundaries are set when the parent is angry.  So they are reactive rules.  So a child or the family has a great big fight and there's all kinds of fighting amongst the siblings, etc.  And so dad is angry and he might say, okay, from now on, we are going to have supper together every night.  In his mind, the reason the family's fighting is because they are not eating supper together.  And so now the rule, everybody has to be here every night.  Or a child is late, like I just said, and they get grounded for a month.  Again, what I have seen over the years with that kind of reactive rule setting or boundary setting is it might be enforced for a week or so, but then it just gradually drifts back to the way it was.  It was not a thought-out boundary.  It was something that was carefully weighed out as to whether it was fair, whether they could continue to enforce it over time.  It was just a reaction.  And what can happen with children who have lots of that kind of stuff is after a while, when a reactive boundary is set, they go, oh well, in a couple weeks they will just be back, so it's not a big deal.  And it means nothing to them.

Another thing that can happen is no does not mean no.  Saying no to somebody is setting a boundary.

But what can happen in a complex trauma family is a child can put a sign on their door and saying, this is my room, please keep out.  This is my journal, my diary, please do not read it.  And to the parents, they do not respect that.  They just barge in whenever they want.  They never ask permission.  They step over the child's no.  So a no does not mean no.  And that for many people, can really do a lot of damage.  Because the child realizes that they are not respected, and they realize that they are never allowed to set boundaries with their parents.  And if they try to set a boundary with a parent, they are made to feel guilty that they have done something wrong.  So the unspoken rule of those families is you can set boundaries with everybody else, but never with your parents.  So that does a lot of damage.  So let me give you another example where I kind of take your past and put it into your parenting today.  It is very important for parents today when you say no to a child and you set a boundary, that you mean it.  So if you say to a child that you have to put your shoes in the closet, and to you that's important, or you have to treat your sister better and you have to do this, or you have to treat her better, and you cannot be punching her all the time, and that to you is a very important moral thing, which it should be, and you say no more, and if you do it, here's the consequence.  So now the thing is, what will happen the next time the child does that?  Will your no mean no?  What I have seen happen in many families is the parents would say to a kid wrestling with his sister and punching her and she's crying, and he would say, I told you not to do it, and the child keeps doing it.  And then they raise their voice.  I said, do not do it.  The child keeps doing it.  And then they say, I am going to count to 10, and the child keeps doing it, and the child does not stop at 1 or 2 or 3.  They know that when mom or dad gets to 9, they are going to go 9 and a quarter, 9 and a half, 9 and 3 quarters, and then the child stops.  So what you are training your child to do in those instances is that your no does not mean no.  And they figure out when you finally mean no.  And that sets up some very unhealthy dynamics that could cause a lot of danger in that child's life if they were in a big thing, in a big dangerous situation, and you said, no, do not do that, and your no did not mean no to them, they could go ahead and do it and get hurt badly.  So learning or training your children that no means no, or first time obedience, is a very important thing, but make sure the boundaries are fair, make sure the consequences are reasonable, and make sure you are prepared to enforce it.  What can happen in some families if a child refuses to live by certain boundaries that they know are not fair, that they know are a double standard, is that the parents then will do everything in their power, to coerce that child to follow the rules of the family, even though the rules might be bad.  They will use shame, they will use guilt trips, they will punish them, they will make the child the problem child.  Whereas the child might actually be trying to be healthy, they are made to feel like the scapegoat.  And so those pressures are brought against the child to try to force them to change.  The parents are the ones who will make the child the problem child.  Parents might even recruit other relatives and friends to go and talk to the child because of that.

Another thing is children become afraid to say no.  So if they say no and then it's stepped over, or they get punished, or they are always put down, they might become a people pleaser.  And they are afraid that everybody will reject them and so they say yes to everybody because they do not want anybody mad at them and they are afraid if they set a boundary people will be mad at them.  And that sets them up to let other people use them, take advantage of them, because they are afraid to say no.  And then for many children who are not allowed to set boundaries, the only way they can get some space or create a boundary is through anger or isolation.  So they just move away from everybody and hide out in their room or they explode and scare everybody off.  Those are the only tools they have to try to create a safe bubble for themselves.

Another thing that can happen is that children in complex trauma often the only way they can set a boundary outside of anger and isolation is if they try to set a boundary they have to close their heart.  They have to be mad at that person, they have to hate that person, they have to want nothing to do with that person.  So the only way they have the strength to enforce a boundary is to close their heart to a person.  As soon as they open their heart a bit then they let everybody do whatever they want again and so they find that as their only solution.  Then they have another issue that comes up.  And so what I am hoping you are seeing is there's lots of issues that come out of complex trauma around this boundary thing that makes it very, very difficult for people to get healthy today.

But what happens when you get into a relationship?  A lot of people coming out of complex trauma what they have found in their families is that everybody's into everybody's business so they are very enmeshed or everybody's totally isolated.  Nobody talks to each other.  And so part, if you have been in enmeshed relationships within your family and now as an adult you get into a relationship with somebody the fear can be if I let you into my life now I am responsible to make you happy all the time.  I am responsible for your emotions.
