To see that I am selfish.  And you become a pro at twisting your brain to believe distortions are the truth.  So now when a gaslighter starts distorting reality, you are great at agreeing with them.  Because you have done it all your life.  And you are very prone to that.  Next, conflict avoidance.  You do not want conflict.  Conflict scares you.  You are afraid of angry people.  So when they get upset with you and say, you are going crazy, this did not really happen, you do not want to get in an argument.  Because in your childhood, arguments never got resolved positively.  They always resulted in the person in authority winning and everybody else getting hurt.  And so you just give in.  Yes, you are right, you are right.  Just to avoid conflict.  And away you go.  And then you got that good old limbic brain.  Complex trauma, you define reality, not by facts, but how you are feeling.  So your cortex that learns to piece together the facts of life and make decisions based on facts and evidence, not on feelings, has never been developed.  That part of your brain has not been developed.  Well, so guess what people who gaslight are great at doing?  Triggering your limbic brain so that you define reality by what you are feeling at that moment.  And they are good at making you feel certain things.  And then you believe what they are saying, the distortions.  So complex trauma in many different ways sets people up to fall prey to gaslighters.  So let me end with this.  What happens if you are in a relationship like this?  I do hope that you can see that the longer you stay in it, the more damage it's going to do to you.  And if you have kids, they will also be damaged by that.  I hope that you can reach out for help and get out of that kind of relationship before it takes the great toll that it takes.  If you have been through it, do not beat yourself up.  Do not go, how could I have been so stupid?  I am so dumb.  And just get down on yourself.  Say, okay, that happened.  Let's start learning from it.  I have to work on my shame issues.  I have to work on all of those other issues that I talked about.  And begin to really turn this into a growing relationship and a growing opportunity.  And I think if you do that, over the years, you will find your distorted world gets more and more clear and accurate.  And you start getting your self-worth back.  And you start getting confidence back.  And you are almost at a place where you are thankful, not that you had to go through it, but for the lessons you learned.  I should add just very briefly what I just said about gaslighting.  People who become gaslighters, you realize they have just as much complex trauma as the people they gaslight.  So gaslighting type people come, in my opinion, from my years in this field, come from the more severe end of the complex trauma spectrum.  And they have deep, deep shame issues.  So their way of trying to solve their shame is to be better than everybody.

But then even greater than that, in the even more severe cases, they are not going to be happy until they have made somebody a zero.  And that's how they try to solve their shame.  So they have the exact same shame issues, trauma issues, as the people that they are gaslighting.  So they, at some point, have to come and face their own stuff if they ever want to get better.  It's possible for them to do that, but it is not easy.  So let's move to the Christian part.  Last week, we talked about one of those very basic questions as people begin a relationship with God, which is, how do I know what God wants me to do?  How do I know where to go to school?  How do I know what job to take, who to marry, all of those kind of questions.  So we looked at how does God, guide us or show us what we should do in our life?  And I told you at the end that today I would give you an illustration of somebody that went through the very things that we talked about as to how God guides us.  So it's Paul, who is known as the Apostle Paul.  He was the guy that, if you are not familiar with the story, is when Jesus died and went back to heaven, he then sent the disciples out to start spreading the message.  And Paul was a leader in the Jewish religion at that time, and he hated this new group of people who followed Jesus.  Because in his mind, they were corrupting and misunderstanding Judaism.  So he went on a personal vendetta mission of wiping out these followers of Jesus.  And one day, as he is heading to Damascus, Syria, to capture Christians and to put them in jail, and hopefully, in his mind, some would be killed, he is stopped on the middle of the road by this shining light out of heaven.  And there's a voice that says out of heaven, Paul, Paul, why are you persecuting me?  Now in Paul's mind, he was persecuting Jesus, but now it sounds like Jesus is God.  Because God is God.  Because God's voice saying, why are you persecuting me?  So that became Paul's conversion moment where he was overwhelmed with the reality that Jesus is the true Messiah, and he followed him and entered a relationship with him.  So once he did that, God said to him, here's my plan for you.  I want you to become the main preacher to non-Jewish people.  So up until that point, the followers of Jesus were basically in Israel and were Jewish people.  Now God is saying, Paul, I want you to take the message out into the world of non-Jews.  So that would be our world today.  So Paul has this clear guidance from God that he got in this special revelation from God, but then God let him use his own brain.  So he says, what would make sense as to how to begin to reach the Gentile or the non-Jewish world?  So in his mind he goes, I actually grew up in Gentile country.  Let's start around my hometown.  And then let's work out from there and go to other cities where non-Jews live and begin to reach out.  So that was his first missionary journey.  And he went to a group of cities that were close to him.  And he went to a group of cities that were close to where he had grown up and told them about Jesus.  A number of people began to follow Jesus, but after a while he came back to Israel and he reported what was happening.  And then he decided, I need to go on a second journey.  So again, how did God reveal his will?  Nothing.  Except Paul, use your head.  Think through what makes sense, what is logical.  So Paul said, well, I am going to go back to the cities that I have already visited, that there's new little groups of followers of Jesus, and I am going to check up on them, spend time with them, teach them.  And then I will just keep going a little bit further west.  So he went through the places he had already been and he started to go west, but we are told that, and we do not know how, but something stopped him or prevented him from going further west.  He said, oh, okay, so that door's closed.  I thought that was where I should go.  God closed that door.  Okay, south is the Mediterranean Sea.  I cannot go there.  So let's try going north because east is back to Israel.  So it makes sense to go north.  So he goes up north and we are told that door got closed too.  So now he goes, okay, God, you called me and told me I am supposed to reach the Gentile world.  I am going to the only two logical places further west and north and both doors have been closed.  Now what am I supposed to do?  And God did not immediately send an answer.  He let Paul sit in this confused place for two to four weeks.  Now most of us know how we do not like sitting in the unknown.  Well, Paul had to sit there for a while.  And so he just accepted, okay, God, until you make clear what you want.  And so he said, I do not know what to do.  I guess I am here and I will wait.  And we hate waiting.

But here's what I want you to see.  God's will is not always clear.  So we are trying different things and doors are closing and we come to times of confusion as to, God, I do not even know for sure what you want me to do.  I think you want me to do something, but I do not know what it is and I am so confused.  And then God just lets us sit there for a while.  Now here's what a lot of people like.  They say, God, I want you to show me what to do next.

But what they really mean is, God, show me what you want the next ten steps to be.  So I have it all planned out.  And God says, take the next step and then wait for direction from there.  And we do not like that.  You know there's a verse in the Bible that says, God's word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path.  And I have read, and I do not know for sure if it's true, but I have read that one of the things that a person would do in that culture when you had lamps, that you would strap it to your leg.  And so what the verse is saying is, as you took one step, you got enough light from your leg for the next step.

But you did not get enough light for ten steps down.  You just got enough light for the next step.  So God's word is a light to my feet one step at a time.  And that's what Paul was experiencing.  God made the first step clear.  Paul took it.  Then he had to wait until God made the next step clear.  So after two to four weeks, one day Paul has a vision.  And it's a man, who would be in modern day Greece, which is on the other side of the Aegean Sea.  And he says, Paul, please come here.  And so Paul says, I think God's trying to tell me where to go next.  So he gets on a ship, goes across the sea to Greece, and then he starts there.  And so what then happens while he's there is also very instructive for us, because Paul's normal plan and his practice when he went to a Gentile city was that there usually would be a small group of Jewish people who had left Israel and gone for business or whatever.  He would find a little synagogue where they met and go and meet with them and tell them about the Jewish Jesus.  Sometimes they got mad and kicked them out, but he always would start there.  Okay?  Paul gets to Philippi, the city that he first goes to in modern Greece.  And there's no synagogues anywhere.  So he goes, Now what do I do?  My normal practice is all messed up.  There's nobody to meet with.  So what he realized is that often religious or spiritually based people would have places to get together that were quiet, where they could pray and connect with their higher power.  And they would do it outside of the city, often in nature by a river or something like that.  So Paul checked around and found out that there was a group of people that went outside of the city to a quiet place to pray.  So he says, I am going to go there.  Now what he found is they were all women.  So he's going, This is going to be one hard city to crack.  There's not even one man that's spiritually inclined.  There's no Jews there that would meet.  There's a small group of women that meet in this quiet place.  Now why that's significant is this.  In that world, it was a man's world.  Men had the jobs.  Women did not.  And so what influence could a small group of women have to reach a city?  So to the average person, they have zero impact on a city.  You have to reach men if you want to make a difference.

But Paul has only women.  So he starts out, he starts meeting with these women, getting to know them, talking to them about Jesus, learning about them, and it becomes a daily thing.

But then, one day, this young girl shows up.  And what we are told is that she had a spirit that made her a fortune teller.  So from putting it together with the words that are used, it was like a demon or a spirit presence that would come on her in an involuntary way.  And all of a sudden, she would start prophesying this information about what was going to happen.  And so she starts showing up.  And when she does, she starts saying, these are men from God and they represent the true God.  And Paul begins to go, here's a person who follows Satan advertising God.  I am having a problem with that.  Because if they start listening to her too much, she's actually got their attention by talking about God, but she's going to pull them to following Satan.  I do not want that.  So one day he says to the girl, demon, come on out of her.  In the name of Jesus, get out.  And the demon leaves her.  And the woman loses her ability as a fortune teller.  Now what is significant is this.  This young girl had a couple men who were pimping her out, we would say.  They were making money.  They owned her.  She was being humanly trafficked.  She was owned by them.  She was forced to do what she did.  And they were getting people to pay money to get her to tell their fortune.  And they were getting very wealthy from this young girl.  And so as soon as Paul drives out this spirit, and she can no longer predict the future, they just lost a booming business which was making them very wealthy.  And they are not healthy.

But what has happened is because of their growing wealth, they were gaining greater power in Philippi.  They were being, rubbing shoulders with politicians and big, powerful people.  They were well known and they were gaining power.  So what happened is these men who were pimping out this girl went to the leaders, the political figures of Philippi and they said these two guys, and it was Paul and the partner that he had taken with him, Silas, these two guys, they are messing up this city.  They want to come in and ruin this city.  So they painted a picture that Paul and Silas were insurrectionists.  They were troublemakers.  And if they were allowed to stay around, they were going to cause a whole lot of trouble in Philippi.  Full of lies, total distortions.  They were just mad that they lost their business.

But they slandered and maligned Paul and Silas.  And as a result, the political leaders said, arrest them.  So now, once they are arrested, they did not give them a fair trial.  They listened to these men testify.  Public opinion started to build against Paul and Silas.  They were flogged.  And in a Roman culture, you got the lash on your back.  And then what they did, so you can imagine, you could get up to 40 lashes.  Okay?  And these were lashes that were done with chips of bone on the end of what they called a cat-o-nine-tails.  And it would cut into your skin, right down to the bone.  And then after that, they put them in stocks.  So have you seen westerns where people in stocks, your hands and feet are in stocks, in a fixed position, and you are put out in public where people spit at you, throw stuff at you?

But what is happening with that, and I have read accounts, if you are in this position where you cannot move, do you realize what's happening as the blood and all the wounds are starting to congeal?  And the pain?

But then your muscles start cramping.  Because you are dehydrated and you are in a stuck position, and you cannot do anything.  You cannot do anything to relieve the pain.  So you are in a world of pain.  And then after that, they threw them in a dungeon.  And what that meant was the innermost part of the prison, the high security area, the deepest, darkest part of the prison.  It was not like prison today.  You did not get your meals and you did not get a workout area.  This was cruel.  This was dark.  And so can you imagine Paul sitting there saying, God, I thought you led me here.  How can this be your will?  I thought if we follow your will, you bless us.  This is not a blessing.  If you think it's a blessing, we got a problem.  So Paul is really potentially confused and struggling.  So principle two, God's, following God's will does not mean all your circumstances are going to turn out beautifully.  Following God's will, sometimes God will lead you to a hard place.  And you will go, why or how could God do this?

But that is a reality.  And I am going to show you why God led him to a hard place in just a minute.  Second thing I want you to see, in our Western culture, when we think of making plans, our plans often, our thinking is what is best for me is what makes me more comfortable.  And makes my life better.  God is not concerned about my comfort.  He's concerned about reaching other people.  And so that, we have to reprogram ourself and begin to realize, if I make my comfort the highest priority, I am actually going to sometimes be in opposition to what God wants for my life.  And so I am not going to be open to parts of God's will if my comfort is all that matters.  And so Paul had to learn that.  So why did Paul get led by God to Philippi to end up in a jail?  Well, you have got to understand the story of the jail keeper, the prison keeper.  All we know is this.  He was a man, and guys that managed jails were once soldiers in the Roman army, and this was how they retired.  This was the beginning of the retire.  When you are too old to fight in battles, you went and managed a prison.  So you are this hardened soldier, okay?

But what we know is that this prison master was starting to question life.  He was starting to question all the stuff he had always believed in his culture.  And go, I am not sure I believe that anymore.  So here's God saying, I got a guy that's asking the right questions.  How do I get the guy with the answers to him?  Huh.  Well, Paul does not normally rub shoulders with military people.  He does not normally rub shoulders with ex-soldiers who are in charge of prison.  That's not his social circle.  So God says, Paul's the guy that needs to get with this guy.  How am I going to do it?  Well, now you are starting to see.  Well, we will get him out here, and there will be a girl who's a fortune teller.  Paul will get fed up.  That will get him in a big load of trouble.  And, oh, he will end up in prison.  Oh, but he has not met the prison master yet.  Because the prison master did not come every day and talk to each person in jail and say, how are you doing?  Can I be your friend?  They just did not do that kind of thing.  How is he going to get the prison master to actually come and talk to Paul?  That's the next part of the story.  So Paul's in jail with Silas.  We are told that it's midnight.  They are in a world of pain.  And we are told that they start singing.

Now, you would be singing the blues.  We do not know what Paul's saying, but the point is this.  Paul is saying, God, I do not understand what you are doing here in my life.  I do not understand why you have led me here.

But I choose to trust you.  And how I will show that I am trusting you is I am going to sing thanks to you.  I am going to praise you through song.  So he's singing along, trusting God.  And then this earthquake hits out of the blue.  The earthquake is so severe that it starts popping all the doors of the prison cells open.  There's so much movement happening.  Basically, all the prisoners could go free.

Now, here's where it gets really fascinating.  In that world, the prison master was in charge of the prisoners.  And if a prisoner escaped, the prison master had to take the penalty that that prisoner had.  So if that prisoner was waiting to be put to death, the prison master would be put to death.  That's the way they did it.  So the prison master, that was pretty good job motivation.  To do a good job and make sure nobody escaped.

But now all the prison doors are open.  Paul's included.

Now, you think Paul would be up there saying, Okay, boys, I will lead the way.  Let's get out of here.  You want to know what Paul did?  And as far as you know, Paul was a short little bald guy who was a bit hunched over and bowlegged.  This little guy is saying, Nobody leave.  And he took charge of all the prisoners.  I do not know how they ever sat there and said, Yes, sir.  Yes, sir.  To him.

But they did.  And so the prison master comes down rushing from his house down into the prison, expecting to have all the prisoners gone.  And so as soon as he gets in the prison and he sees the doors open and he does not see Paul with the prisoners, he goes, It's all over for me.  He gets his sword out and he's ready to kill himself.  He says, Let's just get it done with.  And Paul catches him and says, Stop.  Nobody is in the prison.  Nobody has escaped.  And the prison keeper goes, What kind of man is this?  Who does this?  And he goes, There's something about this guy I need to know about.  And he comes and he falls at Paul's feet.  And he says, Please show me how to be right with God.  And Paul has got the perfect opportunity.  So follow the leading.  Let God shut doors.  Realize that he might lead you to a darker place or a hard place.  Trust him in that.  Allow him to work circumstances so that eventually it all starts to make sense.  And you know that that prison guy became the first man follower of Jesus in Philippi.  And then from that, he got his family listening to Paul, his friends.  None of that would happen unless Paul was there.  None of that would happen unless Paul ended up in prison and God made sure an earthquake happened.  So Paul was not there long in advance saying, I know exactly what's going to happen over the next two months.  He just knew the next step.  And often it got real confusing.

But he kept trusting.  He kept following.  And God brought it all together eventually.  So you are not going to know the results of God's guidance right away.  It may be years.  Until you look back and go, Wow.  I see it now.  I could not see it then.  So let me just give you another illustration to end this up.  It's a common story that's been told of a beautiful Persian rug.  So as you looked at it, there was these intricate designs that were all blended together.  And it was absolutely breathtaking.  And a boy was sitting there with his dad looking at it one day.  And he said, Dad, this is stunning.  And Dad says, Let me show you something.  He turned the carpet over to the other side.  And you know what he saw?  All these disjointed threads.  There was no pattern.  There was knots.  There was endings here.  It just looked chaotic.  And he says, Often in life, you just see the chaos part.  And it's not until later you can flip it over and see the beauty of the design that was being created.  That was being created by the chaos.

But you have got to trust there's a master designer who's working out all of this plan in your life.
