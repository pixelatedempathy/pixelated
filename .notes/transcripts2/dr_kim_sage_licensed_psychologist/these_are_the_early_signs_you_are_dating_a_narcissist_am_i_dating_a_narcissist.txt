if you're dating a narcissist or you think you might be dating a narcissist this is the video for you I'm gonna go through what it looks in the beginning when everything seems fabulous and fine and great before hopefully you wake up one day kids in tow running for your life trying to get the out of the situation and yet being trapped because the truth is being with a narcissist and leaving one can often be the hardest thing you ever do at least one of them I'm hoping to spare some of you who might not recognize the signs and at the end of this video I hope you will have a greater understanding of what to look out for and more importantly consider how the hell you're going to get out now before it gets any worse if you've already experienced this and you're too far down the road I hope you will watch this video and feel free to add anything else you think I forgot but this video is really about recognizing the early signs of a narcissist before it gets far deep in and yet at the same time we know we get attached and it's hard to leave before I get started my name is Dr Kim Sage I'm a licensed clinical psychologist and I hope you will consider subscribing hitting the bell and joining this little community that's growing I am grateful to be a part of it with you guys and thankful you're starting to post and share your stories because as I keep saying it really helps us all know that it's not just us and we don't have to be long before I go through this list I want to say a couple of things one is that the odds are extremely high that you're going to get out of this situation and that's extremely high especially if you think you are a narcissist magnet or somehow you found yourself in multiple narcissistic relationships and or even if it's a pretty big one a marriage the chances are you come from a childhood where you were a caretaker where you had parents who had poor boundaries and or parents who were not emotionally available to you or you weren't physically mentally or emotionally safe and you have become really good at meeting other people's needs and facts good that you're the perfect target for a narcissist also if this is true for you might be an empath you might be a person who is in addition to your fabulous caretaking is a warm loving kind human being and that has set you up all the last thing I want to say is that it is true from the Maya Angelou quote that people show you who they are you just have to learn to believe that them and never is that more true than for recognizing the signs of a narcissist all let's get started the first sign is really about you at your core there's a very good chance you have not good enough syndrome now I say this all the time that we all have worthiness issues but some of us have more than others and this is also very true that if you are someone who deep inside your own sense of self doesn't feel good enough you're going to be deeply attracted to the narcissist in the beginning who is going to sort of a mind reader magnetize every part of you that needs to be drawn in he is going or she is going to be able to do that because of their tendency to be charming and love bombing and good at reading you will never feel seen never understood never cared for as you might in the beginning with a narcissist you also want to begin to notice as we go through these things how you feel with them do you feel overly cared for overly seen you never have before as a result of this pay attention to what it brings up in you not just focusing on how great they are the second thing I would say that's important is to look at their social media look at their online presence how do they present themselves on their website in their business with friends on Instagram whatever it is on TikTok nowadays what is it that they seem to be most comfortable talking about is it themselves is it their success and how much are they able to make it about other people in terms of what they post and what they share often because people who are narcissistic have avoidant attachment childhoods they often see dating as a game and because of their lack of being able to expose their true vulnerability they will lean in and lean out and that can be very avoidant as many of them have these types of who overly focused on achievement who weren't very good at meeting emotional needs but who were very good at meeting external needs and when you try to get you close to them and that triggers their vulnerability and their low sense of self that they don't want you to see they might pull back a little bit it kind of feels gamey in that regard and depending on your attachment style this could actually make you chase after them more because with your own needing to feel valued when they pull back you're gonna lean in and do even more for them you can feel even more seen more valuable more needed the next one is they often brag and in the beginning it can be about their car or their job they're really good at boasting and bragging and it may not be over the top and it may but just be aware of someone who is no problem talking about their accomplishments their things their achievements things that now if they're more covert narcissists they may have this element of nobody really gets me you get me and oh my god are you gonna love to hear that especially if you come to me and say oh my god I'm excited to meet you and I'm gonna love to hear that and I'm gonna love to hear that and I'm gonna love to come from a certain childhood where you didn't feel heard or understood either and it feels incredible for you both to be valued and both to be seen and that in and of itself can be a great thing but when you add it to all these other issues it often points to narcissism as opposed to deep romantic love or connection in a healthy way they're often successful narcissists often do they're often climb the ladder quickly they're often at the top looking down as they love to on everyone else and this can be something that you might want to pay attention to and you're not going to be pay attention to and you're not going to be attention to it especially if you are wanting to be with somebody who can take care of you not just emotionally but financially this feels oh this person is got it going on I can be an equal in that or I can be the partner and support that and just pay attention to that sign next one is they often will describe all their exes as crazy and if you watch my videos or me that I think it's really unfair we often call women crazy but not men and if all their exes are crazy that bitch was crazy my ex-wife is crazy no it doesn't work that if you're a man you're a woman you're a woman you're a man you're a man that if you're choosing all crazy people then there's something crazy going on with you now it may just be that we're broken and wounded but don't let them tell you that they're fine and great it's just all their exes that are messed up that's definitely a red flag you often have few friends if they do they're more worshippers or followers very rare true deep connections with other people because that would require reciprocity and they have a difficult time with that they often have poor boundaries whether this is showing up at your place and announce which seems a romantic comedy in the beginning but it's not because you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man or they are just pursuing you way too much too soon and love bombing you and that feels much attention but it's also disrespecting at times what's really going on with you what you need what you want and how you really feel poor boundaries they're often envious of others and jealous even of you but in the beginning they often mask this and it can seem I just really care about you or the flip side to that is often I'm not jealous why would I be jealous there's no one as good as I am which is in the beginning it doesn't come off that you're a woman you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man you're a man it comes off really boastful and confident and if you are someone who struggles with your own self-esteem that can be really magnetic wow this person is really confident they're not worried the next one is if they make you question yourself and you feel a little crazy the way you remember things the way you think about how something happened they're good at gaslighting and flipping the situation and in the beginning they're not going to be as overt about it I mean some might those are more obvious but these are more this collection of signs where you just start to go scratching your head I don't really remember it that way but and it starts to feel that way pretty often that can be concerning as I said before if you come from a caretaker background your own childhood certainly if you had narcissists in your own family or borderlines any of those sort of PDS where there is a general lack of boundary respect there's a general just way of being in the world that is sort of toxic but yet feels normal because you're used to that toxicity you may not recognize that it's not healthy the next one is of course they're not great at feedback or criticism and yet in the beginning you might not really engage in that you might watch how they receive it from other people how do they engage with others this is a huge sign how do they treat people that they perceive as below them whether it's waiters or administrators or there goes maple or assistants or gardeners they have this hierarchy in their mind of who's at the top and it really is important to watch how they treat other people it's not a cliche and you will see them oftentimes act out their narcissistic rage and other people which seems justified oh she's tired he was tired or they went through a hard time but pay attention how they treat other people and when they navigate that anger with other people they've been you will see that tantruming which oftentimes I said in the beginnings kind of seems justified but eventually the tantrum will be to you and as a result of you and directed at you obviously they can be mean to others but the same time they're not going to show this one necessarily allow and that kind of goes with how they treat other people that sort of lack of care for others they can be entitled and powerful and as I said before they often are successful and that is a way that you think it makes sense they're at the top they can't kiss everyone's ass and you have respect but it's this sort of way of disregarding others and you will see them do that if you pay attention they love to talk about themselves and they can often be really good storytellers they're used to captivating an audience I find they're often attractive people who were born genetically attractive and I always say that it goes back to the playground if you get reinforced for let's say your look you're the cute little boy and all the girls are chasing you and you start to lead with that oftentimes narcissists will wield whatever genetic gifts or talents they've been given whether it's their success or power looks or money and because those things in and of themselves often bring followers they learn to really cultivate that sense of themselves even more these are those people who are posing you and seem fabulous and get lots of attention and then they know how to use that to work a room and as a result of that they can be very captivating. And the last one is they can be condescending and a little passive-aggressive in the beginning. Now eventually it can become much more direct but in the beginning it's little pokes here, little jokes there, little sarcasm there, oh you're cute when you're chubby or whatever it is, something along those lines. And they can be very conditional in terms of what they expect because you are a reflection of them. They want to have the most beautiful women, the most beautiful men, the most successful people, those in the best shape. Everyone is a reflection of them including you and you have to understand that there's a condition to that and that your value is only based on what you can give them, what you represent for them, or what you reflect for them. Not necessarily what you feel from them and what they feel from you. It's all about the outside and making them feel more powerful, more successful, more loved, and sadly more alone at the end of it because they often do end up alone. If you are dating a narcissist I highly encourage you, especially if you are married and have children, and even if you don't have children, leading them can be very difficult. if there's any way to get support I would really encourage you to do that. If you're in a relationship now and you're , God these things are kind of true but I love him, I love her, I'm attached, still consider therapy or talking to someone, working through this, getting books, reading, , listening to podcasts to begin to understand that the deeper you go these issues will not get better. They will only get worse and more difficult and painful for you. All guys, I hope you will find this video helpful. Please don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell and feel free to post whatever you think I forgot. Thanks much for watching. Stay safe and I will see you next time. Bye. Bye.
