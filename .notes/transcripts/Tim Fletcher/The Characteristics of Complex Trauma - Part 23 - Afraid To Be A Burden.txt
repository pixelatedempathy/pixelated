Well, welcome to another Friday night. We're looking at a deeper study of the 60 characteristics of complex trauma. The things that people did to cope and survive in dangerous situations, now in adult life are not working. They're causing problems. And that's what the 60 characteristics are. All the old coping things and the consequences of it that are now making life painful today. And today we're coming to a key characteristic that comes out of complex trauma, which is the fear of being a burden or a pain. The fear of being annoying because you have needs. In a healthy home, what happens is the understanding is there that your needs are just as important as my needs. One's not better than the other. We're both equal. And so we are going to learn. We're going to learn how to love each other in a way that your needs get met and my needs get met. Sometimes, though, I will have to sacrifice my needs in order to meet your needs. And sometimes you'll sacrifice your needs to meet mine. But overall, it'll be equal still. There might be times where I have to sacrifice for an extended period of time. And I'm willing to accept that. So you would get that with a brand-new chair. So you would get that with a brand-new chair. There's no difference between giving back and not giving back. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. Then you sacrifice. But eventually, they grow up and are able to give back. But eventually, they grow up and are able to give back. Or if there's someone who has major health problems, you sacrifice for an extended period of time. But for the most part, the family is about meeting each other's needs. So that's a healthy home. But what happens in complex trauma is very important. very different complex trauma always will have somebody in the leadership position who abuses authority who has narcissistic tendencies who's a narcissist and so when a narcissist has a family a child at first they're very excited because they want to show this child off because it creates these warm feelings inside of them they feel loved and they love getting hugged by the child it's a beautiful beautiful thing but after a while this child their needs don't go away they have lots of needs they need time they need attention they need the parent to make sacrifices to go without sleep sometimes and to a narcissist they don't like that that's cramping their style that's keeping them from getting having everything the way they want it they like it and so sadly what can happen in many in my work a lot of times I'm in a situation that's really hard and I'm not poems is that the narcissist distorts reality and says to the child you're being selfish for having needs instead of admitting that they the parent are being selfish and not wanting to sacrifice they twist it and tell the child you're being selfish and so the child begins to get the message that they're a burden that they're making life inconvenient for the people caring for them and so they begin to develop this shame I I don't like feeling like I'm making everybody else's life Miserable that must mean I'm a terrible person and so it begins to do a lot of damage because the child is always feeling that they're a burden sometimes the the parent will say to them stop being selfish sometimes the parent will do other things and will come to that just a bit so let me give you 18 questions a little test to see if you have the characteristics of a person who sees themselves as potentially being a burden or who's afraid of being a burden to others so number one you find it very hard to ask for help number two you're afraid that you'll inconvenience people if you ask them for help three you're afraid to burden people with your problems you're afraid to put too much on people who are already busy and have their own situations to deal with number five you think that everyone is just too busy for you or they all have their own problems they just don't have time for me you don't think you are a priority or you're worthy you don't think you are a priority or you're worthy of other people's time or energy you're not that valuable or you never want to be too much for people because they might abandon you if they find you're just too much or some go to this you are afraid to look weak or to look dependent or to look needy that would be a terrible thing to reveal or some go this way I am proud I am a strong independent person and you pride yourself on how self-sufficient you are or you were trained or you trained yourself to conclude that the goal in life and the sign of being healthy is to not need anybody to be self-sufficient or as a child you were validated for taking on lots of responsibilities and never having asking for help you were always helping others you were super responsible and that's what got you validation so now you could not reveal need or weakness you think people will judge you if you ask for help they'll think you're incompetent to do things on your own or you convinced yourself that you don't have needs you've shut down so much internally you're not even aware of your own needs or if you meet somebody and they talk about how tired they are or how busy they are or that they're having a hard day you then go okay I can't ask that person anything I can't share honestly about what's going on in my life because then there I'll be a burden to them so you shut it down now what's the result of this internally is you often feel abandoned you often feel that nobody really cares for you or you grow up and you're more alert to the needs of others than you are to your own needs you can tell what everybody else in the room needs you just don't know what you need or when you have a need and you need help to get that need met instead of admitting it to yourself what you tell yourself is the only reason you have that need and think you need others is because you're weak you're lazy you're just too tired you're having a bad day so you can't be honest with yourself that you need others you explain it in different ways finally you conclude that the reason you have needs is because you're lazy so 18 characteristics how did you do so if you say Wow okay I have this problem that leads us to the next question where did it come from what caused it so let me give you a couple things the first one is it has to do with our parents and I want to give you 18 characteristics of parents that produce this fear of being a burden in a child. So number one, you had a narcissistic parent who taught you that you were selfish for asking for anything. And we just talked about that. Or you had a parent who sighed or rolled their eyes whenever you asked for anything. Or you had a parent who was sick or depressed and they couldn't take care of you and you felt like a burden to them. Or you had a workaholic parent who was always stressed out all the time and became exasperated whenever some new situation came up. And that included if you were to ask for anything. Or you had a parent who was so focused on looking good, their image, that negative emotions like a child crying, a child being afraid, a child habeas 컷 having a need and expressing it was perceived as weakness it made them look bad as a parent that they weren't doing their job so they shamed you and made you feel guilty for crying or showing fear or you had a parent who was great with all the other kids in the neighborhood and was was always spending time doing fun stuff with them but didn't seem to have time for you or you had a parent who parentified you who relied on you for emotional support instead of relying on their spouse and so now you can't have a problem where you have to rely on them or when you ask the parent for something they made it all about them they then went don't you know how busy I am don't you know how much many responsibilities I have don't you know how difficult it is to be a parent and how difficult it is to be a parent and how difficult my life is all of a sudden it became all about them or you had a parent who never tried to understand you and your needs never got you or you had a parent who without you even realizing it made you feel invisible wanted you to not have needs encouraged you validated you for not having needs they made you they made you invisible so you had to be unseen and unheard or parents who made a child a hero and that child always had to be super responsible could never have needs but had to meet the needs of others or you had a parent that expected you to learn a new skill the first time you attempted it and you had to do it perfectly the first time if you didn't if you failed if you did a so-so job they became impatient with you or you had a parents that said you only need family you don't need anybody else and you shouldn't need anybody else or you had parents who taught you don't tell others about our family problems we don't air our dirty laundry so you just keep all those negative things inside of you and never share them with anybody or you had a parent who always played the victim who was always super needy it was always poor me oh i had got a bad headache today oh i'm feeling depressed today oh i'm feeling so tired today and you hated having a parent like that and were determined so get some rest upon your cadaver if you could share some Vänern sáti now if you've never taught about what is detachment so or your dad was so exhausted by the end of the day they could hardly move off the couch and you never wanted to bother them or final one you had a parent who always had something new they complained about some new problems some new illness some new stress in their life so if you had a parent like that I hope you can see you would end up feeling like a burden because of what that parent communicated but then there's some other scenarios that could create this for you as a child if you had parents who were both playing the victim a narcissist and enabler and you had to try to parent your siblings you had to parent your up your parents you had to be the responsible one in the family then you were caring for everybody else's needs but you couldn't have needs of your own or if you had a family where there's constant fighting conflict anger tension often a child thinks the way to help my family is to not have needs because when I have needs it just creates more anger and tension or maybe you were a child who was a burden because you had a chronic illness you were a sick child and you saw the toll it took on your parents and you never want to be that to anybody else today so those all feed into an attitude that says I never want to be a burden but what happens if you adopt that attitude and you don't want to be a burden and you don't want to be a burden and you don't want to be a burden that is because the burden is in your attitude well you burn yourself out you realize we need people we were made to be self-sufficient totally independent and so what happens by not putting any of your needs on others but putting all your needs on yourself you add to your own burden and you end up burning yourself out and then that can lead to depression that can lead to a deep loneliness feeling that nobody cares about my life that can feed shame nobody cares about me I must I'm not good enough I'm failing I'm a loser and that can take people into just feeling what's the point and then it leads to a relapse so people who are afraid to ask for help and want to try to do it all by themselves often set themselves up to fail and that can lead to relapse for many but more than that one of the reasons we have needs is because it drives us to connect with people and its connection with people that is the core piece in being healthy and so if I try to be independent and never connect with people I'm not going to be able to do it because I'm afraid to do it and I'm not going to be able to connect with anybody I can end up with major mental health issues due to that lack of connection I can end up with physical health issues due to that lack of connection due to the extra stress I put on myself so it can lead to mental health it can lead to physical health issues it can lead to what somebody has said the fear of burdening another person has prevented me from letting anyone close to my heart or even into my life. This and the fear of being viewed as a burden. It gets in the way of intimate, healthy relationships. So the consequences can be severe. So let me just kind of develop how important it is to understand we need people. Because so many people from complex trauma come into recovery determined, if I just get enough information, I can do this alone. If I just get enough tools, I can do this alone. But do you realize we can't do it alone? So understand a couple things. Every organization, every organism is built where we need others. So look at the human body. My nose can't say, I don't need the other parts of my body. My heart can't say, I don't need the other parts of my body. We are built as a body, as an organism, that we need all kinds of different parts to perform their functions. We need that if we're going to be healthy. You look at an organization. You need people with different skill sets who can bring different strengths. To that organization, if that is going to be a healthy, thriving organization. We're designed that we don't have all the skill sets. We need other skill sets. Take that further. In infancy, we have total dependence. As we move to adulthood, we move out of total dependence. But some people think adulthood should mean total dependence. Well, independence, the opposite of total dependence. But what I want you to understand, the healthy design is the infant is totally dependent. Adulthood is healthy interdependence. So I'm not totally dependent, but I'm not totally independent. There's a healthy interdependence. Third, what I just shared about needs. If you think about it, why does a child, a baby, why are they totally dependent? Why do they have so many needs? Why aren't they born with the ability to feed themselves, to walk, to talk? Because needs drive us to connect. And connection is what leads to true happiness. And so needs are actually this ingenious thing that is designed to bring people together so that they can experience the fulfillment of their deepest longing, which is healthy connection, so they can experience it. So needs are part of that. But then think of Western culture, Western society. We are becoming an increasingly fractured society where we are all about trying to be self-sufficient, where there is not healthy interdependence and connection. And so because of divorce, rampant, there's fracturing. Because of the ease of travel, you don't have the same family and extended family living in the same community anymore. You have people living all over the world from the same family who don't connect more than once a year or once every few years. Used to be that children were raised in a village, they would say. It takes a village to raise a child. But now everybody's off doing their own things. Families are spread all over and children are being raised just by the primary caretakers, caregiver there's not that village in extended family anymore to help in the raising of the child so all those things go together to create this mindset of I got to be strong I got to do this myself I can't rely on others because our society is so fractured and families are all over and I'm not close to anybody and it sets us up to become very unhealthy so let's move to the healing stuff the change so what I don't want you to hear is I need to go out now and tell everybody my needs I want to start with a caution you should only tell people about your needs if they are safe people because if you tell an unsafe person about your needs it could be disastrous it could reinforce all of the things that you heard growing up that made you feel like a burden so let me say this a narcissist if you were to tell them your needs at first they would be so caring so giving they would be there to help you over and over until it wasn't fun for them anymore and then they would change on you and then they would start to accuse you of being selfish and it would be disastrous for you or you could tell another unsafe unsafe person your needs and what that for them means is I will help you but you now owe me and you're now in my debt and you don't want that or you could tell an unsafe person your needs and what they're hearing is you want me to meet your needs but now I am going to try and run your life for you I will be my self-appointed mentor of you and teacher of you and I will now meddle in your life so be very careful that you don't choose unsafe people to tell your needs too but then understand this you will go to safe people and for the most part they will meet your need and that will be kind of a new experience for you but some safe people at times are going to have to say to you sorry I can't meet your need today and you're going to feel all your old stuff triggered nobody cares about me see I'm a burden to everybody and it's going to make you want to run and shut down and never ask anybody again so understand this when somebody says no or sets a boundary that's going to trigger your limbic brain but get out of that into your cortex and go okay did they say no because I'm a burden or because they just have too much on their plate right now process through it so that you don't go down the old ways in your mind and in your behaviors be aware of this of a tendency you might have in yourself some people they're afraid to ask people for help they're afraid to express their needs because they're afraid people say no so what they do is they create a crisis and everybody comes running and then they go see I didn't need to tell anybody my needs I just need to create a crisis and all of a sudden they're little drama producers chaos producers crisis producers here's what happens people come running for a while but then they catch on to what you're doing and they stop coming and then you begin to go okay that's not working anymore but I'm still afraid to ask for help. And now if I ask for help, there's going to be a greater probability that they're going to say, sorry, we've got to set a boundary with you because you've caused so much drama in our life. We're not going to go there. And so you could create what you're trying to avoid. Now let me just switch to, let's say somebody comes to you and asks for help. Now, there's a couple of things you need to be aware of. So the first thing is, think of it from the perspective of parenting. If my one-year-old asks me to help feed them soup, I do it because they're not yet capable of feeding themselves, of meeting that need. If my 20-year-old asks me to feed them their soup, I go, no, there's something wrong here. So what I'm doing with that one-year-old is I'm asking them to help feed themselves. Yes, I'm meeting that need for them, but I'm also teaching them the tools so that they learn how to feed themselves so they eventually can feed themselves and not need me for that need anymore. And so what you understand as a parent is child has many needs, but you teach them tools so that they can meet more and more needs on their own, but you help them also recognize there's still going to be some needs, even as an adult, they'll need others for help. So as I work with people, I want to ask, where are they at in their growth? Are they still kind of infant when it comes to their toolbox and their abilities? Or do they have the tools to feed themselves? So that leads to a question. If I help somebody who's still at an infant and doesn't have the tools, they need my help. That's a good thing to do. But if I help somebody who has tools but is just not wanting to use them or is lazy, I would not be loving by doing it for them. I would be enabling them to not grow up, to remain stuck where they're at in their immaturity. So when people come and ask me for help, I need to be able to ask, where are they at? Can they do it for themselves? Do they have the tools? If not, then I will help them. If they do, I shouldn't help them, but kind of pressure them to use the tools that they have. The next thing that I ask is, as I've gotten to know this person, do they implement tools as they learn them? Or do they just acquire tools as academic knowledge but never implement them? And some people do that. And they're afraid to try and implement them because they're afraid they won't do it perfectly the first time. They're afraid they're going to fail. So they like learning about tools, they're just afraid to implement them. If I see that, then I know I would not be doing a favour to them by doing it for them. I need to resist doing it for them and pressure them to do it themselves. Another thing that I ask sometimes when people come and ask for help with their needs is, okay, this need that they have, is it because they're just lazy? Is it because they keep procrastinating on all their responsibilities? So if I help them, am I going to be reinforcing laziness, procrastination? Those are things I have to consider as well. Another thing that often happens is, people have such a great fear of making the wrong decision, that they're afraid to do it. That they come to me and they want me to help them think through decisions. And I do that. Here's the pros, here's the cons. And that's an important part for them learning how to think and learning how to weigh out different options. And I don't mind doing that. But some will keep coming to me whenever they have any decision that they need to make and I begin to realise, they want me to make their decision for them. Because they're afraid that if they make the decision, they might make a mistake. But if I make it, there's a greater chance they won't make a mistake. And I go, they're dependent on me to do their thinking for them. That's not healthy. And I need to be aware of that. Some people, they come to me wanting help and I give them help. And then they just heap me with praise. They validate me over and over. And I begin to realise with some, they came to me for help, but what they're doing now is more than just appreciation. It's not even appreciation. They're now playing me. They're now trying to pad my ego, build me up, so that they can manipulate me. So that I'll like them, so that I'll look up to them. And that's not healthy either. So there's a bunch of different things that are important for you to be aware of when people come and ask for help. Okay, so let's, wrap up, how do we grow in this area? So again, it's being aware that I need to approach safe people. But then, when you have a need, and you're aware that you have a need, assess, okay, what is my responsibility when it comes to meeting this need? And you might find out I'm 100% responsible to feed myself. I can't go and ask others to feed me. Or, I, you know what, I need to be a parent to my children. And I, I'm a single mom. And I'm 90%. I gotta be there consistently for my kids. But I need a break sometimes. I need people to help me. So I can't 100% meet that need without burning out. So I need to begin to look for people who could meet that need. And that's where it gets tricky because some people, they just run back to their biological family and say, can you take care of the kids today? But their biological family is very unhealthy. And they get hurt every time. And the children are getting unhealthy stuff passed on to them. But they don't take the time to build new relationships. They're afraid to ask people outside the family for help. And so they keep running back to their own family. And they keep getting hurt. And so you have to be, prepared to move out of your comfort zone. To move out of what's easy to do. And do some hard things. And ask people for help when everything in you is afraid to do that. You have to go through fear. You have to go through discomfort. And you have to move out of your comfort zone. But then retrain your conscience. So that what you've had before is asking others for help. You feel guilty. Now you have to go, it's alright to ask people for help. So I ask people for help, but I'm still going to feel guilty. But that's my limbic brain. That's the old stuff. I can push past that. And the more you push past that, and you keep asking for help in healthy ways, your conscience gets retrained. And it doesn't bother you anymore. Now let me give you just this thing to think about. You know, for a child in complex trauma, expressing a need and asking for help usually resulted in being told you're selfish. You were humiliated. You were shamed. And so part of what was going on there dynamics wise is not just was your need not met, but you went through the emotional pain of humiliation. Here's what I want you to understand. Now, to express a need means you have to humble yourself. And that's scary for a person from complex trauma because I have to be vulnerable. I have to admit I have a need. I have to go to somebody. Humbling myself makes me afraid they're going to humiliate me. But understand this. When you humble yourself and go to your safe person, they will never humiliate you. Your humility will not result in humiliation. But only if you humble yourself. But only if you have safe people. So there's two very important pieces here in getting our needs met. Both parties become involved. I need humility, but I need safe people. And when you put the two together, then you get your needs met in a healthy way. And then continue to deal with the shame that came out of feeling like a burden. Feeling like you weren't good enough. And again, we see over and over again that this shame piece is such a huge part of our healing journey. Continue to work on that. It is all part of the process. Okay, that's the end of part one. We're going to take a short break. Then I'll come back and do a Christian part. If that doesn't interest you, no problem. You're free to go. We'll see you next week. To everybody else, I'll be back in just a minute. Thank you. well welcome back we started a couple weeks ago a study of the life of one of my favorite Bible characters Joseph he's known for saving the world and Israel from this famine that took place many years ago but what I want us to understand is Joseph experienced a tremendous amount of trauma both within his family and outside of his family and last two weeks we've been looking at kind of the unhealthy stuff within his family there was a lot of sick stuff going on there today I want you to see the the main traumas that came out of his family and it is quite heartbreaking and many of you will have experienced it but let me start with the very first thing as we read about Joseph it says this in Genesis 37 this is the account of Jacob and his family when Joseph was 17 years old he often tended his father's flocks he worked for his half brothers the sons of his father's wives Bella and zilpa but Joseph reported to his father some some of the bad things his brothers were doing so the very first word we're given of Joseph saying something he's ratting out his brothers he's telling his dad what they're doing when they're way off in the distance taking care of the sheep and it's some very bad stuff now some people look at this and and see Joseph in a negative light he's he's a rat a tattletale but I think the reason we're told this about Joseph is to show that no this isn't a weakness in Joseph this is a strength Joseph from a young boy has a character that says I want what is right I want to love people I want to treat people properly with respect and when I see my brothers hurting people doing things that are wrong I want to stop that and so we see that from a young boy as a matter of fact he grew up in a family where there's all kinds of sexual perversion where there's all kinds of anger hatred hurting each other Joseph as a young boy says I want to live by love I want to do what is right and so we see this amazing young man developing who's committed to living by God's design to live by a healthy standard it's a beautiful thing to see but then we get this because of what Joseph did and then a couple other things that we're going to see now Jacob loved Joseph more than any of his other children because Joseph had been born to him in his old age his father favors him over the other children so one day Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph a beautiful robe so for some of you growing up in Sunday school this was referred to as the coat of many colors we don't know for sure what that the the Hebrew word means in referring to this robe but there's basically two things that seem clear by Joseph wearing this robe that his father gave him what Jacob was saying was number one Joseph you don't have to work like your brothers you don't have to work as hard number two you're going to get the main part of the inheritance even though you're one of the youngest of the children you're going to get special treatment so what happens his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than them so they respond out of anger and hatred to Joseph this favorite this pet they couldn't say a single kind word to him so Joseph is bullied Joseph is constantly having his brothers take shots at him say hurtful things to him beat him up do other hurtful things to him he is constantly being bullied and put down a very very difficult thing for a young boy to grow up in and many of you have grown up in it and then we're told this one night Joseph had a dream and when he told his brothers about it they hated him more than ever so what is this dream he says listen to this dream he said we were on the field tying up bundles of grain suddenly my bundle stood up and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before me in other words Joseph is saying one day you guys are going to bow before me now I think what Joseph is trying to do here is say brothers it's right that dad's favoring me because I will someday be over you I will someday rule you someday you will admire me and bow before me out of reverence I think he's trying to help them get over their hatred help them to accept his favored positions but we're told his Brothers hated him all the more respond so you think you will be our king do you do you actually think you will reign over us and they hated him all the more because of his dreams and he had a second dream and he told them about it and by the way he talked about them soon Joseph had another dream and again he told his brothers and about it and he listened I had another dream and the sun and the moon and the 11 stars bowed low before me. So Joseph is making things worse when he's trying to make them better. Joseph is feeding into his brother's hatred of him. So here's what I want you to think about and many of you can relate to what Joseph went through. He didn't just have one sibling that was bullying him that hated him. He had 10. Older brothers who all hated him who bullied him who beat him up who said every hurtful thing they could say he was bombarded with it day after day 24 7 and then he had three other mothers that didn't like him three stepmoms who hated him as well who shunned him. Can you imagine? Growing up in that not feeling you belong not feeling love living in constant danger and fear. And then more than that his own mother's dead. He can't go to her for comfort. And if he goes to his dad and his dad comforts him that'll just make his brother's anger worse. And why doesn't his dad stop it? Joseph is hurting big time. And so this kid who was a big kid is traumatized in mega ways. You can just again feel the depression the sadness the frustration the hurt the pain all that Joseph went through. So here again is a young man growing up with a sick family growing up being severely abused by that family but still saying I want to follow God. I want to be healthy. I don't want to adopt the same hatred that my brothers have to me. I want to be free of hatred. I want to have love. And in the weeks ahead we're going to look at what enabled Joseph to be this this young man and then it continued and he was that as an adult as well. And I just hope it encourages you that okay I can choose a different way. I can choose a different way. I can choose a different way. I can choose to be healthy. I can heal from all of these wounds that are very similar to Joseph's and I can grow to become a healthy person. Let's pray. Father again we're just grateful for this story in the Bible that somebody who is very very godly isn't that because they had an easy life isn't that because everything was perfect for them but they chose to be that in light of a very painful life where everything was against them and just help us to do the same. Amen. Well that's our Friday. Thank you again for being with us.
