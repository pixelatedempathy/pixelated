Hey everyone it's Dr. Ramani. Welcome back to this YouTube channel on everything you wanted, didn't want to know, and things you didn't even know you didn't know about narcissism. So we're going to be taking on a very interesting question today of what the narcissist does when they lose their scapegoat. Before we get to that, gentle reminder if you want information on the healing program that we're starting this year please go to the video notes, click that link to get the information, and then we are going to also mostly going to remind you to please subscribe to this channel if you're new to this community. Always feel free to share comments about this because that's where we actually sometimes get more new ideas and it allows the conversation to expand. So thank you again for being part of this YouTube community and let's answer this question. What does the narcissist do when they lose their scapegoat? Well for any of you who are currently or have been a scapegoat with a narcissist this is a question that comes up a lot like because there's a lot of fantasy around it like what happens when they no longer have me. Let's break it down and I would also love to hear from you. If any of you were the scapegoat and you did finally find a way to step away what happened when you stepped away? It's very very very hard for the scapegoat to pull away from the narcissist. The trauma bonding is so intense but let's talk about it. The scapegoat to be the scapegoat this is a term that is most often used to describe the role somebody has in a narcissistic family system. It's the person or people in a family narcissistic family system that get the worst of the narcissistic person's abuse and because of the triangulation the narcissist is often able to recruit other family or other members of the family system to perpetrate more abuse against the scapegoat who over time are able to recruit more abuse against the scapegoat who over time becomes the punching bag for everyone in the family system. The scapegoat is subjected to criticism, mockery, humiliation, rage, sometimes physical or other forms of abuse and becomes the repository of the narcissist's shame. It's as though the mere existence of the scapegoat brings out a sense of shame in the narcissistic person and so they abuse the scapegoat even more. Now scapegoating can happen in other narcissistic systems as well, including workplaces, groups of friends, or even other kinds of organized groups, community groups, you know, any kind of group. It's only since there's a narcissist sort of in that system and there's someone that they're taking something out at, there's a scapegoat in it, right? The narcissist in some ways gets their power from other people watching fearfully at what is happening to the scapegoat and wanting to avoid that fate for themselves. And just like in any cult, other people get pulled into the narcissistic person's magnetic fold and join the scapegoating for any number of reasons. To win over the narcissist, to keep themselves safe in the system, to survive, perhaps to get their own power in the system, and because some of the people who join into the scapegoating are narcissistic themselves. To be a scapegoat is an absolutely terrible way to have to spend a childhood, it impacts attachment, it generates core wounds, it impairs a sense of safety in the world and identity development. Scapegoats may experience significant anxiety, not only in childhood, but also adulthood, self-devaluation, issues with self-esteem, holding limiting beliefs about the self, mood symptoms like depression, and basically scapegoats will spend a lifetime selling themselves short and often don't fully enact their potential. In more serious cases, scapegoats may experience severe cases, scapegoated children as they become older may be at risk for even more dangerous behaviors including self-harm, substance use, disordered eating, and other forms of dangerous acting out. It is an incredibly heavy, painful legacy to carry. However though, here's the million dollar question. What happens when a narcissistic person loses their scapegoat? It's really quite interesting because in many ways the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person is a scapegoat. And in many ways, the narcissistic person uses the scapegoat to regulate. The narcissistic person uses the scapegoat to regulate. The narcissistic person is incapable of regulating disappointment, frustration, stress, or just basically not getting to get their way. So they lash out. And they lash out at easy targets. And the scapegoat is often an easy target. As I said, for any number of reasons, the scapegoat often evokes shame in the narcissist, which obviously leads to rage. And that shame will give them a chance to get out of the way. And get multiplied because the narcissist is aware at some level that their treatment of the scapegoat is not okay and they keep doing it which in essence again the narcissist knows at a deep unprocessed level makes them a horrible person and they can't tolerate that idea of being a horrible person and so bang more rage inevitably directed at the scapegoat i gotta say some of my favorite stories of narcissistic abuse survivorship are when i hear about the scapegoat walking away it sends chills down my spine and joy into my heart because of the trauma bonded nature of the scapegoat narcissistic relationship it's one of the hardest things a person can do walking away may not always be physically walking away and leaving the situation it may in some cases be mentally cutting out but i gotta tell you physically getting out completely is really fantastic it does happen it's not easy now when it does happen when a scapegoat leaves the narcissist a few things happen first the narcissist now has to find a new way to regulate now initially they will continue to lash out at the scapegoat even if they're not there they'll say who do you think you are where the hell did you go do you really think you're going to be able to make it in the world without me you're a loser you're going to be back they'll say those kinds of things that can go on for a while might happen by text you're a loser you're going to be back they'll say those kinds of things that can go on for a while might happen by text or email social media the scapegoat has to be steadfast and be willing to block as much of this contact as possible at some point if the scapegoat can be resolute and not snap back then the narcissistic person needs to find a new person to abuse now there is that day if the scapegoat's gone the narcissist may find some new targets perhaps the enablers in their midst or someone else they devalued but that was the scapegoat was originally spared the worst of the narcissistic person's abuse because the scapegoat was around the scapegoat is why narcissistic people often still have people around them because they were all spared the abuse but when the scapegoat is gone then we may see that the narcissist needs to yell at someone so now more and more people start seeing how bad the narcissist behavior is some may even try to pull the scapegoat back into the system for no other reason so that they can start to see how bad the narcissist behavior is and that's why we're so interested in the scapegoat being a scapegoat and we're so excited about that because we know that the narcissist is not the only one who can stop being yelled at by the narcissist and the scapegoat can take the punches again if you're a scapegoat don't fall for that smear campaigns often arise when scapegoats leave instead of attacking the scapegoat to their face the narcissistic person may then use triangulation criticism of the scapegoat on public spaces like social media or honestly to anyone who will listen maybe even making stuff up about the scapegoat which we will talk about today we developed another beneficiary system that means the there's a process drew from the existingdr known as pride and joy this показывates the narcissistic person's ability to use Winter's non- Breton words to brown our calling person to tough it's never easy to be políticas geomantic and completely stained and so you might want to try a different method of puppy doggo點't ask that an actor is basically the saddest person in the entire franchise if you've been there the people shaking onto this is part two scapegoat may feel pulled back in by the manipulation and the hoovering, or they may step in because they want to protect the people who are now being abused by the narcissist because the scapegoat is no longer there to be abused. Those other people, scapegoat reminder, those other people can get out too. It's not your job to save them. No human being should ever have to be a psychological punching bag for another person, to have to be the pacifier or the regulation tool for another human being. Nobody. That's the narcissistic person's damned responsibility to get some therapy, get a grip, take some personal responsibility, and stop using the world as their emotional toilet. And to the scapegoat, remember that you owe the narcissistic person and frankly the people around them nothing. And I'm not saying that you owe the person who's been abused. I'm not saying that you owe the scapegoat. I'm not saying that you owe the person who's been abused. I'm not saying that you owe the themselves for everything. I'm not saying that you owe others for everything. I swear I don't owe any of those people shit. I'm saying that because they know it. I know you owe them for your fun, because they know you made them suffer, but it's also my responsibility to be patient about what you already and how you thank them. That's a beautiful analogy, the başka loop of a book, but on a really deep level, we're going to talk about the genie of웄s geometry. There is one person, I want to give it to, who Indigenous series is about trough. It is the generation of men trying to accept that there's some sort of ox corps or some sort of event, the action is run by them and what they do is just metabolic based침 bite, to abuse you. And this is actually just, again, not only supposed to be very negative, You deserve so much better than what they did and are doing to you. So I hope you heed that because let's face it, at the end of the day, someone else is going to take the narcissist's rage or it just eats them up inside. Thanks again.
