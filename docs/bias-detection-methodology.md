# Bias Detection Engine Methodology & Algorithm Documentation

## Overview

The Pixelated Empathy Bias Detection Engine is designed to identify, quantify, and mitigate bias in AI-assisted therapeutic training simulations. It ensures fair and equitable treatment across all demographic groups by leveraging a multi-layer analysis framework, integrating industry-leading fairness toolkits, and providing real-time monitoring and actionable recommendations.

## Methodology

### Multi-Layer Analysis Framework

The engine employs a four-layer approach to bias detection:

1. **Pre-processing Layer** (spaCy/NLTK)
   - Detects linguistic bias and problematic terminology
   - Analyzes demographic representation in session transcripts
   - Performs sentiment analysis to identify emotionally charged or exclusionary language
   - Flags biased terminology and language patterns

2. **Model-Level Detection** (IBM AIF360)
   - Computes algorithmic fairness metrics (e.g., disparate impact, statistical parity)
   - Assesses demographic parity and equalized odds
   - Applies constraint-based fairness optimization to model outputs
   - Integrates with zero-bias training environments for robust evaluation

3. **Interactive Analysis Layer** (Google What-If Tool)
   - Enables counterfactual analysis to explore "what-if" scenarios
   - Evaluates feature importance and sensitivity to input changes
   - Supports interactive bias exploration and scenario-based testing
   - Facilitates cultural sensitivity monitoring and alternative therapeutic approaches

4. **Evaluation Layer** (Hugging Face evaluate + Microsoft Fairlearn)
   - Aggregates NLP bias metrics across sessions and demographics
   - Validates fairness constraints and performance disparities
   - Generates comprehensive bias reports and recommendations
   - Benchmarks system accuracy and compliance with ethical standards

### Key Toolkits & Libraries

- **spaCy** / **NLTK**: Advanced NLP for linguistic and sentiment analysis
- **IBM AIF360**: Fairness metrics and bias mitigation algorithms
- **Google What-If Tool**: Interactive, counterfactual analysis
- **Microsoft Fairlearn**: Constraint-based fairness validation
- **Hugging Face evaluate**: NLP bias and performance metrics
- **scikit-learn**, **pandas**, **numpy**: Data processing and ML utilities

## Algorithmic Steps

1. **Session Ingestion**: Collects session data, including transcripts, AI responses, and participant demographics.
2. **Pre-processing**: Applies NLP techniques to detect linguistic bias and analyze demographic representation.
3. **Model-Level Analysis**: Evaluates fairness metrics and applies bias mitigation strategies using AIF360.
4. **Interactive Exploration**: Generates counterfactual scenarios and evaluates feature importance.
5. **Evaluation & Reporting**: Aggregates results, validates fairness constraints, and produces actionable recommendations.

## Metrics & Reporting

- **Overall Bias Score**: Aggregated score across all layers (0.0â€“1.0)
- **Alert Levels**: Low, Medium, High, Critical (based on thresholds)
- **Demographic Fairness**: Bias scores by group (gender, age, ethnicity, etc.)
- **Counterfactual Scenarios**: Alternative outcomes and recommendations
- **Comprehensive Reports**: Exportable in JSON, CSV, PDF formats

## Recommendations Generation

The engine generates recommendations based on detected bias patterns, severity, and demographic context. Critical bias scenarios trigger urgent recommendations, while low bias scenarios receive targeted suggestions. Recommendations are tailored to promote ethical AI practices and improve therapeutic outcomes.

## Batch & Background Processing

For large-scale analyses, the engine supports asynchronous job queues and background workers, enabling efficient batch processing and scalable deployment.
