Why is it that in the West especially, but in many countries, narcissists are welcomed as leaders? Why is it that people don't see kind of how destructive they can be and just welcome them with open arms as their savior? And so I want to talk about narcissism and leadership this week and next. So before I dig into that, I want to just say a couple things up front that I hope would just kind of lay the foundation of really understanding this topic. Eleanor Greenberg has written, nobody is a borderline. Nobody is a narcissist. Nobody is a schizoid. So what she is saying is often in our culture today, oh, they're a narcissist. And it's a stigmatized name that we pigeonhole. And she goes, whoa, whoa, whoa, nobody's a narcissist. Nobody's born a narcissist. We might diagnose somebody as narcissistic personality disorder, but what does that mean? And so what she says is this. When we diagnose, we're describing a pattern, a particular gestalt, never a person. All people are unique. Labels, however well intended, cannot do justice to human complexity. And I want to talk about that. And I want to talk about that. And I would agree with her. So what we're really wanting people to understand is people aren't born a narcissist. It's dangerous to just put pigeonhole people and brand them as narcissists. We need to understand that narcissism is a pattern of behavior that has developed in order to protect a deep wound. And it's the outworking of trauma and shame. And so the person develops this way of culture. This way of coping, this way of trying to get their needs met, this way of trying to compensate for their shame. But it's patterns of behavior that if you just focus on them, you miss the real issue, which is the deep wound, the deep shame that drives all of that. So just to develop that, let me just take you back to the original story that led to the term narcissism. And so it comes out of Greek mythology. The myth of narcissists. And so a narcissist is a young man that finds himself thirsty one day. And so he goes to a pool. And as he bends down to get a drink, the pool is perfectly calm. And so he sees his reflection in the pool. And the image is so striking. He's just captivated by his own beauty that he reaches in to embrace himself. But in doing so, he disrupts the water. And so all of a sudden the image is lost. And so he waits till the water comes down, calms down again. And then he sees his beauty again. And he reaches in to embrace it and then disrupts the water. And so what begins to happen is he's desperate to see himself, but he can't embrace it. So he just is immobilized. He sits there and just stares at it as reflection all day. And as a result of that, he's not satisfied. He's not satisfied. He's not meeting any of his other needs. He's neglecting his basic needs because he spends all day staring at himself, absorbed in his own beauty. And so what has come out of that is really defining narcissism as a person who's totally in love with himself, preoccupied with their own beauty, their own image, how they look. And so they need the reflection. They need mirrors or they're called echoes. They need mirrors or they're called echoes to reflect back to them. That's people in their life who tell them how wonderful they are, how much they appreciate them, who validate them constantly. They need that. That's the pattern that develops. So get people in your life who will reflect back to your greatness because you need that constant mirrored back to you that you're wonderful, that you're admired. So that's basically narcissism. So it's all about image. It's all about being admired. It's all about being admired. It's all about power, prestige, control. But if we stop there and then we just brand people, they're a narcissist. We miss what's really going on underneath. What is driving this? So let me just read you a couple of quotes and then kind of expand and explain it. Terence Real has said this. People often think of narcissism as the symbol of excessive self-regard. But in fact, he exemplifies the opposite. As the Renaissance. Philosopher Marsilio Ficino observed in the 1500s, narcissists did not suffer from an overabundance of self-love, but rather from its deficiency. The myth is a parable about paralysis. The youth who first appears in restless motion is suddenly rooted to one spot, unable to leave the elusive spirit. He would let no one touch his heart. This is the wound of shame. One who is deep shame cannot connect and cannot become vulnerable. He is immovable and untouchable. So what they're recognizing right up front is that narcissism, the person is not able to love themself. That's shame. And therefore, because of that, they're not able to be vulnerable to others. They're not able to connect with others because they can't be authentic. And so they become this frozen person seeking. To somehow meet their needs, but never able to connect with others. Ficino goes on to say this. If narcissists had possessed real self-love, he would have been able to leave his fascination. The curse of narcissists is immobilization, not out of love for himself, but out of dependency upon his image. Narcissist is trapped in a vicious narcissistic feedback. He's immobilized from ever growing, from ever really getting his needs met by being captivated or in this feedback loop where he needs others to try to feed his soul. Others to try to meet his needs, others to admire him. And it causes him to be immobilized. He stops growing. The name narcissist comes from the Greek narc, which means numbness. So we get narcotics. It. It's a kind of a. Stupor. It is the sting of addiction that narcissists experiences. Healthy self-love would have motivated him to befriend every wounded and weary part of himself. It would have motivated him to tend to his trauma and his deep wounds in his soul. But self-contempt motivated him to search in vain for what he thought he needed to live, only to die from a neglect of what he really needed. In other words, the narcissist is so deeply wounded, but he thinks he finds a solution that's going to fix him. But he comes addicted to the solution. It seems to work, but it doesn't. It operates like addiction, but he keeps chasing it, looking for the next high of making himself feel better for a moment. But he's not meeting his real needs. He's neglecting what he really needs, the real solution. But he's developing a pattern. And that pattern then gets branded as narcissism. So narcissism is not fundamentally about self-love, but about an escape from love. The fragile little boy goes into hiding and the protective false self takes the lead. So let me read what John Bradshaw writes. And John Bradshaw has written extensively about shame issues. And we've talked about that. John Bradshaw writes about shame issues. And we've talked about that. And we've talked about that. John Bradshaw writes about shame issues. And we've talked about that. And we've talked about that. And we've talked about that. And we've talked about that. But he says this, because the exposure of self to self lies at the heart of neurotic shame. So shame basically is I don't like myself. So now I abandon myself. I don't even want to live with myself. I don't want to face myself so I can't be exposed to myself. I'm hiding from myself. So that's at the heart of neurotic shame, the escape from the self becomes self. necessary. So it's all about escaping who I think I am. The escape from self is accomplished by creating a false self. The false self is always more or less than human. So the false self may be a perfectionist, superhuman, or a slob, less than human. A family hero, superhuman, or a family scapegoat don't care about anything anybody. As the false self is formed, the authentic self goes into hiding. Years later, the layers of defense and pretense are so intense that one loses all conscious awareness of who one really is. But the false self isn't an adult. It's a child stuck in adolescence, perpetually replaying outdated ways of getting its needs met in its present adult body. Like narcissists, it looks and looks only to become more isolated, more turned in on itself. It may love the image it has created, but it has no real capacity to love itself. So well said.
