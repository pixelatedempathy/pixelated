# Testing Overview

Pixelated implements a comprehensive testing strategy to ensure reliability, security, and performance across all components. Our testing infrastructure is designed to support rapid development while maintaining high quality standards.

## Testing Pyramid

Our testing approach follows the testing pyramid principle:

- **Unit Tests (Base Layer)**: Individual component testing
- **Integration Tests (Middle Layer)**: Component interaction testing
- **E2E Tests (Top Layer)**: Complete user flow testing

## Key Testing Areas

### Core Functionality

- Authentication flows
- Session management
- Data encryption
- Real-time messaging
- File operations

### External Services

- Email service integration
- Analytics tracking
- Monitoring systems
- Third-party APIs

### Performance

- Load testing
- Stress testing
- Memory usage
- Response times

### Security

- Penetration testing
- Security scanning
- Compliance validation
- Access control verification

## Test Infrastructure

Our testing infrastructure includes:

- **Test Runners**: Vitest and Playwright
- **Mocking**: MSW (Mock Service Worker)
- **Coverage**: C8/Istanbul
- **CI Integration**: GitHub Actions
- **Database**: Test containers and migrations
- **Monitoring**: Test metrics and reporting

## Getting Started

To run tests locally:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run all tests
pnpm test

# Run specific test suites
pnpm run test:unit
pnpm run test:integration
pnpm run test:e2e

# Generate coverage report
pnpm run test:coverage
```
