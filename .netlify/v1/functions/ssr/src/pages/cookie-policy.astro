            Do Not Track Signals
          </h2>
          <p>
            Some browsers include a "Do Not Track" (DNT) feature that signals to
            websites you visit that you do not want to have your online activity
            tracked. Currently, there is no standard for how DNT signals should
            be interpreted. We do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or mechanisms.
