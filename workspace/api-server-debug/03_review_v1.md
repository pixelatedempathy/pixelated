# Execution Review & Feature Delta: api-server-debug (Version 1)

**Status:** Completed
**Completion Date:** Friday, August 29, 2025
**Source Plan:** `/home/vivi/pixelated/workspace/api-server-debug/01_analysis_v1.md`

---

## 1. Summary of Implemented Changes
This feature addressed a critical bug preventing the FastAPI server from starting reliably in the background. The root cause was identified as an incorrect resolution of relative file paths during module import, specifically for the `emotional_pipeline.yaml` configuration file. The solution involved implementing a robust `get_project_root()` utility function that dynamically and correctly identifies the project's top-level directory, and then refactoring the `EmotionalPipeline` to use this utility for all file path resolutions.

## 2. Task-by-Task Breakdown
- **Task:** Create `get_project_root()` Utility
  - **Status:** ✅ Completed
  - **Summary of Changes:** Created `ai/pixel/utils/path_utils.py` with a `get_project_root()` function. This function was refactored to correctly identify the outermost `pyproject.toml` in the directory tree, ensuring it returns the true project root even in nested project structures. A dedicated test `tests/ai/pixel/test_utils.py` was created and passed.
- **Task:** Refactor `EmotionalPipeline` to Use Absolute Path
  - **Status:** ✅ Completed
  - **Summary of Changes:** Modified `ai/pixel/pipeline/emotional_pipeline.py` to import `get_project_root()` and use it within the `EmotionalPipeline`'s `__init__` method. The `config_path` is now constructed as an absolute path relative to the dynamically resolved project root.
- **Task:** Verify the Fix
  - **Status:** ✅ Completed
  - **Summary of Changes:** Re-ran the original API server verification command. After ensuring no lingering processes were occupying the port, the server started successfully, and the `curl` command received a valid JSON response from the `/analyze` endpoint.

## 3. Test Evidence
- **Verification Steps:**
  - `source .venv/bin/activate && pytest tests/ai/pixel/test_utils.py` (for Task 1)
  - `source .venv/bin/activate && uvicorn api.emotional_engine_api:app > uvicorn_error.log 2>&1 & PID=$! && sleep 5 && curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "I am happy"}' http://127.0.0.1:8000/analyze && kill $PID` (for Task 3)
- **Final Verification:** The API server now starts reliably and serves requests, confirming the path resolution issue is resolved.
