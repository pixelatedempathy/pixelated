## Custom Commands & Workflows

### Frequently Used Commands
```bash
# Development workflow
pnpm install                  # Install dependencies
pnpm run dev                  # Start development server
pnpm run build               # Production build
pnpm run test                # Run test suite
pnpm run lint                # Lint and fix code

# Docker workflow
docker-compose up -d         # Start all services
docker-compose down          # Stop all services
docker build -t pixelated .  # Build container

# Memory Bank management (custom)
# Note: These would typically be custom commands but can be executed manually:
# - Update memory bank files after significant changes
# - Review all memory bank documentation before project decisions
```

### Custom Memory Bank Commands
The Memory Bank system is now fully operational with working file-based commands:

1. **Update Memory Bank**: Ask Cline to "**update memory bank**" after significant changes
2. **Read Context**: Reference `memory-bank/activeContext.md` for custom commands and context
3. **Add Custom Commands**: Edit `memory-bank/activeContext.md` to add your own workflows
4. **Review Changes**: Use `git diff memory-bank/` to see documentation updates
5. **Search Documentation**: `grep "custom" memory-bank/activeContext.md` to find command examples
6. **Validate Setup**: All 6 core files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `progress.md`) are now established and ready for customization

## Performance & Metrics Goals

### Service Level Objectives (SLOs)
- **API Response Time**: <100ms P95
- **Uptime**: 99.9%
- **Accuracy**: >95% for bias detection
- **Throughput**: 1000 requests/second

### Monitoring Setup

- [ ] Grafana dashboards
- [ ] Alert manager configuration
- [ ] Log aggregation with ELK stack

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Model Quality**: Without trained models, core value proposition is blocked
- **Performance**: AI inference performance may not meet real-time requirements
- **Scalability**: Initial architecture may need significant refactoring

### Medium Risk
- **Integration Complexity**: Multiple technologies may introduce complexity
- **Security**: Need thorough security review before production deployment
- **User Adoption**: May require UX/UI work to drive user engagement

### Low Risk
- **Technology Choices**: Well-established technologies with strong community support
- **Team Dependencies**: No external team dependencies identified

## Future Considerations
- Multi-cloud deployment strategy
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Machine learning model marketplace
- API ecosystem and partnerships
- Mobile application development
