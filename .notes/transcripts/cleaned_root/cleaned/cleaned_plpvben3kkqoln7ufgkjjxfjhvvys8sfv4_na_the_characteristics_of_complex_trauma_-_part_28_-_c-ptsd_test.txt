As you can see, I am not in my normal filming location.  Kim and I decided to take a short work vacation to get a break and get some rest.  We have got some work done.  So I decided to film here and I want to do something a little bit differently tonight.  We have been going through this 60 characteristics of complex trauma and one of the common questions that I get from people is one of the common statements I hear from people is I grew up in a really good home.  I do not think I have complex trauma.  So over the last number of years I have been working in my brain to create a test that will help people get a clear picture or sense of whether or not they have complex trauma.  So tonight and next Friday, I want to give you two tests that I hope will give you insight into whether or not you have complex trauma and how severe that complex trauma might be.  And I hope you will find it helpful and insightful.  So let's get started.  It's got 64 questions that I want you to answer tonight.

You have been part of intimate relationships where there's been a double standard.  The rules were different for one person in the relationship than they were for the other.  So the one person was allowed to check up on you but not you on them.  They could check your phone or your Facebook but not the other way around.  The other person could show certain emotions like anger but you could not and you could not show sadness or fear.  See, the other person was allowed their choice of friends and activities but you were not allowed the same choices with your friends and activities.  54.

And so some of those areas might be there.  How angry they were.  Or that they were perfectionists or how critical they were or negative.  Or they always went into a victim mentality and now you find the same things in yourself.  Or the way they responded to you when you were hurt or sad or crying, you find sometimes you respond the same way to your kids.  Or see, the things you say to yourself in your head, you find are exactly the things your parents said to you and you hated it when they said those things to you but now you say those same things to yourself.  57.  You do not like the way you are and your solution is not to persist at the hard work to change who you are but a to blame mothers for your problems.  Be, look for someone like a counselor or a teacher or program to fix you.  See, look for an easy magic solution that will just quickly fix you and will not require hard work.  58.  You do not feel like your age.  You may be 40 but you feel that your emotional age is about 10 or that you have the tool kit of a 20 year old, not a 40 year old.  8.  If you feel you stop growing emotionally at some point and stopped accumulating healthy tools for living, so your body kept getting older but parts of you stopped growing.  Be because that you do not know who you really are and see you do not know how to identify your emotions or handle them.  59.  You are not sure what love is.

When you are in an intimate relationship, you struggle a lot with jealousy.  You think they will find somebody better than you or B, you become obsessed with whether or not they are cheating on you.  Or see you offer a lot of sex, hoping it will keep them interested in you.  61.  When a relationship comes to an end, you find it very hard to let go.  60.  When a relationship comes to an end, you find it hard to let go.  A, you cyberstock that person, B, you remain obsessed with them thinking about them all the time.  60.  You find it very hard to move on and sometimes you become very depressed.  D, you get angry if you learn that they are dating someone else.  E, you sometimes become promiscuous, hoping it will help you forget about them and move on.  62.  Sitting in a painful emotion for more than a few minutes is extremely hard for you.  A, it triggers you to want to find an escape.  B, it triggers anxiety and panic that you might be stuck here or see it feels so unresolvable that it makes you feel hopeless very quickly.  63.  You sometimes have these thoughts about yourself.  A, that deep down you are just not good enough.  You do not measure up.  You are less than others around you.  B, that in order to get people to like you, you must be willing to go against your needs, your morals, your values and do whatever they want you to do.  C, in order to get people to respect you, you must be perfect.  D, in order to get people to respect you, you must be better than everybody else around you.

D, to make you more outgoing and popular.  E, to make you feel connected to people.

So, how did you do?  For some of you, you may have found that you got quite a few of those.  And this might feel quite overwhelming and you might feel quite broken.  Again, I encourage you to get help, look into our lift program.  For others of you, you might see that the first ten were true of you which should be definitely indicative of more severe trauma.  And a lot of work that would need to be done in the months ahead.

But again, all of that is just to show you areas that are not healthy.  Areas in your life where you have been using the wrong tools.  And it's a roadmap for the things that you need to work on to get healthy.  So I just hope that this will be helpful to you because this has been a bit longer today.  We are not going to have the Christian part.
