This week's test is based on the ACE test, the adverse childhood experiences which was a test designed to see if a child had trauma and the effects of that trauma and it consisted of 10 questions and what became evident was that it was a very useful tool but it did not give a comprehensive picture of complex trauma it only gave a picture of single event trauma and I was reading Dr.  Bruce Perry and he was saying when this test first came out the response was much like the scientific community response to everything which was they just ignore it because it's new and then they begin to criticize it and try to find flaws with it and that's what happened with the ACE test and that's what's happened with the concept of complex trauma and trauma in general but now they are at a point where they are accepting it and fully adopting it and seeing the value of it but he feels very strongly that it's a great tool but not complete tool and so I have been giving a lot of thought to what would be questions that could be asked to help people explore their childhood, their upbringing, what their family of origin was like that would help them get a sense of whether they had complex PTSD and so that's the focus of this test it's not looking on how you are responding and adult life it's looking at what life was like for you growing up in your home and hopefully again it will give you a lot of insight now let me say two things for some of you you are going to go through the 60 some questions that I am going to give and you are going to answer some of them and you are going to go oh does that mean I have complex trauma not necessarily the more questions that you answer affirmatively the greater the chance that you have complex trauma if you only have one or two it just is an alert to you that you need to be aware and think about how did that affect me and the second thing that I want to say before we start our test is I am not out to bash parents I am not out to blame parents there's no perfect parents what I am out is to understand unhealthy things in parenting styles that impact the kids negatively so that when they get older it could set them up for problems and that's all this is is to give you insight into how things in your family of origin might have affected you so let's get started we are going to start with the ACE test and then we are going to go to 50 plus more questions that I have come up with that I hope will just add to the effectiveness of understanding if you have complex PTSD so let's begin with the ACE test 10 questions and you put no or yes and basically the research is about how many of the tens of you have three to ten then certain risks that will be true of you four to ten even greater risk of certain things etc so question one did a parent or adult in the household often or very often swear at you insult you put you down or humiliate you or act in a way that made you afraid that you might be physically hurt question two did a parent or other adult in the household often or very often push grab slap or throw something at you or ever hit you so hard that your you had marks or were injured question three did a parent or person at least five years older than you ever touch or fondle you or have you touched their body in a sexual way or attempt or actually have oral anal or vaginal intercourse with you and again for some this might be stirring up stuff and you may need to just pause and come back to this later and that's perfectly okay question four did you often or very often feel that no one in your family loved you or thought you were important or special or your family did not look out for each other feel close to each other or support each other question five did you often or very often feel that you did not have enough to eat had to wear dirty clothes and had no one to protect you or your parents were too drunk or high to take care of you or take you to the doctor if you needed it six were your parents ever separated or divorced seven did you live with anyone who was a problem drinker or alcoholic or who use street drugs eight was your mother or stepmother often or very often pushed grabbed slapped or had something thrown at her or sometimes often or very often kicked bitten hit with a fist or hit with something hard or ever repeatedly hit over at least a few minutes or threatened with a gun or knife what I would add to that one is you could also put was your father or stepfather physically abused because we know that happens a lot as well it's not just men abusing women question nine was a household member depressed or mentally ill or did a household member attempt suicide and question ten did a household member go to prison so those are the ace eight ten questions the adverse childhood experiences and there's lots of information about how they would score that based on how many out of the ten you got right I have done another talk on that and given all of that research and scoring information if you want to look at that but I want to move now to the questions that I have added to that that I think would be helpful for people to determine whether or not they have complex trauma or complex PTSD so question eleven did you have a parent who was a workaholic or who was away a lot due to work or travel twelve were you placed in foster care or in the foster care system

age and regularly as you grew up to horror movies so how did you do for some of you that might have been quite eye opening and you might have gone wow I can see a lot of things in my family that were not healthy I again encourage you to look into taking our lift program our react program that will really focus in on helping you become even more aware and begin to learn how to change the tools for a healthy life but for some of you as you listen to that test and went through it it brought up not only your childhood in the home you grew up in but for some of you you were thinking I have done this in my children's life I have done these things that are not healthy and you have gone to a place of tremendous guilt and the question is have I screwed up my kids have I put them in a place where they are going to have their own complex trauma and it's going to really mess them up well they may have their own complex trauma but it does not mean there's no hope what children need in order to deal with their own wounds their own complex trauma is a mom and dad who are dealing with their stuff and when they see mom and dad growing and changing having different attitudes and different responses to what is happening then they are going to feel safer they are going to feel that they can now talk to mom and dad about some of the stuff that they are going through and you can help them deal with their wounds so that's the end of part one we are going to take a short break and then we will have the Christian part if that is not of interest to you that's okay we do not want anybody to feel pressured to sit through the second part but for everybody else we will be back in just about a minute well welcome back we have been looking at the life of Joseph in the Bible and he's of all the Bible characters he's the one that we have the greatest documentation or record of the trauma that he went through and where we are at in the story is that Joseph has been in prison on false charges he's experienced great injustice he was accused of rape when he did not do it and he's been thrown in prison without any chance of having a just trial it looks like he's going to spend the rest of his life there but then there's been two prisoners that have come in to prison while he's there Ferrell's cup bearer and his baker the two close people to Ferrell who are testing his food and drink and there's been an assassination attempt on the life of Ferrell and so cup bearer baker suspects in prison while they are in prison both of them have a dream and Joseph instead of saying oh do not trust dreams I did that once and it never has happened he shows he's still believing that God's about his dream I am going to give it to him which is amazing but he says to the cup bearer in the baker tell me your dreams God gives interpretations to dreams so they tell him and he says well baker this shows that you are the guilty one of the assassination and you are going to be found out and put the death cup bearer you are going to be restored to your position and the cup bearer is so grateful and thankful and Joseph says when you get restored to your position next to Ferrell would you please tell him about my situation my unjust imprisonment and the cup bearer promises I will I am so grateful Joseph I will tell Ferrell you will be out of here in no time so that leads us to today and here's what it says Ferrell's chief cup bearer however forgot all about Joseph never giving him another thought so I want you to just picture cup bears released from prison the next morning Joseph wakes up gets dressed sits on the edge of his bed expecting somebody's going to show up from Ferrell's court room and say Joseph you are wanted by Ferrell he wants to talk to you he waits all day nothing happens it just feels like a kick in the gut and then maybe he says well maybe the cup bearer is just so busy on his first day back on the job he did not have time to talk to Ferrell so the next morning he wakes up again waits all day no messenger shows up third day no messenger shows up you can just feel the pain that Joseph would be going through he got his hopes up again and now he's all excited and expectant and nothing's happening and his hopes are getting dashed over and over and over again and you can imagine after two weeks he just is like oh man he forgot all about me and he was my only chance to get out of prison do you imagine how let down he would feel how confused how disappointed how hurt how angry how betrayed he would have felt but can you also imagine that his hope would just be crushed again because now it was looking like he was going to be in prison forever the cup bearer had forgotten all about him now what what other opportunity did he have to get his case heard and have a chance of justice just crushing and I can just imagine Joseph struggling or sinking into a deep depression despondency but here's what I want you to get we are told that two more years pass and nothing happens two more years of waking up every day in prison with no chance of escape and nothing from the cup bearer or anybody else two years of sitting in this deep despondency and feeling of hopelessness I think this was a dark dark night for Joseph Saul what do I want you to take away from this people from complex trauma know all about getting your hopes up to have them crushed and many get to the point where they just say I am never going to get my hopes up again that is always tricky territory but to say I am never going to get my hopes up again means I sabotage every good thing that comes along just so I do not get my hopes up but Joseph God is hopes up again and the crush of all of that but secondly what I want you to understand is that the people will let us down at times even well intentioned people that's part of life that's part of what we have to deal with as we recover not everybody's going to treat us perfectly even people that make promises to us can let us down and that hurts a lot and it can do a lot of damage for people with complex trauma but more than that what I want you to realize is that following God like Joseph was doing does not mean an easy life it does not mean God just magically fixes all your problems quickly that everything goes smoothly it can be years of sitting in a prison of where you have been treated unjustly and nobody's hearing your case following God can be very painful at times but then the next thing with that I want you to see is there are times when we have to sit in painful times with no way to resolve it no way to fix it we can look for resolution we can even look for quick fixes magic bullets and they are not available and sometimes in recovery life just means we have to sit in a painful dark period for an unknown period of time and that is very difficult but let me give you a final thing do you realize that though it felt like God had failed Joseph though it felt like God had let Joseph down and forgotten about Joseph and it looked like God was never going to fulfill the promise he made to Joseph in his dreams to make him great God had not forgotten Joseph so just because he was in a two-year dark period and it looked like God had forgotten him God had not and God was just about to fulfill these promises to Joseph so Joseph's darkest night came right before his greatest triumphs and that's what we are going to look at next time let's just pray Father again I am just so thankful for the lessons we learned from the life of Joseph and I pray that you would use it to strengthen and encourage people who are going through similar times and just help them to hang on to that God has not forgotten them Amen Well that's the end of our Friday night Thank you so much for being here I hope taking the test was helpful for you We will see you next Friday have a great weekend.
