## Current Focus
Business Strategy Expansion & CMS System development while maintaining synchronized memory systems and clinical platform stability.

## What Changed Recently (December 2025)
- **Business Strategy Project**: New initiative launched with comprehensive requirements analysis and system architecture
- **Memory Bank**: Fully synchronized - `.memory/` authoritative files updated and `memory-bank/` secondary system aligned
- **Repository Status**: Clean working tree with proper exclusions for large artifacts

## Memory System Status
- **Primary**: `.memory/` (00-70 files) - ✅ Updated and current
- **Secondary**: `memory-bank/` - ✅ Synchronized with primary
- **Sync Protocol**: Automated updates triggered on significant changes

## Operational Rules

- Separate security models for business vs clinical systems

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete Business Strategy project infrastructure setup
2. Implement database schema for business intelligence
3. Build authentication system for business CMS
4. Continue background optimization of clinical platform
5. Monitor memory system synchronization automatically

## Technical Context
