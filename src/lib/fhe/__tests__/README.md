# FHE (Fully Homomorphic Encryption) Tests

This directory contains tests for the FHE module.

## What is being tested

- Basic encryption and decryption operations
- Sender verification functionality
- Processing of encrypted data

## Mock Implementation

The FHE module uses a simplified mock implementation for testing purposes.
In a production environment, this would be replaced with a real FHE library implementation.

## Test structure

- Unit tests for individual functions
- Integration tests for the complete FHE system
