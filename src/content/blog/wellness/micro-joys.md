# The Art of Micro-Joys: Finding Happiness in Small Moments

## Introduction

In our quest for happiness, we often overlook the tiny moments of joy that pepper our daily lives. These "micro-joys" – small, seemingly insignificant moments of pleasure or contentment – can be powerful tools for building lasting happiness and resilience. Let's explore how to notice, appreciate, and cultivate these precious moments.
