That can happen.  That makes them anger.  And they do not just respond a little bit.  They respond in full activation mode.  They flip.  So the response.  Does not match.  The trigger.  And that's what many of you.  Are now realizing.  That you can be going through a day.  And all it takes is the tiniest little thing.  That annoys you.  And you lose it.  And you go into very.  Dangerous places with dangerous behavior.  Next thing I want you to think about with complex trauma.  Is that you are in a situation.  You can understand how people respond.  In an unsafe environment.  Gaults trauma.  Many children from complex trauma.  Live with the frustration.  That nobody ever heard them.  They tried to express themselves.  They hope their parents.  Wanted to get them.  And they tried hard to engage them.  In conversation.  To talk about their world.  And how they see the world.  Get heard was to get angry.  And that became a big thing for them was I got to blow up before anybody will listen to me.  So anger became a necessary thing to try to get your needs met and to get heard.  Next thing is what we said about anger.  And so what I want you to see is, do you see that anger's original design was to pull you in a positive direction?  It was to get you to fix love violations and return relationships to healthy.

Now, anger pulls you in a negative direction.  So you want to know what happens now?  You get angry, you want to hurt the people in your relationship.  You want to destroy further the relationship.  So it pulls you in the opposite direction.  It pulls you to do more unloving things rather than more loving things.  That is where the damage comes.

Now, one of the things that I ask clients all the time to be aware of is this.  What is your emotional default setting?  And what I mean by that is, if you are not working on yourself, where do you end up emotionally?  So a lot of people, when they think about that, they go, if I am not doing work on myself and not aware of myself, I end up depressed, full of anxiety and anger.  And I am dead inside otherwise.  So anger, for most people out of complex trauma, is their default setting.  That's where you will gravitate towards if you are not working on yourself.  So the final piece that I want you to see here is I think the greatest way to understand complex trauma is to understand the way in which you are working on yourself.  The first one is that complex trauma's greatest damage is to your identity.  And we call it shame.  So instead of seeing yourself as valuable and a loving, valuable person, you see yourself as not valuable, not lovable.  Your identity, instead of being positive, becomes negative.  And so one way to understand shame is that as shame builds in your life, it requires you to be angry at yourself.  Because you do not like that you are unlovable.  You hate that you do not have any value for who you are.  Or at least that's what you think.  Though that is not true.

But that's what you think is true.  And so your anger naturally turns inward because of shame and complex trauma.  So what I do with clients all the time is I put on the board, who are the people that you have been angry with?  So they will start with partner, parents, family, friends.  Then they will go to authorities.  Cops, bosses, CFS, etc.  Then that will go to God.  He's the ultimate authority.  And then it will go to self.  And then they begin to realize, I am basically mad at everything.  That's what my world has become.  I am mad at me, I am mad at the world.  And everything in it.  And that is a very sad place to live.  So that's where the lack of self-love comes in.  Now let me take one more piece for tonight.  Kids growing up in complex trauma, when they begin to realize everybody's angry, but nobody's using it to create loving relationships, to fix problems, they start taking notes on other uses of anger.  And they begin to adopt those uses in their own life.  Because they find that anger is an amazing way to create love and to create peace.  And that anger is an amazing shield, and an amazing weapon.  It enables them to accomplish a lot of things that they normally would not be able to accomplish.  So quickly, let me give you some of the misuses of anger that develop within complex trauma that probably you have picked up.  So some of these you can check off.  And if you check off all of them, you need to come to the rest of the sessions.  So number one, many realize that when you come up in complex trauma, you have a lot of anger, but you are afraid of angry people.  They scare you.  So you go, if I want to manipulate people, I should get angry.  And they are going to be afraid of me.  And they are going to give me whatever I want.  They are going to say, just do whatever you want.  Just do not be angry.  And you have won.  And so that can go even further.  Anger is not just good for manipulation.  Through intimidation, it's good for control.  So many families of complex trauma, the thing that kept the kids somewhat in line was not that they were loved.  It was they are afraid of dad's anger.  So fear of anger becomes a control technique.  Then you realize anger is also like a medication.  When I am feeling angry, I am not feeling pain.  When I am feeling pain, when I am feeling angry, I am not feeling my hurt.  So if I get angry, I want to quickly go to, or if I get hurt and in emotional pain, I quickly want to go to anger because that shuts everything else down.  And I do not feel those other emotions.  Take that a little bit further.  What happens for a lot of people is that they realize early on that there's certain characteristics or emotions that are causing them to feel hurt.  And that's the thing that gets them to feel hurt.  Because it's not just about anger.  It's about the fact that they are not feeling pain.  It's about the fact that they are not feeling pain.  It's about the fact that they are not feeling pain.  It's about the fact that they are not feeling pain.  So if I show embarrassment, or if I show fear, I get laughed at and picked on.  So what you learn to do, as soon as you feel embarrassment, you quickly switch to anger.  So I would suspect, and I ask clients this all the time at REACT, how many of you, when you are embarrassed, within two seconds you are angry?  And almost everybody puts their hand up.  Because you have learned to cover, weak emotions with anger so that you do not feel it.  Next, for many people growing up in complex trauma, healthy boundaries were not in existence.  So you said no to your parents and they did not care.  They just still did what they want.  They came into your room, etc.  So what children learn, or just again know inherently, intrinsically, is I need space.

But nobody's giving me space.  So how do I create it?  Isolate.  Well, in a family with people that do not let you isolate, that does not work.  So option two, explode.  So anger becomes the way of creating boundaries.  And the problem with that is that once you get angry, then you feel guilty afterwards.  And then you say, sorry, everybody come back in my room and walk all over me.  And then you get so tired of that again, you explode again.  And you start this yo-yo effect where you are trying to create a boundary, but then taking it down.  Next one, anger is a great way to hurt people that have hurt us.  And so it becomes a weapon.  Next one, anger gives us energy.  I sometimes ask people, how many of you like to get angry before you clean the house?  And they say yes, because now I clean the house and I do a great job.  Because I am angry.

And so, when you get angry, anger gives you energy.  Some people get angry in the morning if they are feeling a bit flat or down or low energy, because that gets them going.  So it has a purpose there.  Others want to stay angry because it keeps their edge.  It keeps them sharp.  It keeps them alert to danger, to jerks out there.  And their fear is if I let my anger die, I might get hurt.  I might drop my guard too much.  And it's a bad example.  Next one, have you ever noticed when you are angry, you are never wrong in your own eyes?  When you are angry, everybody else is wrong and you are Jesus.  You are so right.  You become Little Miss, self-righteous, whatever.  So what happens with anger?  And one of the reasons we like it is because it not allows me to blame everybody else for my problems.  And it keeps me from everything else.  I am not angry because I have the strength to be angry.  I am not angry because I have the strength to be angry.  I have the strength to be angry.  I am not angry because I am angry.  Ever having to look at myself honestly.  And it creates a feeling that I am in the right and you are in the wrong, which gives that self-righteous justice feeling.  So again, another purpose for anger.  Many or most or maybe all of people that have complex trauma who have not been able to resolve it have reached a point where they go, how do I not get hurt by this person anymore?  So their only way to not get hurt is to close their heart shut to that other person.

But then the question is, what do I need to enable me to want to close my heart and keep it shut?  Turn my anger into a resentment.  Because once it's a resentment, I have no trouble closing it.  I am closing my heart.  And so again, it's a self-protective shield that many people use in order to protect their heart.  Another one for many people is it's your identity.  I have had clients say that when they were young or in the problem, they were respected because everybody feared their anger.  That became their identity.  It's what gave them value, prestige, power.  And they said, if I let my anger go, who am I?  Am I going to end up being a weakling, a softie?  I do not know if I can endure that.  So that's another purpose.  We already talked about it's a way of avoiding looking at yourself.  You are always focused on how everybody else has done you wrong.  And for many people, that leads to, I do not need help.  I am not going to reach out for help.  Everybody else needs help, but I do not.  Anger allows you to justify that kind of feeling.  So that was quite a few things.  I do not know how many you checked.  Maybe you were afraid to start that exercise.  That was an introduction to anger.  So if you know me at all, you know that next week, we are going to take it a little deeper.  And you are going to get a little bit more self-awareness, which might be, more pain and more anger at Kim.

But that's the end of part one.  We are going to have Kim come back and sing a couple songs.  Then we are going to go to the Christian part.  If you are not interested in the Christian part, you are free to go.  Thank you for coming.  Nobody's going to give you a hard time for that at all.  We respect your wishes totally.  Well, I thought for the Christian part tonight, I would give you, what does the Bible, say about anger?  And I think part of why I want to talk about that is I think if I was to interview all of you, there would be a lot of you that would think the Bible says anger's wrong, anger's a sin, all of those kinds of things that, because that's often what is taught today by a lot of churches.  And so there's a lot of misunderstanding about anger.  So I want to take you mainly the book of Proverbs, which is becoming kind of the wisdom of Solomon guide that we go to for stuff.  And I want to show you what he says, but I want to start in the New Testament, the book of Ephesians.  It says this, in your anger, do not sin.

Now, here's what I want you to see from that.  He is not saying if you are angry, you are sinning.  He's saying that it's possible to be angry and not do anything wrong.  So there's anger that is wrong and there's anger that is not wrong.  He's making that very clear.  So what he is saying is this, anger is a powerful emotion.  And if you had a crappy childhood, it's going to make you want to do wrong.  You can get angry.  Just learn how to do right with that anger.  Then he says in verse 27, anger gives the devil a foothold.  And I think what I want you to hear and what he's getting at with that is anger.  And what he's getting at is this, if you have unresolved anger inside of you, it takes you to a darker and a darker place.  It begins to open the door to other behaviors, other thoughts, revenge thoughts, acting out thoughts that could take you to an even worse place.  So he is saying, be very careful of anger because if you hang on to anger, you open yourself up to negativity.  And if you hang on to anger, you open yourself up to negative forces that you were not expecting.  And they can take you to worse places.  And then in verse 32, so this is all in the last few verses of this chapter, get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander.  So what he, the word he's using for anger is again that lashing out on cruel anger.  And he is saying, you should be the type of person who is not harsh or saying hurtful things, but they are marked by a love that people take notice of.  So make that your goal.  Then in James, and James is considered to be the Proverbs of the New Testament, wisdom stuff, he says this, understand this, my dear brothers and sisters, you must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get anger.  Now what is it that most of us, most of us do?  We are quick to speak, quick to get angry, and slow to listen.  So he says, let's reverse that.  Let's start with being quick to listen.  And if you are quick to listen, all of a sudden, your anger is going to be less, your speech is going to be a lot better, because you are not going to say a lot of hurtful things.  So the starting point is to start listening more than letting your anger make you act out.  So again, he then adds this, human anger does not produce the righteousness God desires.  So what we said in the first part is this, the original design by God of anger was that, was take you to the righteousness God desires.

But what he's saying is human anger takes you to the opposite place.  And you need to be very aware that your anger can either be good anger or bad, and watch out for the bad.  Okay, now let me take you to Proverbs.  And I love this, because again, what you are going to see is that Solomon in writing Proverbs had this amazing insight into human nature and into anger.  So I am going to give you a whole slew of verses.  You can just follow on.  I will comment as we go to make sure you kind of understand the pieces of what he is saying.

But he says, first of all, in chapter 29, Fools vent their anger, wise people quietly hold it back.  What he is saying there is, what he is saying this is not that wise people stuff their anger, but wise people learn how to regulate and manage their anger.  Fools do not.  They just let it out.  And they do not care who gets hurt with the shotgun blast of their anger.  Then in chapter 19, sensible people control their temper.  So again, it's all about emotional regulation.  That wisdom brings with it the ability to manage powerful emotions.  And anger is one of the most powerful, if not the most powerful emotion.  So you do not get real good wisdom until you learn how to manage that powerful emotion called anger.  So if you do, you earn respect for managing that.

But with that, you learn to pick your battles wisely.  And you learn to overlook some things that are not really a big deal.  Whereas an angry person, they get angry about every little thing.  And they do not overlook anything because everything accelerates their anger.  So a wise person learns what to get angry about, and then to manage their anger.  And then in chapter 16, He who is slow to anger is better than the mighty.  And he who rules his spirit is better than he who takes the city.  So what he is describing is mighty soldiers.  An army that are able to swoop in with great power and conquer a city.  And what he is saying is if you can control anger, you are actually stronger than those men.  They have got physical strength.

But a person who can control their anger has an emotional strength.  That exceeds any type of physical strength.  So that is what your goal should be.  That is what makes you truly great.  Not physical strength.  And then this one is very important for people from complex trauma to think about.  Chapter 22.  Do not befriend angry people.  In other words, put boundaries up.  Why?  Or next one.  Do not associate with hot-tempered people.  Or you will learn to be like them.  In other words, you hang around angry people, it's going to rub off.  It's going to influence you.

But then it goes further.  You are going to not just learn to be like them.  You endanger your soul.  Because once you start going down that road and following these angry people, you are going to do things that hurt others and hurt yourself and hurt your soul.  So anger has soul-destroying qualities.

But hanging around angry people puts you in danger of having that happen to you.  So one purpose for boundaries has to be boundaries with angry people.  Because of the damage that they can do.  Next one.  A hot-tempered person starts fights.  A cool-tempered person stops them.  Not by stuffing everything and saying, We are done.  We are not talking about it.

But by resolving them.  So in other words, Do you want to be a person that just starts fights and leaves everything unresolved so that it just builds this pile of resentments?  Or do you want to be a person that knows how to resolve stuff so there's less anger around?  And then the next one.  People with understanding control their anger.  A hot-tempered shows great foolishness.  Now I told you before that in the book of Proverbs, when it talks about a foolish person, he's talking about a person who lives out of their limbic brain.  And guess what anger, what part of the brain anger is all about?  Your limbic brain.  And anger fires up your limbic brain more powerfully than any other emotion.  And so what he is saying is the greatest fools are those who live out of their limbic brain.  And the greatest fools are those who live out of an angry limbic brain.  So a wise person, in the book of Proverbs, is a cortex person.  So the cortex trumps the limbic part.  A fool, the limbic trumps the cortex.  So I act out my feelings whether they are hurtful or not.  Cortex trumps limbic says, I am angry but I am going to figure out why and I am going to manage how I express it.  So that it's productive and it brings resolution.  So a wise person is from the cortex and he's going to be able to do that.  And that controls the limbic part.

But then he goes further.  Not only do they show great foolishness, a peaceful heart or not angry person leads to a healthy body.  Jealousy is like cancer in the bones.  So he picks jealousy because it's the greatest form of anger.

But what he is saying is anger messes up your health.  So that was in the Bible long before scientists figured it out.  So what does that mean?  It means that anger affects your physical health.  Number four, or next one, chapter 14.  Short tempered people do foolish things.  Schemers are hated.  The point is this.  If you give in to your temper, you always regret it.  Because you do stuff that you go, what was I thinking?  What a fool I am.  And you regret it.  And then people do not want to be around you.  Lack of respect for you.  And they begin to hate you.  And then the next one.  Better a dry crust eaten in peace in a house filled with feasting and conflict.  And then I got to give you the next one.  Better to dwell in the corner of a house top than in a house shared with a contentious angry person.  In other words, you are better to make a little tent on the roof and live there than live in a great big 4,000 square foot house with an angry person.  That's how difficult life becomes when you live with that person.  And it affects you.  And then it's better to have poverty, a dry crust, but have peace in the home, than to have great wealth and nothing but anger.  So he's making these beautiful contrasts that say, money is not what gives you the greatest sense of success.  It's peace which is controlling anger.  If you get that, then you are going to have the family you always wanted.  Then you are going to have the respect that you have been wanting.  Then you are going to be the person that is capable of healthy relationships.  So if something is more valuable than money and possessions, it's controlling your emotions in a healthy way.  Next one.  If someone has a hot temper, let them take the consequences.  If you get him out of trouble once, you will have to do it again.  Two things I want you to see there.  What he is saying is, angry people, after they are angry, say, I am sorry, I am sorry, I will never do it again.

But if they do not deal with it, they are going to do it again.  They are not going to learn from it.  Because anger, the next time it's triggered, is going to pull them so quickly in that negative direction, they cannot stop it.  So then what he says is, do not clean up after them.  If they do something really stupid, do not lie about it.  Do not cover it.  Do not try to take their consequences away.  Because the only thing that will make them be willing to look at their anger and deal with their anger is painful consequences.  So do not be cleaning up after angry people.  You are only putting yourself into a spot where you are going to do it again and again and again.  An angry person starts fights.  A hot tempered person commits all kinds of sins.  In other words, anger is an emotion that leads to all kinds of bad things.  So it's not just the anger that's the issue.  It's all the things that get done while you are angry that are hard to stop and you cannot take back and do all the damage.  Ecclesiastes, which is about Solomon, we talked about, it says, control your temper for anger labor.  It enables you a fool.  Have you ever seen an angry person acting out and you roll your eyes and go, how childish.  How immature.  Okay, very quickly, causes of anger that are given in the Bible.  Proverbs, Solomon says, pride leads to conflict.  Those who take advice are wise.  So what he's saying by pride is the person who thinks they are always right and always be in conflict.  Because they are never willing to look at their own stuff.  In their mind it's always everybody else's fault.  So nothing will get resolved so there will always be conflict.  Secondly, a proud person, you cannot teach anything.  So they are never going to want to look at themselves honestly.  So they are always going to have conflict.  Next thing, pride people always put their needs and their desires and their wishes ahead of everybody else.  So pride makes you inherently selfish.  I want my way more than your way.  I demand my way.  And when you get a person with that kind of pride, they are always in conflict because they got to step on people to get what they want.  They got to use people to get what they want.  And they create hurt and conflict.  So pride leads to lots of anger.  Next one, James 4 says, what is causing the quarrels and fights among you?  Do they come from, do not they come from the evil desires at war within you?  Then he explains it.  You want what you do not have.  So you go, my neighbor got a new car.  I want a new car.  My new kid got a brand new iPhone.  I want a new iPhone.  And you become consumed with that.  So you want what you do not have.  So you scheme and kill to get it.  You are jealous of what others have, but you cannot get it.  So you fight and wage war to take away from them.  So envy, selfish desires, always comparing myself to what others have, leads to anger.  And then there's also in there, it says there's evil desires at war within you.  Part of you when you are having anger going on is because you are discontent inside.  You are just not happy.  You are not at peace.  Part of you wants to relapse.  Part of you wants to stay clean.  Part of you wants to act out.  Part of you wants to get healthy.  Part of you just wants to give up, quit, not think about anything, and medicate everything.  Part of you wants to start getting real.  And you are conflicted.  And then you go to this very dead place because it just feels familiar.  And that leads to anger.  That internal fighting that happens inside of us.  Next one.  A gentle answer, usually deflects anger.  So somebody lashes out at you, if you lash back, the anger just escalates.  If you respond with a gentle answer, often they will calm down a little bit.  Okay?

But then it says harsh words make tempers flare.  And what is involved in harsh words?  Disrespect voiced.  How do you trigger a person from complex trauma?  You do the things that violated love, when they were children.  You lie to them, cheat on them, not fair, injustice, and you disrespect them.  Those are their four main hottest buttons triggers.  And so what Solomon is saying is this.  If you want to get anger flaring, just start disrespecting everybody.  And that will lead to a very angry household.  Next one.  Jealousy.  And what I said earlier, and Solomon shows in Proverbs, that probably the greatest cause, or trigger of anger, that takes us to the most severe height, is jealousy.  So he said, anger is cruel and fury is overwhelming.  In other words, he's saying, anger is massive.  It is the greatest, most intense emotion, but who can stand before jealousy?  In other words, it just takes it up one more notch.  So jealousy takes anger to the highest level.  And then, jealousy arouses a husband's fury, and he will show no mercy when it comes to revenge.  Jealousy can make you act out in super destructive ways.  Now the problem with complex trauma is a lot of jealousy, you want to say the other person is cheating on you, but they are not.  It's your own shame.  And you are just convinced that if they get to know you, they are going to leave you and find somebody else.  So your jealousy, is not based in reality, it's based in the distortions of beliefs that come out of your shame.  And so that is something to be working on, because if you do not, you are going to be getting jealous all the time, and each time you do, you are doing damage.  And pretty soon the relationship will not be able to recover from it.  And then the final one, gossip.  As surely as a north wind brings rain, it's going to rain.  And so in Israeli climate, if the north wind was blowing, it was going to rain.  You could count on it.  It was a definite given.  So a gossiping tongue, what can you count on?  Anger will follow.  Just like a north wind, rain follows, gossip, anger follows.  You start telling stuff to other people that you should be keeping to yourself, you talk behind people's backs, you are going to have angry people.  So that's just five.  Over the next weeks, we are going to look at a lot more triggers of anger.

But I thought for tonight, I would give you a taste of the insight the Bible has into why we get angry, what we need to be aware when it comes to looking at our anger, and beginning to create in us a deeper commitment to deal with this issue in our lives.  Let's pray.  Father, it's an area that most of us have had times or still have times that this anger is a huge problem and it does so much damage.  And I just pray that in this series you would help each person to grow in learning to manage their anger and learning to have their cortex brain trump their limbic brain.  Amen.  Okay, that is our evening.  Thank you for all who joined us online, and thank you for everybody who came tonight.  We will see you next Friday.
