Design and implement MCP (Management Control Panel) server for agent interaction endpoints. This is Phase 6 of the TechDeck-Python pipeline integration project.

The MCP server should provide:

Agent registration and discovery endpoints
Task delegation and status tracking
Pipeline orchestration for the 6-stage process
Integration with existing Flask API service
WebSocket support for real-time agent communication
Authentication and authorization for agent access
Error handling and retry mechanisms
Monitoring and logging capabilities
Follow the existing project patterns and ensure compatibility with the current Flask service architecture. The MCP server should expose RESTful endpoints and WebSocket connections for agent interactions.

Design MCP server architecture and API endpoints
Implement agent registration and discovery system
Create task delegation and status tracking mechanisms
Build pipeline orchestration for the 6-stage process
Implement authentication and authorization for agent access
Add error handling and retry mechanisms
Create monitoring and logging capabilities
Write comprehensive tests
Document MCP server API and integration points
