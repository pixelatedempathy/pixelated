Welcome, nice to have you all here. Today we are here and Uwe would like to celebrate his 60th birthday. And that is also a wish that we can fulfill for him. And there is a small table of memories built up inside. And I am totally looking forward to many, many nice conversations and nice hours with you here. To Uwe! My name is Claudia and my beloved husband Uwe died a few weeks ago, shortly before his 60th birthday, at ALS. Happy birthday! Uwe wanted to celebrate his 60th birthday. Instead, last year we celebrated his 59th birthday with him, which was incredibly beautiful. It was quite special how we were together and what kind of connection and how much love there was in the room. But also this knowledge all the time that this is the last time. That I will not regret it. Uwe´s illness is incurable. He wants to determine for himself how long he can live with it. He asks us to accompany him and his wife Claudia with the camera in the last few months. Of course, at the age of 50, you live in the assumption that a lot will come. And that you can still plan things and do them and experience them together. And that you can still live together. He was a rock in the fire in the beginning because he had this calmness and clarity from the beginning. And that he says, yes, it is so. The disease is so. We cried then. How unfair is that? I said to him, we still wanted to get old together. It can't be. One, two, three. Hold, hold, hold. Yes, horizon. I am Uwe. I am 59 years old. I have amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, short ALS. This means that the nerves responsible for muscle control die. And if a muscle no longer receives signals, then he says, okay, then I'll just get rid of myself if I don't need to. And that happened then bit by bit on the left side. So that at some point I couldn't use my hand anymore. And then the arm. Is the video already on? And now I would like to ... That you push against my fingers and try to take your hand apart. That nothing is transmitted by force. So there is ... I'll tell you, nothing at all. And now please do it together. Try to close your fingers. And as you can see, the hand goes down. For me it is very, very fast. My doctor, as I said, is a normal ALS patient. He is on the road with 80 to 100 km h. They are currently on the road with 240 km h. And yes, the illness goes pretty fast. And you might already hear it on the tongue. There is already a little muscle degeneration. And that's why I speak the way I speak. Yes, I speak the way I speak. I speak the way I speak. I speak the way I speak. When the diagnosis came, when Uwe told me that, it was really like the floor under the feet pulled away. It was like a black hole. It was just terrible. To have a disease where you know it will never get any better. Others say, do you do a treatment or something? Well, then it will get better again. But it won't get better. And you can't say anything. Every day you can still say, oh, how nice that it's still going today. Yes. That's just ... that's just hard. Yes. And also the ... I mean, there were of course moments, I have to say, and we are open to that, where moments where we get angry, where there is no patience left, where he is totally impatient. I do it wrong and I think, then say it right. And I'm sometimes so angry. Yes. And I think, oh my God, how long ... I want my life back. I want my life back. But ... yes, and on the other hand, I'm so sorry. Of course, it's all very burdensome. And as long as I, let's say, am still so mobile, friends help me, to participate in all this, yes, for so long I think life is very ... even if it's difficult. Yes. And if I can't do that anymore, because I'm completely motionless and I can't express myself verbally anymore, then for me that's the point to go. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm working as a trainer and coach in a large international company. But now I'm there for Uwe. I'm sitting in my work. At work ... I mean, I can work in my home office, that you still have a certain structure there and the feeling there is still a little bit of old life. Yes. Yes. Okay, chair is coming. So is Türen. I wanted to continue to work after somewho was there. Hey Siri,� cleave out he flight mode . For me there was no way to get both sick and to hide my head in the sand. I'm working for a children's and juvenile alchemy book association with a head bed in Nuremberg, , and I was there for the caretakers there. I was responsible for the sales of books in Northeast Germany. It's terrible when you get such a diagnosis, when you know that life is limited and you know how much time is left. But at least we tried to use the time to do nice things. Somehow you had the feeling that you had bought something from fate. Now we hope that the wind will be a little bit more gentle so that we can start, otherwise we will be torn apart. Uwe had the great desire to fly paragliding again. Uwe had such a flair for flying and he flew paragliding as a young man. And he wanted to do that. And then I gave Uwe this flight for his birthday. And then they flew off and that was just fantastic. And the whole week we waited for the chance to do it with you. And now it worked. I am very happy for you. Thank you very much. You are welcome. No pain. How can you sleep tonight? Well, I tried to move back and forth again. And I had a bigger dose of medication than I have today, again, besides the fight. The progress of the disease is of course a challenge. When you are in physiotherapy and then you hear, oh, your shoulder muscles are almost no longer there. That's difficult. Okay. It works. Pain? Yes, slightly in the elbow and it really feels like you're, yes, it sounds maybe harsh now, but it really feels like you're in a state of shock. Maybe it's because of the fact that you're being casted in so slowly and you're just motionless. The nights, that was because he couldn't turn himself anymore. Then I had to get up four, five, six times a night and turn him. And then I noticed how I was totally unconcentrated due to this lack of sleep, also badly in a bad mood, impatient. And I also developed gyposis. And that was also such a sign for me that the body also says, it's good, watch out. Yes. Because of the burden, but also that I don't want to die at home, I've decided for a long time to go to hospice. That's easy. And it's just very short-term everything came. And psychologically it's just totally ambivalent, but of course it's also sad. Yes. Well, you know, it's all a farewell to the advice. So for him it's a farewell to the advice of skills that he has. And you go yourself, exactly, so with a longing eye, somehow. Yes. Exactly. In the death or in the separation, yes. That's about it for the first time. The cables are still missing. Medicaments. Culture bags. And Uwe. And Uwe. Okay. Then let's get going, huh? 18 months after the diagnosis, the two of them are no longer at home. Uwe will now live in the Simeon Hospice in Berlin-Spandau. He has to go to the hospital in Berlin. Of course it was a huge step because to leave the familiar, home environment and also to escape from it, because you can only go there as a guest and then I lived in the hospital was of course a very nice interruption. It often doesn't stay that long to take care of the food. Uwe has been in the hospital for three or four weeks now and that is of course a big relief. That's nice, although at the beginning I made accusations that I didn't last longer. Then I thought, okay, I've given up on him and maybe I should have been better, I should have been more patient, then it would have gone a little longer. When I drive into the hospital, of course, it is always fun that I can finally see Uwe again, but there is always a caldron in my throat. Now that I think about it, how do I feel about him today? How is it today? I have always thought, you are going to the hospital to die. They also told us that a hospital is there to escape the stress of someone being so hard to take care of, so someone at home won't get sick, or can't speak to the doctor and he is not able to have him for a time that he will be designed for, or someone will be determined to do as he needs to because he doesn't have enough and no one else can be that important to the patient, when his death is not necessarily right before him. And he feels totally at ease and is also very well taken care of. Let's see, now I have our homemade cookies. I baked them with Claire, well, mostly Claire, but we baked them last weekend. Uwe likes to eat cookies. I love cookies. I'm not alone. I also have help from volunteer helpers, from the Ambulance Hospital, from my three adult children, but of course also from very dear friends who are there. Hello, Uwe. Hey, Sabrina. Hi, how are you? Oh, I'm cold. Hello, Rosalie. Hello. Nice to meet you. Likewise, you are ... My bonus to you is that I have a lot of friends who are very close to me. Well, that's good. The bonus daughter. The bonus daughter? Claudia's daughter. Yes. Nice. Wonderful. My name is Sabine Wolfrom and I have been taking care of Uwe for two months as a volunteer assistant. He is an incredibly communicative person, very open. We could speak very openly from the beginning and that makes it easy. Then, of course, he still has his humor. He can only bow down to it. How it works. And yes, I think we had such a thread from the beginning. You don't get along that well either. Yes. The situation is terrible. I can't say otherwise. It's terrible to see how he is doing. It's terrible to see how quickly he loses his independence. It's terrible to see how his mother is doing, how difficult it is for him, how he is also going to health. And ... I can't describe it any other way. It has really changed life completely. Ah ... Ah ... Yes ... Ah! I got cards for Markus Krebs. And now many people have tried to fulfill my wish, because I have always wanted to be a doctor. Yes. I have always wanted to be a doctor. Yes. Yes, my last wish. A good friend of ours, Uwe Chorus from Falkensee, is ill with ALS. I can't pronounce it. He is ill and has a few weeks to live. One of his last wishes is a visit to Markus Krebs' show. That was one of his last wishes. Uwe is a humorous and open person, despite his diagnosis and the fact that he will be here for a short time. Totally cute. Ah ... Ah ... Oh man. The people take care of themselves all so nicely. I am incredibly excited. Laughing and crying at the same time. I am really happy for you that it worked out. It is already quite a beautiful act to come here. I am very happy for you. I am very happy for you. I am very happy for you. I am very happy for you. I am very happy for you. It was a very nice act to come here. This whole organization. Great that the friends were there. Colleagues, you also need a lot of support. Bye. See you later. See you later. See you later, Thorsten. Now I think it's starting to fall apart. Now it's coming true. Now we can just enjoy. We have the drink, we have the pretzels, we have the space, we have us. Yes. Yes. Let's go. Mm. Mm. Mommy. . . . . . It was just gigantic, wasn't it? It was so great. I really have my, almost my voice back. I hear, right? Because you've had enough oxygen. Yes, I have enough oxygen. Yes, exactly. Hello. Hello, Uwe. Hello, Markus. Did you like it a little? Yes. So, you need a medical number, because I have so much oxygen. I'm working on it. Yes. A cap. Yes. Yes, great. I'll just put it on here and then. And Markus will come to you. I'll do it. And then you can put it on. Yes, yes. And then you can put it on. And Markus will come to you. And Markus will come to you. And then you can put it on. And then I'll put it on. And then you can put it on. And then I'll put it on. Oh, so I can take it off. I've already done that once. Then we'll make a good evening. Then we'll make a good evening. I'm overjoyed now, a little bit exhausted, but that's a positive exhaustion. I think Christmas is something like that again. something like that again for uwe a date where he would like to experience where he is happy about it what is again on the horizon originally we had thought that we would celebrate here with uwe at home with my children with his son and family but that doesn't work anymore uwe is a corona sick he is very bad we can't see him for four weeks i am florian i am 28 years old i am the son of uwe my father was very sporty man has done a lot with me there has been a lot for me and if you see someone in this state then that hits you very much in any case i became a father this year in may And my wife and especially this pregnancy and this child that we got together has given me a lot of strength to go through this difficult time. My father and I, and I think we are relatively similar, we were never the great emotional speakers. We show or, I would say, we deal with our emotions more in silence. We didn't really talk much about death, but we tried to approach things a little more with humour. I think it made it easier for us to say goodbye to each other. I will eat and drink less and less, and then completely give up on it, and then, yes, just go on. And, yes, end the suffering. It's a lot of hard work ahead of us now, yes. But on the other hand, it's also nice to know that he will hopefully be released soon. Then I'll come with a sponge now, exactly. Uwe has always said that he would probably start with a death fast from January. And I think that's a good thing. Yes. He's very determined. And he said, I don't want to anymore, I don't want to anymore, I don't feel like it anymore, I want to die. Now? Yes, gladly. That was already bad. Just sitting there in bed and thinking, you're allowed to die, and then thinking at the next moment, what a piece of shit. I want you to live. Yes, I'm not afraid of death. Uwe dies on January 26, three weeks after the start of the death fast. Soon it might be Nuevoאן for him, then, or Pneumi helicopters. I know how Valtteri has been treating his body so far. Question is then, who gave him the Aboriginal blood? N enriched between what he was energized? I do not know. Do you think so? Hopefully you have the baru. The people were wonderfully raised. We await the news of the new day. God is with us in the evening and in the morning. And certainly on every new day. The new day It's been a while since Uwe's funeral. How are you doing? Sometimes I think, now I have all the freedom. But I don't want to have Uwe again. But as he was before, of course. That's something that comes to me a lot now. This... ... processing of the last year. Because it was all so fast. Of course, I also distract myself. I often make phone calls. I talk a lot. Self-care. You have now one and a half years. First of all, you have worked for your Uwe. Also physically. I think you are always at your limits. And you have to fill it up again. I always notice, when everything is too much, I have to get out. That's natural. When the disease started with Uwe, I spent a while with the choir rehearsals. I tried it. I went there again and again. It's important for me to sing here. Because everyone who makes music with others, he simply notices that this connection, this common breathing, and that afterwards the hearts beat in the equine cancer, that it's just beautiful. And that it of course links to something that has always been there, that belonged to my life. This family would then come up extended andencie funneled over the Goog. You wouldn't think it's, I think, steadily coming. In parce it in the end, regret leads door I see. You say," Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh. Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh. It feels like you've lost that power, and I guess it's my fault. Over my head I don't care if we're together Over my head When the partner dies, the whole identity changes. You're no longer a couple, you're no longer the wife of. The whole planning of life was always, it's a we. And that's all for me now alone. It's a whole new identity, I haven't gotten there yet. When I look at the pictures, there are beautiful memories that come to mind. And a lot of gratitude that we were able to experience this last year. How is it going for you? For me, I don't want to live my life alone. In any case, I would love to come back again, to fall in love again. But Uwe will always stay in my life, in my heart. It will always stay that way. And yes, it just belongs to it. Many times, you've often looked back and said, Oh, she on earth is far too little so I can't show her. And she's not right now. And then, tomorrow is coming else. Does anybody have a personal story you want to share with us? I love her so much.... I like her so much like crying in tears. And she should becomeисb elle kendra7
