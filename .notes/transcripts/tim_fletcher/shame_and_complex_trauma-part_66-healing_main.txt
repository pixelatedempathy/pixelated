So welcome again.

Tonight we're coming, believe it or not, to our last talk on shame.

And it is all going to be positive this week.

It's going to be healing shame.

And last week we started healing shame and it was actually kind of painful, but it was part of the healing process is the self-awareness.

So let me begin by saying this.

One of the questions that I get asked all the time when people start realizing what shame is, is they ask me, am I ever going to get over this?

Will I ever heal from shame?

And what they're hoping I'll do is say, yes, on this date in 2020, you will be over your shame.

And what they are really realizing though, as they get to understand shame is how deeply rooted it is, how much it affects every part of their life.

And so they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame.

And so they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame.

And so they begin to realize there's going to be a lot of shame.

And so they will start to realize where they live.

And so the other thing that I'm hearing asking is how solid is this relationship that you and I are going to see, those processes, those events, those conversations.

And so those experiences that you and I are going to see, those conversations has a lot of meaning.

There's this sort of emotionalization or emotion about the world overwhelmed with the kind of pain that we're experiencing, STUDYahon.

Food is proud of.

I'm going to have wonderful ë°© conducting a And then if you're healing, the triggers become less intense, and then you're able to process through them more quickly.

So currently it could be that once your shame is triggered, you're wiped out for two days in your head and in all your dark places.

As you heal and grow, you can begin to work through stuff in five minutes, an hour, and you become kind of amazed at how quickly you get through stuff.

So it is possible to make lots of healing steps forward, but probably the journey will go on at some level, to some degree, for the rest of your life.

But I don't want that to be discouraging, because as you start to feel the healing, you'll be surprised at how much better you feel overall.

So you will begin to experience benefits very quickly as you start to feel the healing.

And then you'll finally begin to deal with it.

Part of what determines how long the journey is going to be is how much shame is there in your life, number one, how many triggers do you have, and how safe are your relationships?

You can't heal from shame in an unsafe environment.

So you need to have safe people, safe environment, or else if you're with unsafe people, you just keep getting shame messages.

So the better you are, the better you are.

The better you're able to have safe people, the faster you can heal from shame.

Next thing I want you to understand is this.

The initial healing from shame is very real, but it's very fragile.

Some of you might have this experience.

You've been working on yourself.

Let's say you've been coming to Finding Freedom, React, and you're starting to feel better about yourself.

You're actually starting to respect yourself and accept yourself, and you're feeling really good, and then you go and spend the day with mom.

And you come there going, I didn't think, I guess I never learned anything.

I'm right back to feeling crappy about myself.

And the point is this.

You grew, but that growth is fragile.

It's like new leaves on a brand new baby plant.

And the slightest thing can destroy them.

So part of what you have to do in recovery is really set boundaries to protect that growth so it can solidify and become stronger and stronger.

So that is just upfront that you need to be aware of.

Okay, so I want to give you the four steps of healing that we've talked about so far.

And you may not have realized I was throwing some of these in as we went along in the first five talks.

But over every talk, there's been an element of self-awareness.

And what we focus on is self-awareness.

Self-awareness is the ability to be more self-aware.

Self-awareness is the ability to be more self-aware.

And what we focused on last week is that to heal from shame, you have to take this thing that's been operating at a subconscious level and bring it to the conscious level so you understand how you're triggered, what you do when you're triggered.

Then you can change it once you get it to that conscious level.

So self-awareness is the first thing.

Second thing, two weeks ago we talked about the lies we believe about ourselves, both about our value and about what gives us value.

And so now you begin to replace those lies with the truth.

And we talked about that and what it means to respect somebody else and the different types of respect.

We've talked about all of that.

So the point was this.

In dealing with shame, there is a cognitive part.

There's a replacing lies with truth part, but it's not the only part.

There's an emotional part and lots of that that we're going to get to.

The other thing that we saw is in your brain, you have a limbic system that has become a bad...

It speaks a lot of lies to you based on how you feel.

And shame is a negative feeling.

And so your limbic brain says, you're not worth anything.

You shouldn't respect yourself.

You deserve to fail, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

But now you've got a cortex that disagrees with your limbic brain.

So you have a brain that says, you're not worth anything.

You're not worth anything.

You're not worth anything.

And so you have a battle going on in your brain between your limbic brain and your cortex brain.

And so the goal of recovery is that your cortex brain trumps your limbic brain.

So when shame gets triggered, limbic gets fired up and it wants to trump your cortex.

And so what you're doing in healing is saying, shut up limbic brain.

Here is the truth.

I'm not listening to the distorted stuff you tell me.

And it feels like truth, but I know it's a lie.

And now I'm going to respond and act on my cortex, not on my limbic brain.

And then the other piece that we talked about is beginning to have positive affirmations about yourself that you know are the truth about your value, about who you are.

So that's part of that cognitive piece.

The third one that we've talked about with that is developing a healthy value system.

So shame says I have no internal value.

All my value comes from what I do or from my external world.

And so now what you have to do in healing shame is saying, I can't base my value on what I do or my external world because what happens if that changes and I'm no longer able to do it?

I have to find my value in my internal world, my inherent value.

And that, all of these are a process.

All of these don't happen overnight.

But they are stuff that you begin to work on and you begin to experience the changes.

So getting the right value system.

Now, one thing I want to add to that is we talked about sometimes there's a healthy part of getting value from what I do.

But if that's the only source of what makes me feel valuable, then it's going to lead me astray.

So I need to be serving in some capacity, but I have to get value from all kinds of other healthy things, not just from service.

So that was the third one.

The fourth one, if I have value, I treat myself with respect.

My limbic brain says I don't feel valuable, so I'll treat myself by beating myself up, putting myself down.

Cortex says, no, I have value, so I will treat myself with value even though I don't feel like I have value.

So you're acting your way to new, healthier feelings.

You're saying, I have value, treat myself that way regardless of how I feel.

And that is the challenge in dealing with shame.

You are choosing to act on what you know is right, what you know is the truth, even though you don't feel it's that way.

So you're fighting your feelings by choosing to act by treating yourself with respect.

And that can be some of the hardest stuff to do.

Treat yourself with respect.

So bottom line is, as you treat yourself with respect, you start to feel more respect for yourself.

You start to feel like you can require others to have to treat you with respect.

You don't have to put up with their disrespect.

And that creates even greater growth for you in dealing with shame.

So those four we've kind of covered.

Now I'm going to bomb my way right through a whole bunch of other ones.

Some are going, we could go for a whole session on them.

I'm giving you the Kohl's notes, but it's really key, important stuff.

So the next one is accepting yourself.

Now here's what I want you to understand.

When I first started working in the counseling world 30 years ago, what was being talked about all the time was you got to love yourself.

Low self-esteem was on everybody's radar, and you got to love yourself.

But what they were saying was you have to try to create feelings of love for yourself.

And what I found in working with people with tons of shame, they couldn't stir up good feelings.

They couldn't stir up good feelings to themselves.

So if they went to a workshop and they said, look in the mirror and tell yourself you love you and feel all warm and fuzzy to yourself, they're going rolling their eyes going, who is this quack job that's running this class because I can't stir up any positive feelings?

And so I said, okay, for deeply shamed people, that does not work initially.

Where they have to start is not try to get warm feelings to themselves, they have to start by saying, I accept me.

I choose to accept the body I was given.

I choose to accept the personality I was given.

And what does shame say?

I don't like who I am.

Because I think that's the reason I've been neglected and abandoned.

So I wish I wasn't a shy, quiet person.

I wish I was the outgoing leader that was funny all the time.

And you wish that.

You wish that.

You wished for a different personality.

You wished for a different face and all those different things.

You start by making a choice.

I choose to accept this package.

I choose to accept the way I was born.

Now that is easier said than done.

Because you've never done that before.

And so what's going to happen is once you start to want to get down on yourself because you're feeling your shyness and nobody's wanting to talk to you because you want to sit in a corner all by yourself, you go, you know what?

I'm shy.

Instead of seeing that as just a negative, I wonder if there's positives from being shy.

And you think about it from a positive perspective.

So let me give you this.

When I was young, I was super shy.

I was super analytical.

And I didn't like that about myself.

Because I didn't relate to people my own age.

They wanted to talk about stupid things about the latest girl that everybody was excited about.

And I wanted to talk about deeper stuff.

And none of them were interested.

And so I just didn't connect.

And I wished I was something different.

And then at some point I thought, you know what?

I wonder if there's benefits in being this shy thinker.

And I began to look at it from those eyes.

And you realize I would never be effective at what I do today if I wasn't a shy thinker.

So I began to realize being shy has a lot of positives that outgoing people don't have.

And so those are the things that you begin to think about.

Okay, next one.

Not only are you accepting who you are, you also need to accept your past.

So what happens with shame is I hate my upbringing.

I hate my family.

I wish I didn't have it.

I wish I had a whole different set of circumstances.

And you can stay in that place of I wish, I wish, I wish, or if only for the rest of your life.

Or you can come to a point where you say, I can't go back and change anything.

So instead of seeing it as all bad, I wonder what I could learn from it that would make me a better person.

Instead of just being bitter and resentful about it, let's learn the lessons from it.

And you know what you'll find?

You'll learn lessons from your past that people who don't have your past will never learn.

And you will gain strengths from that that they will never get based on their past.

And so at some point, you say, I accept me and I accept my upbringing.

As crappy as it was, I choose to accept it.

Third thing you have to accept, healing is a slow journey.

And it is a messy journey.

So everybody that comes into recovery wants the silver bullet that is going to be the magic pill that they take and they're fixed.

And they never struggle again.

I was talking with somebody today who works with people that are in kind of the most severe federal penitentiaries for the most severe crimes.

They all want to get well, not all, but many want to get well as long as they don't have to work very hard at it.

As long as it's easy.

As long as it doesn't require much change.

That's what they want.

So they all say, I want to get better.

I just don't want to do the work of getting better.

So here's what I do with clients, this little graph.

This is what growth in dealing with shame looks like.

You make some progress, you get triggered, fall flat on your face.

What happens when you fall flat on your face?

You walk around and say, I guess I didn't learn anything.

I'm so stupid.

And you feed your own shame and you beat yourself up.

Wrong response, but that's the normal response.

So eventually you pick yourself back up and you start working again and you start making more progress, get triggered, fall flat on your face.

And that goes like that for a long time.

But what I want you to see is that the overall progression of the graph is you're getting higher and higher.

You're growing.

So think of it this way.

When you have a baby that's getting to that one-year-old mark and they take their first step, do you go, you fell on your face?

You're a failure.

You should be ashamed of yourself.

No, you're applauding.

Way to go, way to go, get back up, try that again.

And you don't fault them, you don't judge them, you don't criticize them.

You realize that to learn such an important skill like walking, which I'm told takes several hundred muscles within the body to get all figured out how to stay balanced, you know that takes a lot of falling on your face.

And what you're hoping is that over time they'll fall less and less and walk more and more and then they'll eventually run.

That's recovery.

You are learning a whole new set of skills that is using muscles and abilities and brain circuits that are brand new, that you've never used before.

You're not going to get it perfectly the first time.

If you don't accept that the journey's like this, you're going to beat yourself up and feed your shame every time you fall on your face.

And you will not progress very far.

So accepting the nature of the journey is important.

Now let me add one piece to this.

The problem with complex trauma is that failure becomes something that the person sees as only bad.

Failure never led to anything good just to pain and punishment.

But what was the actual design of failure?

It was positive.

It was to be an example that you could learn from.

So failure was to be turned into a positive.

That was the design.

But if you come from a background where failure was always bad and always was painful, you're afraid of failure.

And so what you're doing in recovery is changing your thinking there and saying, okay, I'm going to fall on my face.

That's not the end of the world.

That doesn't mean I'm a total failure.

That means I now have something I can learn from.

So I don't repeat that again.

And it turns into a positive learning experience.

Number eight.

And you're going to see these all begin to overlap a little bit.

But you have to forgive yourself for what you've done in the past.

And when you fail today, you have to deal with it, change, and forgive yourself.

So what happens for a child that comes out of complex trauma?

When you do something wrong, there's no way to fix it.

You get punished for it.

You get thrown in your face.

And so you learn that if you fail, beat yourself up.

Beat yourself up.

Get down on yourself.

That's how you were parented.

That's how you now parent yourself.

That feeds shame.

Now let me take it a step further.

You have done a lot of things that you're greatly ashamed of.

Stuff that has hurt your children and created trauma in them.

You made a lot of mistakes in your teens and twenties that you wish you could redo and take back.

But you have to, with complex trauma, go back to the child who's living in danger that they cannot resolve.

They cannot fix.

They cannot get out of to a healthy place.

What was their only solution?

Fight, flight, death.

Fight, flight, freeze.

Survival.

The very tools needed to fight, flight, freeze, lying, not trusting, wearing masks, they messed up your life.

But don't punish the child for trying to survive.

Don't punish the child for using the only tools they had available to survive.

You can't go back and change that child's decisions.

So don't punish them and don't punish yourself for those survival decisions.

You can change them now and you need to do that.

But stop beating yourself up for the things you did to survive.

That is the point I want you to get.

Now let me take it further.

Many people think of forgiveness as a feeling.

A limbic brain think, I'll feel or I'll forgive myself when I feel that I've paid for my crimes.

Well guess when that's going to happen?

Never.

Because you'll keep beating yourself up which will lead to more failure, which will lead to more beating yourself up, etc.

It becomes a vicious cycle that is spiraling downhill.

So what you have to do is this.

I choose to forgive myself.

And what that means is if I fail or if I have a memory of a failure, instead of going to the negative take-home, I'm going to the negative tapes in my head where I beat myself up, I say, no, not going there.

I forgive myself.

I choose to change.

I choose to learn from that and become better because of it.

But I'm not going to go beating myself up.

That's what forgiveness is in forgiving yourself.

Absolutely essential if you're going to deal with your shame.

Now the next two are tied together.

Remember we said that shame is a child looking into the mirror.

The child is looking into the mirrors of the people in their life.

And the people of significance in their life reflect back to them by what they say and do the value of the child, who the child is.

So if the child's neglected and abused and abandoned, what's being reflected back to them is you're a zero.

You're not worth love.

You don't have value.

So those are the mirrors of their life, but they're all distorted mirrors.

What you have to do now if you want to heal your shame is you've got to surround yourself with more accurate mirrors.

People that will reflect back to you a more accurate picture of your value, of who you are, that you are lovable, that you are significant.

But then with that, you need boundaries with unhealthy mirrors.

So you might have to say, I can't hang around with my mom for now.

Because the growth and the healing is too fragile.

And if I spend too much time with her, it's going to get mowed down and crushed.

So I'm going to need some boundaries with the distorted mirrors of my life.

You want to know that that's one of the hardest parts of recovery for a lot of people.

You want to know what many people are still looking for and they don't even realize it?

Even though they might be 30, 40 or 50 years old?

They're still longing for mom and dad to validate them.

So every time they grow, which is going to happen as you deal with your shame, guess who they want to go tell about it?

Mom and dad.

So mom and dad will go, we're so proud of you.

Usually doesn't happen that way.

And you go running to mom and dad and you say, I'm growing.

Here's what's happening.

And they'll think you're better than us.

Do you?

And they mow your right back down.

And you're crushed again.

So you have to realize if I keep looking to them to validate me, I'm never going to heal beyond a certain point.

I need boundaries with those kind of people.

And it's usually family members that need them the most until I get strong enough to deal with it.

And I need to find healthy mirrors who give me good validation.

And I need to learn to validate myself.

So boundaries with mirrors is crucial.

Okay?

So that's not something you do internally.

That's saying other people still influence my shame.

And so I have to have a system in place to protect myself from the wrong ones.

Next one.

Connect with healthier people.

Now I'm not just saying have healthier people as your mirrors.

What I mean is this.

Shame was caused by not being able to connect at an intimate level with people.

And so you've concluded that the reason people didn't connect with you is because you weren't good enough.

It was your fault.

And that creates the shame.

A huge part of healing shame is connecting in a healthy way with safe people.

Do you want to know the fear of a shame-based person is?

I'm going to develop a relationship and I'm going to start becoming more authentic.

I'm going to take my mask away.

I'm going to start to open up.

And then you get to some doozy secret.

And then you share it and you go, oh, they're probably judging me.

I can never face them again.

And you go to that place.

You want to know what usually happens when you do that?

If you're with healthy people, they go, you go through that?

I went through that.

Wow, it's so good to have somebody that understands.

And you go, I wasn't judged.

I was loved.

I was accepted.

I'm respected.

And you heal a little bit more.

So part of connecting with people is opening up, not being judged, but then developing conversations and interactions that go to the real stuff in your life.

Okay, next one.

We're flying along.

Begin to learn about yourself.

What does shame do to a person?

You don't like who you are.

You try to become somebody else.

Now when you start to heal, you go, I don't know who I am.

I don't know if I'm outgoing.

I don't know if I'm shy.

I don't know if I'm funny.

I don't know if I'm serious.

I don't know who I am.

Don't know if I'm good at sports.
