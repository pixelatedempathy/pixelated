   - Realistic client simulations across diverse scenarios
   - Real-time conversation analysis and feedback
   - Session recording and playback capabilities

2. **Bias Detection & Mitigation**
   - Real-time identification of cultural, gender, racial, and socioeconomic biases
   - Actionable feedback for bias correction
   - Cultural competency training modules

3. **Performance Analytics**
   - Competency tracking across therapeutic techniques
   - Progress visualization and trend analysis
   - Comparative benchmarking (anonymized)

4. **Clinical Supervision Tools**
   - Supervisor review and feedback capabilities
   - Session annotation and discussion features
   - Training program administration

### Non-Functional Requirements

   - HIPAA++ compliance (Privacy, Security, Breach Notification Rules)
   - Fully Homomorphic Encryption for sensitive operations
   - End-to-end encryption for data in transit and at rest
   - 6-year audit log retention

2. **Performance**
   - Sub-200ms AI inference response time
   - Sub-50ms FHE operation latency
   - <2s First Contentful Paint
   - Support for 1000+ concurrent sessions

3. **Accessibility**
   - WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance (mandatory)
   - Full keyboard navigation

   - Cognitive accessibility features

4. **Reliability**
   - 99.9% uptime SLA
   - Multi-region deployment with redundancy
   - Automated failover capabilities

## Success Criteria

### Quantitative Metrics

- **Training Effectiveness**: 300% faster skill acquisition vs. traditional methods
- **Diagnostic Accuracy**: 85% improvement in diagnostic accuracy
- **User Satisfaction**: 90/100 user satisfaction score
- **System Performance**: Meet all performance SLA targets
- **Compliance**: 100% HIPAA compliance verification

### Qualitative Goals

- **Professional Validation**: Endorsement from clinical supervisors and training programs
- **Market Position**: Recognition as leading AI-powered training platform
- **Ethical Standards**: Zero incidents of AI bias or therapeutic harm
- **User Trust**: High confidence in platform safety and effectiveness

## Stakeholders

### Primary Stakeholders

- **Mental Health Professionals**: Licensed therapists, counselors, trainees
- **Clinical Supervisors**: Educators and training program administrators
- **Academic Institutions**: Psychology and clinical training programs
- **Training Organizations**: Professional development providers

### Secondary Stakeholders

- **Regulatory Bodies**: HIPAA compliance auditors, professional licensing boards
- **Technology Partners**: Cloud providers, AI model providers, security vendors
- **Research Community**: Academic researchers studying therapeutic training outcomes

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- **Package Managers**: Must use `pnpm` for Node.js, `uv` for Python (no alternatives)
- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript, no `any` types without justification
- **Code Style**: 2 spaces, no semicolons, single quotes, trailing commas
- **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage required (TDD approach)

### Business Constraints

- **Budget**: Limited resources for MVP, phased rollout approach
- **Timeline**: Market pressure for early validation and beta programs
- **Compliance**: HIPAA compliance is non-negotiable, cannot be compromised

### Regulatory Constraints

- **HIPAA**: Full compliance required before production deployment
- **Professional Standards**: Must align with APA, ACA, NASW ethical guidelines
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance is mandatory, not optional
