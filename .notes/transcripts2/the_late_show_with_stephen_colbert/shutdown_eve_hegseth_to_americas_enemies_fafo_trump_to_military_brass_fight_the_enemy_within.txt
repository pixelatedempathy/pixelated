Welcome one and all to The Late Show. I'm your host Stephen Colbert. Ladies and gentlemen. Folks, this. I'm sure this. With Donald Trump as president, there are days that make you go, Whoa. And there are days that make you go, Oh my God. And then there are days that make you go, Whoa my God. Today was one of those days. In fact, the light-hearted story to start our monologue tonight is that it looks the federal government, which is entirely controlled by the Republican Party, is going to shut down in about 20 minutes. Anything? Anything? Let me know. Let me know if anything changes, ? If , it will cut a lot of important services and put a lot of people out of work. But not everyone. Air traffic controllers and most TSA employees are considered essential workers and have to stay on the job even if that means working without pay. Which, of course, which is perfect for anyone who's ever said, I just wish this TSA worker groping my drunk was also angry. plucking an orange. Now, the darker story this evening involves Defense Secretary Pete Hegzeth. Today, Hegzeth gathered our top generals. That was a little late. Today, he gathered our top generals down to Quantico for an unusual speech. Here's how one military analyst described it. Here's what happened. I the new uniforms. Here's what happened. Last Thursday, Hegzeth called hundreds of generals and admirals from all over the world, from the very least of the most powerful, from the very least of the most powerful, from the very least of the most powerful, from the very least of the most powerful, from the very least of the most powerful, from all over the world, from the very important jobs, in for a meeting in Virginia. was live streamed, but Hegzeth was dead set on getting everyone in the same room. According to one source, it's meant to be an eyeball-to-eyeball kind of conversations. He wants to see the generals. , that's it. The male loneliness epidemic has gone too far. Join a bowling league, for Pete's sake. Once the meeting started, Hegzeth emphasized that OUR LEADERS NEEDED A HYPER-SERIOUS, NO-NONSENSE APPROACH TO WAR FIGHTING. TAKE A LOOK. IT'S A GOOD THING. OLIVE SKATEBOARD ACADEMY.COM. THANK YOU. I'M SORRY. I'M SORRY. WAS THAT THE WRONG TAPE? WAS THAT THE WRONG TAPE? MY FAULT. I'M SORRY. WE HAD THE WRONG TAPE. THAT'S ACTUALLY HEGZETH SLAMMING HIS NARDS WITH A SKATEBOARD WHEN HE HOSTED A WEEKEND MORNING SHOW THIS YEAR. STILL MORE DIGNIFIED THAN WHAT HE DID TODAY. BECAUSE IN THE ACTUAL SPEECH HEGZETH WENT FIVE-STAR NOUCHE AND AT ONE POINT PEGGED THE CAMERA WITH WHAT HE WAS SURE WAS GOING TO BE AN APPLAUSE LINE. SHOULD OUR ENEMIES CHOOSE FOOLISHLY TO CHALLENGE US, THEY WILL BE CRUSHED BY THE VIOLENCE, PRECISION, AND FEROCITY OF THE WAR DEPARTMENT. IN OTHER WORDS, TO OUR ENEMIES, WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE DECLARED AS A F.A.F.O. OH. OH, NO. I KNOW THAT FEELING. I'VE BEEN THERE. WHEN YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO LAND, THAT QUIET CROWD REALLY HURTS. IT HAPPENS TO A LOT OF PEOPLE. IT REMINDS ME OF WHEN QUEEN PLAYED WEMBLEY. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. HEGZETH WENT ALL IN ON WHAT HE CALLS HIS WARRIOR ETHOS. TODAY IS ANOTHER LIBERATION DAY. THE LIBERATION OF AMERICA'S WARRIORS, IN NAME, IN DEED, AND IN AUTHORITIES. YOU KILL PEOPLE AND BREAK THINGS FOR A LIVING. I'LL SAY IT. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE GOT TO TURN DOWN THE TEMPERATURE ON THEIR VIOLENT RHETORIC. NOW, I KNOW THAT YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL ME. NOW, I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW. I KNOW. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. A-OH. . YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. THANK YOU. SECH DEF HEGZETH GATHERED OUR MOST IMPORTANT GENERALS FOR OUR LIBERATION. THEY'RE ALL GOING TO BE ABLE TO TELL US WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TELL US. WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TELL US. WE'RE GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO TELL US. AND ONE DAY, WE'LL FIND OUT WHAT THAT WAS. BECAUSE MOSTLY, HE SAID STUFF THIS. NO MORE CLIMATE CHANGE WORSHIP, NO MORE DIVISION, DISTRACTION OR GENDER DELUSIONS. NO MORE DEBRIS. AS I'VE SAID BEFORE AND WILL SAY AGAIN, WE ARE DONE WITH THAT . WHOA. GOSH, DID YOU HEAR THAT, FIVE-STAR GENERALS? PETE DID A SWEAR. HE IS COOL. , I HEAR HE HAS, , TEN PLAY BOYS ON THE SHOW. 10 Playboys under his mattress. It's awfully lumpy. For Pete, for a SecDef Pete, it's all about plain spoken shoot from the hip, man guy doing. We just have to be honest. We have to say with our mouths what we see with our eyes. To just tell it is in plain English. To point out the obvious things in front of us. , you suck monkey butt. in front of us. It's obvious. A big part of Heg's ass warrior ethos is about image. Frankly, it's tiring to look out at combat formations or really any formation and see fat troops. Likewise, it's completely unacceptable to see fat generals and admirals in the halls of the Pentagon. It all starts with physical fitness and appearance. If the Secretary of War can do regular hard PT, can every member of our joint force. Damn straight. In fact, let's see Pete do some of his regular PT. The Ice Skateboard Academy, John Hall. Thank you. And. Technically. Thank you. In that case, PT stands for pound testicle. And I will say this for Heg's F. He never skips nut day. Then it was time for the officers to hear from a true paragon of masculine fitness, Donald Trump. Fat generals, no. Fat generals, meet Captain Cankels. By the way, I don't know if you noticed how he was walking there, but that shamble up to the mic, was about as high as his energy got for the whole day. The president is anti-woke, he's barely conscious. He loves a rally crowd, though. He loves a rally crowd, though. Hey-oh. Hey-oh. What? He loves a rally crowd, but traditionally, the senior leadership of the US military never claps, for example. I'm sorry. He never claps for political speeches. That's the tradition. They're supposed to be nonpartisan and sit there stone-faced. It's doing stand-up for Easter Island heads. Trump didn't love the crowd. I've never walked into a room silent before. what? Just have a good time. And if you want to applaud, you applaud. And if you want to do anything you want, you can do anything you want. And if you don't what I'm saying, you can leave the room. Roger that. I'm sorry. Oh, you mean the generals. You mean the generals. I forgot. I have to till May. I forgot. , . , now, look, I know what you're saying. You're saying, Steve, Trump may have no sense of discipline or decorum, but at least he didn't assemble every general in the world to bring up the N-word. There's that to hold onto, ? Wrong. Here he is talking about the nuclear. . . . We can't let people throw around that word. I call it the N-word. There are two N-words, and you can't use either of them. . No, that's , folks. There's two N-words. One you can never use, and the other you can only use if you're doing karaoke. She take me money. Now. That's my impression of Trump. Doing his impression of Jamie Foxx. His impression of Ray Charles. Thank you very much. Trump talked about how America is respected again. We were not respected with Biden. They looked at him falling downstairs every day. Every day, the guy's falling downstairs. I'm very careful, , when I walk downstairs, I'm on stairs, these stairs. I'm very, I walk very slowly. You don't have to set any record. Be cool. Be cool when you walk down, but don't, don't bop down the stairs. one thing with Obama, I had zero respect for him as a president, but he would bop down those stairs. I've never seen. Da-da, da-da, da-da, bop, bop, bop. What the hell are you talking about? Obama, what, what, Obama, can we see footage of Obama going down the stairs? Da-da, da-da, da-da, bop, bop, bop. , I stand corrected. I was wrong. I'm sorry. Of course, when you call in generals from every corner of the world, you don't just talk about stairs. You talk about office supplies. When I have a general and I have to sign for a general because we have beautiful paper, they're gorgeous paper. I sign for a general. I sign for a general. I sign for a general. I sign for a general. I said, throw a little more gold on it. They deserve it. I want to use the big, beautiful, firm paper. What? What is, why is the paper this? What is, I don't understand. What paper, what paper goes this? Can we see, I'm sorry, can we, what is this? Can we see the big, beautiful, firm paper he's talking about? There you go. , we're not going to do that. We're going to do that. We're going to do that. , we're going to do that. , that makes sense. There you go. We'll be back. Trump then turned his attention to modernizing the Navy. Those ships. Some people would say no, that's old technology. I don't know. I don't think it's old technology when you look at those guns. But it's something we're actually considering, the concept of battleship. Battleship. We're also considering the concept of Twister. The notion of Hungary as the best country. I've learned that, I have learned that. I mean, actually. HUNGRY HIPPO. AND OF COURSE, YAZI, OR IN MY CASE, NEO-YAZI. THERE YOU GO. FAR, NUTS. BUT TRUMP ALSO WENT VERY DARK AT TIMES, WARNING THE MILITARY BRASS ABOUT AMERICA'S NUMBER ONE ENEMY, AMERICANS. LAST MONTH I SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER TO PROVIDE TRAINING FOR QUICK REACTION FORCE THAT CAN HELP QUELL CIVIL DISTURBANCES. THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG THING FOR THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM BECAUSE IT'S THE ENEMY FROM WITHIN, AND WE HAVE TO HANDLE IT BEFORE IT GETS OUT OF CONTROL. WHAT DO YOU. A QUICK REACTION FORCE TO HANDLE THE ENEMY WITHIN? HOW WOULD WE EVEN KNOW WHO THAT ENEMY IS? DO WE EXPLAIN THAT? DO WE EXPECT THEM TO JUST COME OUT AND IDENTIFY THEMSELVES? YOU KNEW DAMN I WAS A SNAKE BEFORE YOU TOOK ME IN. I GUESS . WE GOT A GREAT SHOW FOR YOU TONIGHT. GRAMMY AWARD-WINNING ARTIST SAM SLIDEN IS HERE, BUT WHEN WE COME BACK, IT'S OUR FRIEND JIMMY KIMMEL. STICK AROUND. FOOT IT OVER TO New York !
