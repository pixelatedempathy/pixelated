If you have ongoing exposure to controlling people, it's a virtual certainty that you're going to experience blurry boundaries, which is why I have created the extensive online course called This Is Me, Establishing Boundaries with the Controllers in Your Life. There's a link below that will give you all of the details, and I hope that you would find it therapeutic. This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me This Is Me I felt so alone. I had to get away from the toxic fumes, but I felt terrified. You know, I read through these kind of comments and there are more, and I know that many of you can recall some or add to the list here. But I read through comments like this and I'm thinking, yeah, this is what happens. This is what trauma bonding does to a decent person. That narcissist who's got such a strong control agenda and has somehow or another convinced himself or herself that it's a reasonable thing to grind you into the ground. They give you so many messages and there are so many experiences where they rob you of your own decency that this is what happens to an otherwise very decent kind of an individual. And I want you to understand that if you've been on the receiving end of this, you don't have to stay. We call it trauma bonding. The narcissist wants to bond to you, but it really is okay for you to say, no, no, I can't do this. And so I want to give you a few thoughts here. If you've been associated with a narcissist who has tried to bond you to them through this trauma, and don't want to do it, then I want you to take a moment to think about this. And I want you to take a moment to think about this. And I want you to take a moment to think about this. I want you to take a moment to think about this. And I want you to take a moment to think about this. I want you to take a moment to think about this. And I want you to take a moment to think about this. Another thought that I hope that you can hold on to is drop the notion that you're duty bound to a narcissist. That notion was drilled into you by somebody who used what I call, they made heavy use of what I call imperative thinking, imperative communication. And basically that means you must, you have to, you've got to, you're obliged. There's a certain agenda and you cannot deviate from the agenda. That's a wrong thought. That's a wrong notion. And when they came at you with that heavy, heavy imperative, they were speaking falsely. I hope you remember that. Another thing that I'm hoping you can remember, and that is, it's necessary for you to claim your freedom. See, one of the first tasks that a malignant narcissist wants to do to keep you bonded to them is they want to take away your notion that says, I get to choose. I get to choose for myself. But the fact is, that is a true statement. You do get to choose for yourself. And you may have to kind of reinforce that notion over and over. You get to decide what defines you, what traits you want to have most predominant in the way that you engage with people. And in fact, if you want to make a list and write it out, here are the traits that I want to have as I define who I am, I think that would be a great idea. And then I attach those traits to specific things. Specific circumstances. That would be a good journaling kind of exercise for you. You get to decide what your priorities are and what your preferences are. And you don't have to apologize for you being you. The narcissist wanted you to get rid or to forget about your freedom to choose. Hold on to that one. Remember, you get to, you're free. You get to choose. Now, in addition, I do think it's very necessary when you've been bonded to a malignant narcissist, that it would be a good thing to choose. And I think that's a good thing to do. And I think that's a good thing to do. And I think that's a good thing to do. It would be a good idea if you can get a therapist that can help you work that through. Or if that is not available to you, get a good support group or a friend or a confidant. It's good to hear from someone else the words, I love you. I care about you. You matter. In my eyes, you're a respected person. I hope that you can find that person. One of the things that tends to happen when you've been in a trauma situation, in a trauma bond, is that you have been isolated. Don't isolate. Avail yourself to people who know how to bring the best out of you. And then finally, we can say, as you try to get away from the bonds of that malignant narcissist, be patient with yourself. There are going to be times when you're going to start defending yourself unnecessarily or explaining yourself way beyond what is necessary. And your friends are going to say, hey, you don't need to explain yourself. You're going to be able to do it. You don't need to apologize and all. It's like, yeah, I've kind of gotten used to it. Some of the old habits may die hard, but I'm hoping you can use new habits. And it starts with you loving yourself and respecting yourself and living with your own sense of good intentions leading the way. So the red flags that we're going to have that says that a person has been pulled into a trauma bond is that there's a high, high control relationship. It tends to lead to a lot of conflict and strain and tension, very strong opinions. That person will not adjust their thoughts. And I hope that as you're able to see the indicators of trauma bonding, you can decide, you know what? Like I say, I am not obliged to that anymore. And I'm going to stand in self-respect because that's what I deserve. And to that malignant narcissist, we're going to say, you need to be in my rearview mirror. I don't need input from you. Period. Now there's so much that needs to be addressed when we're talking about trauma bonding. But I hope that this talk that I'm giving to you can let you know there, like I said, the reason I wanted to read these comments, there are other people have been through this with you. You're not alone. But there are also people who've been able to recover. And the reason that I put these videos out there is to help you in that recovery process. If you've not already subscribed, I would encourage you to do so. You've heard me. You've heard me mentioned about therapy. I strongly encourage therapy.
