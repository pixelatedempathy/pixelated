 Well, welcome to another Friday night. We've been doing a series on a deeper look at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma.  And tonight we come to the topic of manipulation.  A manipulation is a word we hear frequently, but what I want to do tonight is help you think it through in more detail.  And to help you see that manipulation can have a variety of different reasons why people do it.  But I think one of the main causes of people starting to manipulate is complex trauma.  And that's what I want to focus on tonight is helping us understand that and why we do it and how to change that.  So let me begin with a definition manipulation is any attempt to sway a person's emotions or thinking.  So changing how they think or they feel in order to get them to act in a specific way.  Or it's an attempt to control others so that they meet what you perceive are your needs.  So they do what you want. And often at their expense.  So in other words, it's exploitive. It uses people. It's deceptive. There's a hidden agenda.  And it's an attempt to seize power in a relationship.  In other words, it is not a healthy thing. It violates love.  And we're going to see it does a lot of damage.  But the question is why do people manipulate if it destroys marriages, if it's not a healthy thing to do.  Why do so many people do it?  So let me come at it from the complex trauma perspective.  And let me begin by just giving you a healthy home and what it would be like for a child in a healthy home.  So a child comes into the world with instincts to be authentic, to be trusting,  to openly communicate all of their needs, all of their emotions, their desires, and their dreams.  And in a healthy home, they're listened to.  The parents work to understand the child.  And then the parents, as they listen to the child's needs and desires.  And all of their sharing, they then are figuring out from a wise mind what is healthy for the child,  what is best in order to meet those needs.  So in a healthy home, a child doesn't have to manipulate anybody to get their needs met.  They just honestly communicate everything about themselves.  But in a complex trauma home,  the same child comes with all of those natural instincts to be authentic,  to express their needs and desires and dreams.  And it's a different response.  Sometimes they're made to feel they're being selfish for having those needs.  And they're punished for that.  Or they're ignored.  Or those needs are then used to shame them and make fun of them.  And so they learn that they're not going to get your needs met by asking,  or by telling them your needs.  The only way to get your needs met is you're going to have to figure out how to meet them, get them met yourself.  You're going to have to manipulate.  And so, if you want to survive in this house,  manipulation is a necessary survival tool.  And sadly, that is what has happened to so many children.  And so, put it this way.  What does a child do when their needs aren't met, but nobody seems to care?  They have to figure out how to work people to get those needs met.  What does a child do when saying what you want is met by scorn and derision?  Well, you can no longer be honest.  You've got to have hidden agendas.  And then as that complex trauma works itself out,  what the child then develops is this shame.  The reason they're not meeting my needs is because I'm not good enough.  I'm not lovable.  And so now when they go into any relationship, they go,  the last thing I can do is share honestly who I am and what I need  because it will be met the same way it was met in my biological family.  So now in all future relationships,  the only way I'm going to get my needs met is by being secretive and manipulating people.  And then another issue that can come up is what does a child do with a dictator parent?  So in a healthy home, parents work with children and sometimes they put their foot down  and say, this is the way it's going to be.  But only if they understand the child and what's best in that situation.  But in other times they're going to negotiate with the child.  They're going to give into the child.  But what happens if you have a dictator parent where it's their way or the highway  who never gives in, who's always got to be right?  What then does the child do in order to get what they need or want?  They must manipulate that parent.  Or they must find ways around that parent.  And then a child also has this huge need for stability and security.  But what happens in a child's world where it's not stable,  it's not secure, parents are fighting, getting a divorce.  All of those things are going on.  They must learn to manipulate, to try, to be in control  because everything feels out of control.  So they feel a helplessness and in order to get a feeling of power  they need to learn to manipulate and control situations.  So manipulation then becomes a very necessary tool for survival in a complex trauma family.  So let me take that a bit further.  What then is required of a child in that environment is not just learning how to manipulate,  but it's being a student, a very good student of people.  So now I must know dad's mood.  I must know dad's weaknesses.  I must know mom's mood and weaknesses.  I must learn what I can use against them.  I must be effective.  And I need to learn their personalities and what they value if I am going to manipulate them effectively.  And so I need to develop a good radar that detects the moods of everybody in the family all the time  so I know what to do.  But then I need to find what manipulation tools work best for me.  So if I'm very pretty or I can flirt well or if I'm very responsible looking or I'm very funny,  maybe I can use those.  So I got to try different techniques to find out which one seems to be the most effective in getting what I want.  And so a child is learning about themselves and their tool kit when it comes to manipulation,  as well as learning about the subjects that they are going to be manipulating.  Now let me add a couple of things.  For many children, they manipulate at a subconscious level.  They're not even aware that they're doing it.  They're just trying to survive.  And so it's not something they're setting out to do from a very kind of evil wicked place.  The second thing is that what a child begins to develop over the years are different tools that can be used to manipulate different tactics.  So they're building a toolbox of manipulation tools.  And what they will do is they'll try manipulation tool number one.  If it doesn't work, not a problem. They'll go on to manipulation tool number two.  And if that doesn't work, not a problem. They got three, four, five, six.  And I'm going to give you 31 different tools that can be used to manipulate others.  And so just because the first one doesn't work does not mean that they're going to quit trying to manipulate.  The more tools they have in their toolbox, the more they'll keep trying new things.  And it will take them a long time to run out and get to a point where they realize they can't manipulate that person.  The next thing that I want you to understand is this.  So complex trauma causes a child to have a sense of helplessness when it comes to manipulating their or getting their needs met.  The more severe the trauma, the greater the shame and sense of helplessness.  And so for some people they manipulate not just to get their needs met but to feel power over other people.  And so as they get into adult life and enter any relationship, they start manipulating not just get their needs met.  But to gain a position of power over somebody else so that they can use them and manipulate them.  And in cases of very severe trauma, what can also happen is they don't just want that position of power.  But to really enforce how powerful they are, they need to have a cruelty aspect to their manipulation.  They need to make others look stupid. They need to hurt others.  They need to make others feel helpless and it takes a very cruel direction.  So let me give you these 31 different manipulation tactics.  And again, you can check off the ones that apply to you and see just how big of an issue this manipulation thing is in your life.  And whether it's still a major issue for you that needs a lot of work.  So number one, use intense emotional connection to control another person's behavior.  So imagine that a guy has cheated on his partner.  And she's threatening to leave.  And she probably should, but he is afraid of losing her.  So what does he do?  He buys her a new car. He gives her candlelight dinner.  He gives her roses. He gives her all kinds of things.  He takes her on a holiday. Why to create all these loving feelings?  Because if he can create all these loving feelings, then he can get her to give them another chance.  So it's the intense oxytocin feelings in the limbic brain that cause somebody to say,  okay, I'll let you manipulate me.  Now, I should say that a lot of these manipulation tactics appeal to the limbic brain.  Their attempt is to change your limbic brain.  And then if they can change your limbic brain, it can change your thinking,  and then that is what will cause you to give in to what they want to do,  even if you see through their plan.  The second one is connected, and a lot of these will kind of overlap a little bit,  but love bonds.  And so again, let's say you set a boundary with your parents,  and say, you can't keep phoning ten times a day and dropping over to visit without phoning ahead of time.  And they, what do they do?  Well, they start offering to babysit. They come and they buy a whole bunch of groceries for you and show up with groceries.  They bomb you with love because what are they wanting you to do?  Is to go, how can I set a boundary with people that are so kind to me?  That would feel wrong to set a boundary with them to say no.  And so love bonds are there to break down your natural guard,  to bring you to a place where you trust or let them back into your life,  even though they maybe don't deserve it.  Another one, play on a person's securities.  So this is what advertising companies do all the time.  How do they get you to buy their product even though you don't really need it?  They're manipulating you, so they try to make it sound like because you have gray hair,  because you have a few wrinkles, because you have a bit of extra weight that you're not sexy or desirable or beautiful,  so you'll go out and buy their product.  They're appealing to your insecurities and manipulating you based on those things.  And you can get a partner who will cause you to think that nobody else will want you  because of these insecurities in you and that will keep you loyal to them even though they might be abusive.  And then they let you speak first.  So you go out on your first date, your second date, and they ask you questions about yourself.  They act like they're really interested in learning about you.  But what you find, later down the road, isn't letting you speak first.  They were just gathering information about you.  They were getting to know you so they could learn how to work you, how to manipulate you.  All that you shared, you thought you were sharing to a person who genuinely cared,  no, you were sharing with a manipulator who was gaining information about how to manipulate you.  And then guilt.  And this is one of the most common ones within biological families.  So again, you set a boundary with your parents and they say, after all we've done for you,  that's how you're going to treat us.  Or you're so selfish and they are going to try and make you feel guilty.  Now, this brings us to a very important point.  A person can't manipulate you with guilt unless you have some guilt that you haven't resolved.  So manipulation only works if it connects with something in you.  And that is what gives them the power over you is exploiting that unresolved area inside of you.  False accusations.  So parents or family or friends might say, you think you're better than us.  That's why you're setting a boundary with us.  And they're trying to get you again to tear it down, but you don't think you're better than them.  But they spin it that way to create guilt.  Or family might say, when you start setting boundaries with families and building your own support network that's healthier,  is that you don't value your family.  After all, we've done to be there for you.  All you think about is yourself.  You don't think about the needs of others.  None of those things are true, but they spin it with a false accusation to try and create  guilt.  Many manipulators will bombard you with false accusations, lies.  And they will get you to the point where you're questioning maybe they're telling the truth.  And if you challenge their lies, they will replace it with another lie just to get you to start to doubt yourself.  And that will wear you down, and I'll come back to that.  And then misrepresenting the issue.  So you never do this.  You always do this.  Very vague generalities.  Exaggerations.  But it's misrepresented.  It's skewed a little bit.  And so, how do you debate a generality?  You can debate a specific event.  But they try to give this sensationalized, over dramatic hyperbole that gets you to begin to doubt yourself.  So they're misleading you by presenting a distorted picture of the fox.  They're misrepresenting the issue.  Another one, again, connected flawed logic.  So if you build a new support network, a surrogate family, they might say families stay together.  You don't pull away from your family and go somewhere else.  You don't need those people.  And what they're doing is trying to keep their power over you by using flawed logic.  And many people fall for it.  Next one, they'll play the martyr.  They'll attempt to get you to feel sorry for them.  Oh, I can't eat or sleep because of the decisions you're making in your life.  I'm worried sick about you.  Now, that would be good if the person was making bad decisions.  But if you're making good decisions to get healthy, which means setting boundaries, which means new activities.  And they're using that by saying they can't sleep.  And they're sick thinking about the decisions you're making.  Then they're trying to get you to feel sorry for them.  And they're trying to create guilt in you.  Then they study you.  And so let's say they look, they're looking for your insecurities and they find that you really like validation.  That you seek validation in your relationship.  So guess what they're going to do now?  Every time they meet you or every time they want something, they're going to validate you.  And it's going to just make your limbic brain get all warm and fuzzy and then they can manipulate you.  Or they might say, I'm not sure you love me.  So here's how you can prove that you love me.  If you love me, you'll do this for me.  And so now they're manipulating you by getting you to think that that's how you prove your love to them.  Then there's what you call foot in the door.  And so what we mean by this is a person who asks you for something very small.  You're heading downtown.  That's where I'm heading to.  Would you mind giving me a ride?  That seems like a really small request but to get your foot in the door.  And if they say yes to that, then as you're driving with them downtown, you might then say,  you know what, I'm really strapped for cash.  Could I borrow $20?  So they got their foot in the door with a little request which then gave them the courage to go for a bigger request.  Then the flip of that is the door in the face.  And that's where they come out and ask for something ludicrous.  We should go on a $10,000 vacation.  And you go, that's ridiculous.  And then they go to a smaller thing and say, well maybe we could just go for a night out.  And do what I want to do here by going for this night out.  So you go, okay, I'll give you that in light of not giving you this great big ludicrous thing.  Fear is another very big one that people use.  So threats of violence.  So they might say, I'll hurt you, I'll hurt your loved ones.  Or they might threaten to commit suicide if you don't do what they want.  Or they might use anger and intimidation.  And so children from complex trauma often are afraid of angry people.  So when somebody starts getting really angry at them, their first minds it is, I'll give you whatever you want.  Just don't be angry.  And so it works very effective on them.  Some go to a passive aggressive type of manipulation.  And so they can just start pushing their partner's buttons.  So they do things just to annoy their partner.  Why? Because their partner isn't giving them what they want.  So I'm going to annoy you.  And if you say, why are you doing that?  What do you mean? I'm not doing anything.  And you can deny that you're trying to hurt them or manipulate them.  Or you can give them just the silent treatment.  I'm not going to talk to you.  Or you can withhold love.  They're going to come wanting a hug, wanting to talk.  And they hit a stone wall.  You're not giving them anything.  Or you might cry and pote and act very side and mope all around the house.  And they finally say, okay, I'll give you what you want.  Just stop acting like that.  Just love me please.  And it worked.  Others use nagging effectively.  I'll ask for something.  If you say no, I'll ask again.  I'll ask until I wear you down and you finally give in.  And many children learn to do that with tired parents.  That if I ask long enough, they'll eventually give in.  Some resort to begging.  Please, please, I'll do whatever you want.  Please just give it to me.  Others set out to punish you.  They're not even secretive about it or subtle about it.  They speak very disrespectfully.  They treat you very disrespectfully.  They are punishing you and you know it.  And they're not going to stop until you give them what they want.  Some create a crisis.  So let's go back.  You set a boundary with your parents.  And all of a sudden you get a phone call.  Something bad is happening.  Your sister's in trouble and they're trying to get you to rush to the situation.  Get involved again with the family the way you used to be.  The crisis caused you to forget all the boundaries that you set with your family.  Some propose a compromise.  So let's say you say to a person you've been in a relationship with.  Okay, this relationship isn't working, it's over.  And they come back and say okay, okay, but could we still be friends?  Or could we still go out for coffee?  And what they're hoping is if you agree to the compromise that we can still go out for coffee,  that will just gradually lead back to being in a relationship again with them.  Some use what we call triangulation.  So let's say you set a boundary with mum and all of a sudden you get a phone call from your dad  or your sister or your aunt saying why are you treating your mum so cruelly?  So mum doesn't speak directly to you.  She speaks through another party.  And then some they go out and they recruit support.  So now you get all your aunts and uncles and grandparents and siblings coming and  ganging up on you and saying why are you treating mum so badly?  Or mum might get her support by going to Google and finding on the internet all kinds of documents that say  you should give into your mother because that's what love is.  And they get their support from the internet.  And I think you know you can get the internet to basically you can find something that supports almost any idea  if you look long enough.  Some use shame.  You should be ashamed of yourself.  I'm going to treat you as inferior.  I'm going to treat you as not valuable.  And that feeling of not being good enough drives some people to do whatever they want to get rid of that.  Some when they get in a relationship they start a system.  They start an environment of regular criticism.  I don't like this. I don't like that.  You're not being a good partner.  You're not meeting my needs and criticize, criticize until the person says I'll do whatever you want.  Just stop criticizing me.  And then disrespect.  So you in a relationship are very respectful until you don't get what you want.  And then all of a sudden you resort to fighting dirty, to hurting the other person with words.  By saying words you would never say to anybody else just to crush them to break them.  Some try bargaining.  And they say you know what?  If you'll do this for me then I'll do this for you.  Now the trick usually is if you do this for them they're not going to do this for you.  They're just making a false promise that they're going to do this for you just to get you to do that for them.  And then some try to put you in their debt.  So they cover for you. They lie for you.  They do extra sacrifices for you. So now you owe them.  And so when they need you to lie for them or do what they want they hold that over your head.  Someone goes further and they use blackmail.  They know secrets about you that you are protecting and if those secrets came out it could destroy your career or your marriage.  And so now every time they want you to do something they hold that secret over your head and blackmail you.  Now there's another type of manipulation that is very gradual.  And so you don't see it right away.  It takes time to get to the point you can manipulate effectively.  And that is that you gradually wear a person down.  You mistreat them, disrespect them, shame them, make them criticize them, make them feel not good enough.  Over and over and over and their shame deepens.  Their self esteem gets lower. They feel worse about themselves. They feel like a failure.  They feel like they can't do anything right.  And as you wear them down they eventually are afraid to make decisions and just let you make decisions.  Another form of that is what we call gaslighting.  And it's gradually getting your partner or the other person to doubt their perception of things, their memory of things and their ability to think accurately.  And so you question them, you say, I don't remember that, you're making that up.  And they get you to doubt yourself, doubt yourself. Maybe I didn't see that properly. Maybe my memory is going.  Maybe I don't think clearly until you get to the point where you totally doubt yourself.  And at that point you give all of your power to that other person and let them control you.  Thirty-one different types of manipulation. How did you do?  What are the consequences? Because you say, okay, what's a big deal? I manipulate.  Do you realize that if you're a manipulator that people will gradually lose respect for you and stop trusting you?  Because you can't trust a manipulator who has hidden agendas and you don't respect them.  As a result of that, that makes you an unsafe person.  People do not trust you and feel safe around you. That then prevents healthy relationships with people.  You can't have a healthy relationship where there's not authenticity, honesty, where there's using people, where there's devious types of behavior.  And so what happens for many people or manipulators is, I will give you love as long as I don't need anything.  But as soon as I need something, my desire for that need is so great that manipulation will now trump loving you.  Because now my concern is only using you to get what I want.  And so it begins to destroy love.  And it prevents the growth of everything healthy in a relationship, trust and intimacy and connection and authenticity.  So you can keep on manipulating but eventually you're going to lose more and more and more in relationships in the very things that you're wanting.  So what do you do to get healthy?  Well, if you realize, wow, I am manipulated by others very easily. I'm very vulnerable to being manipulated by others.  Find out what is it that causes me to be so vulnerable? Is it because of guilt? Is it because of shame? Is it because of fear of anger?  Is that what they use to manipulate me? Those unresolved areas of my life are unresolved wounds. So begin to work on those areas.  And then if you are in a relationship and you realize somebody is manipulating you, phrase that is sometimes used as observed but don't absorb.  And what that means is just watch what they're doing and go wonder why they're doing that but no I don't have to play the game.  I don't have to respond to that. I don't have to give in to that.  And then the next thing is if you're in a relationship, figure out which of my needs am I responsible for and which of my needs do I need help from others.  And my partner which are his needs or her needs that they're responsible for and which needs do they need me.  And that will help you be able to say if they're trying to manipulate you to meet a need that they should be meeting themselves, you can call them on that and you can know that you don't need to give in to that.  So bottom line is if you're prone to being manipulated, work on setting and enforcing healthy boundaries, work on saying no.  And so people who manipulate, they don't respect boundaries. They're trying to get you to change your boundaries.  And so it becomes absolutely essential that you develop a strong enough backbone to say these are my boundaries.  I do not feel guilty for respecting myself even though you don't.  I don't feel guilty for standing up for myself.  And so I am saying no and if you don't like me for that, I'm not going to feel guilty because that's your problem, not mine.  What then do you do in responding to a manipulator? Do you go and talk to them? Do you say I don't appreciate that you're trying to manipulate me?  You might, but you need to make sure that the person is open to looking at their issues.  So a lot of people we saw don't realize that their manipulators is a subconscious thing.  So you might decide to go and point it out to them. Once you point it out to them, you begin to see whether they're willing to look at that or not.  And one way to find that out is if you point it out to them and they respond with a verbal backlash,  they begin to really twist it and try to turn it back on you, then you go, this person is not safe to talk about their manipulation issues.  It always results in a negative backlash on me.  And so what you can do in that case is just say, you know what? I'm not even going to bring it up anymore.  I'm just going to set a boundary.  There's no point in confronting them or being honest with them because they are not willing to change.  And so every time I try to talk to them, they just see it as an opportunity to twist things and use it against me.  So I'm going to stop talking. I'm going to set a boundary.  But let me add, be prepared for war because they do not like boundaries.  They want their needs met the way they want them met and you are messing up their agenda.  Finally, if you realize that you have manipulation problems, you manipulate other people,  bottom line learn to express your needs with safe people, build a support network of people where you don't need to manipulate.  You can be authentic, you can connect, you can trust, you can share what you need, you can share your dreams and desires.  And so to do that, what I encourage people to do is stop a couple of times every day and just go, what do I need physically today?  What do I need emotionally, relationally, spiritually, and just get an assessment of your needs?  And some people use a list of the 12 needs that we've laid out that people have to do an inventory a couple of times a day.  And then if you realize, oh, I've got an emotional need here or a physical need here, then go, okay.  I need, if I can't meet this myself, but I need help from others, then I need to be able to go and honestly talk to somebody about it.  Now, understand that the moment you agree with yourself to go and talk to somebody, fear is going to rise.  Because it's going to say, what happens if they say, no, what happens if they think I'm a terrible person?  What happens if they think I'm selfish or a burden? All of those things are going to go up.  So you're going to have to walk through that fear and say, no, I have to stop manipulating. I need open, honest, safe relationships.  So I will tell somebody my needs. But then you have to be prepared that they might say no.  And so when you go and ask, you kind of have to turn it over and let it go and say, I'm not going to try to control them if they say, no, I'm not going to try to manipulate them.  If they say, no, I must accept their boundary. It doesn't mean I'm bad. It doesn't mean I'm done anything wrong. It doesn't mean they don't like me.  It probably just means they're not able to meet that need right now. And so I can go talk to somebody else.  But that is scary. But after you do that a few times, you'll begin to find that, wow, nobody's shame me. Nobody judged me harshly.  They actually were there for me. And it'll help you to grow.  And then if you find yourself slipping back into manipulation. And for many, that's kind of a default setting.  Catch yourself. Stop. And once you realize I'm sliding in manipulation, ask why?  What subconscious need is motivating me to do that? What's going on here? And once you figure out what needs you're trying to meet, then go, OK, what would be a healthy way to meet that need?  Well, I hope that helps you. And I hope you see that manipulation destroys everything. Honest authenticity with safe people is absolutely necessary.  That's the end of part one. I'm going to take a short break. Come back for part two, which is a Christian part if you're not interested in that.  Not a problem. Thank you for having been with us for the first part. And everybody else will be back in a minute.  Thank you very much.  Well, welcome back. We've been looking at Peter, one of the 12 disciples that Jesus had, man who became a very important leader after Jesus returned to heaven.  And we've been looking at the vignettes that were given in the gospel records, the four accounts written about Jesus' life.  And I hope you're really finding them helpful in just seeing some of Peter's issues are very similar to those with complex trauma.  And what Jesus was teaching him is also very important for people with complex trauma in their healing journey.  As we look at the life of Peter, there's one issue that keeps repeating itself. It comes up over and over again. And that was the disciples arguing about who was the greatest, the competition of who does Jesus love most?  Who's he going to give the most important job when he becomes the Messiah or the king?  And so there was this ongoing fight amongst the disciples and Peter we see is often in it. And so the latest, the passage we're coming to now, they're arguing again.  And it's very possible that it has come out of what just happened recently when Jesus took Peter, James and John, just those three up a mountain and he was transfigured.  He all of a sudden became like the bright sun. He was transfigured before them. And I wonder if those three came down Peter, James and John and said, huh, we're more important than the other nine.  Jesus loves us more. He's going to give us the biggest jobs. And so the argument starts up again. And so Jesus begins or has to again address this issue.  So before I look at what Jesus says, let me give you a sense of where the disciples were coming from when they talked about greatness.  They were using a definition of greatness that came out of their culture. It wasn't God's definition.  And that cultural definition sadly is still around today. And many of us still get drawn into thinking of greatness the wrong way.  So the cultural definition is you are great or the more people you have power over, the greater you are, the greater your position of authority, the greater you are.  And another way to say that the more people under you who are serving and doing stuff for you and carrying out your agenda, the greater you are.  And then that often translated in if you have more wealth than others, you're greater than them. If you have more accomplishments than others, you're greater than them.  So greatness was defined by externals and it was defined by authority position. So what does Jesus do? It says in Matthew 18, about that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?  And I think they were hoping he would give them a cultural thing so that would help them in their argument figure out who was the greatest disciple.  But here's what Jesus does. He called a little child to him and put them among them. Then he said, I tell you the truth. Unless you become like little children, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.  So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. That would have just blown their minds.  Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf is welcoming me. But if you cause one of these little ones who trust in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone, a great big rock tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.  So let me talk about this child. The word used is a very young child, a toddler, one, two years old. Here's what I want you to understand.  Where would the culture of that time on their ladder, measuring greatness, status, position, authority, power over people? Where would a child come on that ladder on the very lowest wrong?  So what Jesus is saying, greatness is actually going to be the opposite of what you think based on cultural beliefs about greatness.  So why would the child be put on the lowest wrong? Well, a child can't contribute financially. A child doesn't have positions of power. They're very needy individuals.  They're marked by nothing, but it seems weakness, physical needs, emotional needs. People have to do everything for them. So they would be put on the lowest wrong.  But Jesus says, if you offend a child, put this millstone around their neck and throw them in the ocean. In other words, if you offend a child, I want you to treat the person who offends a child like you would treat somebody who would offend somebody great by your definition.  Because this child is the epitome of greatness. Now what is going on here? What is Jesus saying? So Jesus is identifying the flaws of the cultural definition of greatness.  It is based on position rather than character. It requires that there be superiority. You've got to be better than other people, superior to other people, which requires having people inferior to you.  It requires not having weaknesses. You can't display weakness. You can't display sadness. You can't display vulnerability. So you can't be authentic.  So what culture has done in creating strong leaders is saying to be a strong leader, you have to give up the most precious parts of being human, vulnerability, emotions, trust, authenticity.  In other words, to be a great strong leader, you've got to kill parts of your soul. You have to become less human.  So Jesus brings this little toddler over and he says, this is the standard of greatness. What is he saying?  Remember we talked about children come into the world with these natural instincts for trust, authenticity, vulnerability, total open expression. They are the purest form of being created in the image of God.  And so they come with this beautiful characteristics wanting to connect with people, wanting justice, wanting to love people, seeing everybody as an equal, trust, authenticity.  They are the way God designed humans to be before humans started murdering parts of their soul. And so what Jesus is saying is, your human standard says, destroy parts of your soul and base it all on externals.  God's standard is become fully God's image again. Be real, be authentic, be trusting, be vulnerable, connect. All of those become what makes a person great, it's internal.  You want to, Jesus is saying this part I love. What is the recovery journey? It is getting healthy. But what does it mean to get healthy? It means to take those parts of ourselves that we killed in order to survive in complex trauma and to bring them back to life so that we become authentic again.  We learn to trust again. We stop manipulating. We are open and honest. We connect with people in a genuine way. We become more like the image of God. That is what is involved in being healthy. That is recovery.  But you see, Jesus is saying, you're heading to greatness. By becoming like a child, you're becoming great because you're becoming the way you were designed to be. You're becoming healthier.  What a beautiful lesson Jesus is giving Peter. He is saying, Peter, you are living in a culture where in the attempt to be great, people have actually become less.  And what I'm asking you to do is look like, do what looks like becoming less by becoming like a child, but it's actually going to be becoming healthy and great and the most like God on the inside.  What a beautiful lesson for Peter. Now let me take that further. A child, yes they're weak and vulnerable,  but they have a strong parent that they can trust. And so what Jesus is saying, Peter, Peter, the reason you can become like a child and become truly great is because you have me.  You have me to trust. I will not let you down.  Now there's one final thing that Jesus says to Peter and the disciples in Matthew 20. And it's all about greatness again. So Jesus called the disciples together.  And he said, you know that the rulers of this world lured it over their people and officials and flaunt their authority over those under them.  But among you, it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be a servant. Whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.  For even the son of man, the greatest person in the universe, came not to be served, but to serve others and to give his life a ransom for many.  What is God's design and giving people positions of authority? Is it so that they're better than everybody else so that they can give lots of orders and become these selfish people with everybody serving them?  No, the reason he gives authority is so we are in a greater position to serve, to serve the people under our care. That's what parenting is about.  That's what leadership is to be about. So true greatness is servanthood by God's definition.  I hope that just helps you and warms your heart and helps you again realize that you're on the right track in your growth. Let's pray.  Father, what a beautiful lesson. The last person people would have thought you would have turned to illustrate greatness would have been to a child.  But as we understand what you were communicating, we just see it's a beautiful understanding of what getting healthy, what becoming great is all about.  So I just pray you would encourage us, teach us and help us. Amen.  Well, thank you so much again for being part of this Friday night. I look forward to seeing you again next Friday.
