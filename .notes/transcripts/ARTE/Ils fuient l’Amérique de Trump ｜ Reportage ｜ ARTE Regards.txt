OK. So just wait here. The taxi. This is the fucking taxi. It's over there. Chris Kelly and his daughter Teresa have just landed in Barcelona, from California. Seven bags. Seven, eight, nine. Ten, eleven, ten. My whole life. I'm nervous about school. I'm nervous about like, coming here to Spain and not knowing a bunch of Spanish. Go ahead. You're going to go with the cab. Gracias. Where are you from? San Diego. Maybe there's someone here from Canada. Because of the current political situation. Everyone's worried about what's happening in the United States. Judging what's going on in America right now. He's eating what? He said the food is so good. Oh. So good., you're going to take me out to the world. Oh. Gris 62. And his 17-year-old daughter. They left everything to start a new life in Barcelona. Everything fit in. You managed to put everything in the suitcases. We're here to learn everything. Hey. Hey. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to. I'm going to. welcome home I love my god in 2016 during the first mandate of donald trump I said I want to leave but I was not able to do it financially me as a single mother my greatest concern is the good education and safety of my daughter this time while the elections are approaching my daughter and I have discussed what we were going to do if he won if he was no longer in phase with this new america chris and teresa therefore make the choice of leaving very far from california they called on barbara a french specialist in expatriation in barcelona it is she who found these three pieces in the center of life I won the big lot with barbara I could never have done it all alone where is the light oh it's so cute this room it's the first time she has her own room this is my bathroom and mine where is it over there in san diego chris was the owner of a beauty salon a single mother of the middle class confronted with inflation and the housing crisis it was impossible for her to offer her home to her children she was forced to leave her home to her daughter we had a foldable bed in the living room in order to rent something like that in the united states it would cost me 3500 see 4000 dollars in barcelona her rent is 2000 euros per month thanks to her savings and her pension chris hopes to improve her purchasing power compared to the united states a loaf of bread cost me six dollars i'm not even talking about meat or other more expensive products it's a simple piece of bread the same for the housing price trump had promised his voters to take care of it that everything would decrease but now that he is in power he does the opposite and it doesn't bother him to take people for idiots because they are idiots who put him in power in the first place so now before the sun is completely gone come and see before the sun is completely gone come and see before the sun is completely gone the terrace the terrace and the family sacred and the family sacred and the family sacred okay wait wait wait concretely i would say that i have two or three times more americans who ask me today than before since the election of donald trump especially in relation to how he conceives the rights of man and the way he wants to live today the united states is not for them the united states is not for them the united states is not for them the united states is not for them since november 5, 2024 since november 5, 2024 on the day of the re-election of donald trump the american society has never seemed so fractured the american society has never seemed so fractured direct consequences questions related to expatriation bondis of 1500% on the search engines on the search engines donald trump would be the trigger of a wave of departure of the exiters of the exiters of the exiters 15,000 to 24,000 15,000 to 24,000 their number tripled in portugal 15,000 people today and the ask for a spanish visa increase of 70% increase of 70% with 41,000 permanent residents with 41,000 permanent residents americans spain has become a privileged land spain has become a privileged land of single mothers and university students who settle in the country. But are all these Americans really welcome in Spain? For the moment, these new arrivals are not asking themselves the question. The Spanish have a priority, their quality of life, spending time with their families, with their friends. Everything is not about their career, while in the United States we have this reputation, culture, and culture. It is not about the job, it is about the family. It is not about the job, it is about the family. It is about the future of work above all. Here I am lighter. At 45 years old, Sipit Abibian is part of the American diaspora in Spain. It has been 10 years that she lives in this country, today in Malaga. Thank you. Goodbye. How are you, my darlings? You look happy to see me. This is not what I expected when I came to settle in Spain. I feel so lucky. Look at my view, the Mediterranean sea. I grew up in the suburbs, a typical American neighborhood. I have a very typical American life. I am a woman, I am a woman, I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. I am a woman. Sipit was a woman in the south of the Mediterranean. It is a typical American life. And pretty is not the word that I would associate with the environment in which I grew up. So it is very different from my home. In Austin, Texas, Sipit was working in human resources. Today, far from office life, she has become an influencer and coach for expatriates. There is not too much sun, let's go! Off to work. What can I say?

It's just like you put in light the fear, the discomfort, the uncertainty, everything I read, but I make it real. It just brings so much more meaning to the work I do. It's not just about wanting to travel and live in another country. It's really about realizing that now we're talking about safety. I'm really mixed. I wish the election results were different and my business was boosted for other reasons. While I'm living my best life here, it's not just the people I work with, my clients, but also my family and friends who live in the US who have to work with this new America. Ciao! Thank you! Bye! Like 15,000 other Americans, Vanessa Velasquez chose Madrid. Vanessa is a lesbian. She lived in Republican land in Texas. Her sexual identity is at the heart of her decision-making. Being gay in Texas was already in Paris. The rise in trans violence, anti-trans and homophobic violence, led to the election because a lot of people felt even more disinhibited. And I'm having to leave them because there's this situation that could be coming after my rights. What have I already put in the bag? After two months of stay in Madrid, she's only moving in this 15 square meters. It is actually a studio. I live in a attic. This is going to be my living room. And then I have this... There are a lot of things I have to manage. I had to take everything with me. It's not easy to reduce my old life to these little things. So I just took what was most important to me, essentially. So I felt a lot of sadness. Not because of abandoned objects, but more of leaving this country where I have so many memories. I have done my entire life. Vanessa is from a Colombian family. When I make a big dish like sudado de pollo and stuff, I have to put in some salsa to call my ancestors. My previous ancestors. They tell me how to dose the ingredients. And if I don't have music, it's inedible. I make a terrible dish. For her, speaking Spanish was essential in her choice of home. When I was little, we spoke Spanish at home. And I had a duty to continue to study at university. I had to learn to write music. I had to learn to write and write. I had a wonderful natürlich. And here is a typical Colombian breakfast. Everybody makes it. They have it for breakfast and food for dinner. I guess I probably should get a desk, I guess. Vanessa's parents arrived in the United States in the 1970s. I asked my mum for this picture. This was the picture that was on my desk. This is my dad. c'est mon père son père décédé aujourd'hui avait traversé la frontière illégalement à pied en quête du rêve américain 50 ans plus tard vanessa change de continent le passeport américain en poche elle a conscience de ses privilèges c'est fou quand je pense à mon père et à sa migration il n'avait pas de téléphone il n'avait pas accès à toutes les facilités auquel moi j'ai accès ça me rappelle sans cesse à quel point même si c'est difficile émotionnellement physiquement ou psychologiquement de migrer il faut continuer de s'accrocher j'avais oublié que j'avais cette photo j'étais tellement blonde incroyable il ya quelque chose d'ironique dans cette situation mes parents ont immigré aux états unis pour avoir une vie meilleure et moi aujourd'hui je fais la même chose je dois m'exiler en europe dans sa famille vanessa est l'une des seuls à avoir voté démocrate comment ça va maman t'as vu mon bordel ouais je vois ça sa propre mère fait partie des latino-américains soutien de donald trump jusque dans ses positions anti immigration nous n'avons rien obtenu gratuitement nous n'avons They have worked very hard to get there. Today, you have people who come to try to get everything for free. They don't even want to work. And that's why a lot of people say, enough, it's a little scary. You never know what will be done the next day. Yeah, mom, it's shit. A little bit. All right, love you, thanks mom. See you later. Okay, bye. It's always kind of weird. We have different views with my mom. It's always uncomfortable to talk politics. My mom and I have a good deal of it. So yeah, it's always a very delicate subject with other members of my family. Many members of my family. Uncles and aunts who were holding hands openly spoke homophobic and racist words. Leaving for Spain, Vanessa cut the ties. We have a family group, where there's like 30, 40 people. It's crazy. But I left this group because some things were being said and I thought it was not okay to say these things. And I felt more and more alone in my family. I think they loved me. Maybe they still love me. But as long as I don't say anything, I'm gay. It's conditional. I'm not choosing to be gay. I'm not choosing to be a woman. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. I am. It's a life of country. Also the few outside, Russi, she was born in New Orleans.ica New Orleans em區 80 But at the same time, it's so outrageous that I can't help but watch the news. It's almost like a movie. What will be the next twist? Teresa got a visa for Spain quickly because she comes to pursue her studies. This morning, she has to visit her new high school. You get on the bus and you put it in the machine. I think there are about 10 trips. The 17-year-old girl has never taken a bus alone. In San Diego, it's her mother who, morning and evening, drove her to high school. Tomorrow, I'll let her get on a bus alone for the first time to go to school. It's a little scary. But it's not a big deal. It's not something I was thinking about in the United States. I think it's here. In this international school, the classes are practiced in Spanish and English. Hey, welcome to Barcelona. Thank you. I'm so happy. Follow me. Hey, Logan. It's Logan from California, our science teacher. Oh, okay. Hello. Of the 340 students in the establishment, 60 are of American nationality. Yeah, I'm going to be... Yeah, I'm going to be... Yeah, I'm going to be... Yeah, I'm going to be... I'm going to be... Yeah, I'm going to be... Yeah, I'm going to be... I'm going to be... You stress? No, it's okay. I'm not stressed. Teresa is looking forward to discovering her new class, far from the violence that has destroyed her last years of school life. school in san diego in the united states schools are closed doors are locked in my old school there are at least three armed policemen who walk around the corridors from my first year there was a fire alarm we were completely locked up the police knocked down the doors the parents were alerted it was crazy to me it touches me deeply just to think about it I was terrified to tell me that I can send my daughter to school that she never comes home you know there is a reason why the doors are not locked at home for which there are no armed policemen it is because we do not need it here and I know that it is difficult to understand for you at first but soon you will realize that all this was not normal by making the choice of exile many American parents have been forced to leave the country for a long time to live in the country and to live in the country for a long time also seeks to escape a school system in the goal of the trump administration yes we have a lot of families who must still arrive at the beginning of september and many contacted me just after the election of trump when he was re-elected to ask me if he could come earlier I would say that there is an increase of about 40 percent of the number of families who try to come from the us but we are not able to welcome everyone you find yourself lucky yes of course the streets are so different from san diego yeah they are so much wider when they walk around town mother and daughter enjoy a simple pleasure flung in the streets of barcelona come on let me take a picture it's the arc of triumph but I don't know why he is here and not in paris it's like it's like we had removed a

Three months after her arrival, Teresa continued her discovery of Madrid, alongside new friends. Next summer, she will resume her studies in psychology. In two years, and thanks to her Colombian origins, she will be able to ask for Spanish nationality.
