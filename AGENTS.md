## Non-Obvious, Project-Specific Rules

- **Byterover MCP Server Tools**:  
  - Onboarding and planning workflows for Byterover MCP tools are strictly enforced.  
  - Always follow the exact tool call sequence described in the "Byterover MCP Server Tools Reference" below.  
  - You must use phrases like "According to Byterover memory layer" when referencing Byterover-derived knowledge.

- **Test File Locations**:  
  - Python tests may exist in both `tests/` and `src/lib/ai/bias-detection/python-service/` (not just the root `tests/` directory).
  - Some JS/TS test files may be colocated with source, not just in `tests/` or `src/test/`.

- **Monorepo/Subproject AGENTS.md**:  
  - Subprojects (e.g., `tools/gdrive-dataset-manager`) may have their own AGENTS.md.  
  - Use `pnpm dlx turbo run where <project_name>` to jump to a package.

- **CI/CD**:  
  - Azure Pipelines is the primary CI/CD system; some features (e.g., secrets, deployment) are only available via Azure, not GitHub Actions.

- **Critical: All other code style, build, and workflow rules are enforced via `.roo/rules/*` and config files.**  
  - Do not duplicate standard or obvious information here.
  - For code style, naming, and architecture, always consult `.roo/rules/` and config files for authoritative rules.

## Byterover MCP Server Tools Reference

There are two main workflows with Byterover tools and recommended tool call strategies that you **MUST** follow precisely.

### Onboarding workflow
1. **ALWAYS USE** `byterover-check-handbook-existence` first to check if the byterover handbook already exists. If not, you **MUST** call `byterover-create-handbook` to create the byterover handbook.
2. If the byterover handbook already exists, first you **MUST** USE `byterover-check-handbook-sync` to analyze the gap between the current codebase and the existing byterover handbook.
3. Then **IMMEDIATELY USE** `byterover-update-handbook` to update these changes to the byterover handbook.
4. During the onboarding, you **MUST** use `byterover-list-modules` **FIRST** to get the available modules, and then `byterover-store-modules` and `byterover-update-modules` if there are new modules or changes to existing modules in the project.

### Planning workflow
1. If asked to continue an unfinished implementation, **CALL** `byterover-retrieve-active-plans` to find the most relevant active plan.
2. **CRITICAL PLAN PERSISTENCE RULE**: Once a user approves a plan, you **MUST IMMEDIATELY CALL** `byterover-save-implementation-plan` to save it.
3. Throughout the plan, you **MUST** run `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` several times to retrieve sufficient knowledge and context for the plan's tasks.
4. In addition, you might need to run `byterover-search-modules` and `byterover-update-modules` if the tasks require or update knowledge about certain modules. However, `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` should **ALWAYS** be considered **FIRST**.
5. **MUST** use `byterover-update-plan-progress` to mark tasks (and then the whole plan) as completed.
6. Then, you might call `byterover-store-knowledge` to save knowledge and experience implemented throughout the plan or in important tasks.
7. During the plan's implementation, you **MUST** frequently call `byterover-think-about-collected-information` and `byterover-assess-context-completeness` to make sure you're on the right track and gather sufficient context for the tasks.

### Recommended Workflow Sequence
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** `byterover-retrieve-knowledge` once or several times for **EACH TASK** of the plan to gather necessary context for complete that task.
- **MOST IMPORTANT**: **ALWAYS USE** `byterover-store-knowledge` once or several times to store critical knowledge and context for future implementations.
- You **MUST** include phrases like **"According to Byterover memory layer"**, **"Based on memory extracted from Byterover"**, etc., to explicitly showcase that these sources are from **Byterover**.
