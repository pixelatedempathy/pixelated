Well, tonight is going to be the last night on relationships, and as you can see, it's all about how to end one.  Here are the questions that I get, and probably many of you have had.  I am married, number one, and how do I know if I should get a divorce or not?  Number two, I am dating, are there any guidelines that would help me know if I should end the relationship?  Because I am not convinced the guy's a jerk, but he's starting to look like one, so help me with that.  And number three, I am in a relationship that's been going for a long time as we have gone through addiction together, cheating together, all of that kind of stuff, even some abuse.  Can it be repaired?  Or do I just say, no, see you later?  Or in a relationship?  In a friendship type of relationship, so I am getting to know this person, and I have let them into my life, and now I am kind of second-guessing myself that maybe I should not have let them in so far.  Now what do I do?  Do I ghost them and walk away?  Do I try to push boundaries out a little bit and make it more of a casual friendship?  How do you do that, and what's the best way to go?  I get asked that a lot.  Bottom line is the issue is this.  In a relationship, should I fight for it or end it?  And that happens in all kinds of scenarios, from intimate romantic relationships to friendships, etc.  So that's what I want to look at.  Now to kind of set the stage in your mind, I just want you to think about how you have responded to relationship problems.  I want you to think about how you have responded to relationship problems in the past.  So some of you are excellent at one strike, you are out.  You hurt me, I ghost you, no second chances, not going to work at it, not going to try to repair it, it's done.  And that's how you have gone through adult life.  Others of you give way too many chances.  You let them hurt you, abuse you, cheat on you, and you keep taking them back.  So that's kind of one of two extremes.  A third scenario, and I get this one all the time.  Do you realize that people love to complain to me about their friend or their partner, but not do anything about it?  So they complain about what a jerk they are, and I go, well what are you going to do?  Are you going to set a boundary?  Oh no, I just want to complain about it.  And so that's a very normal thing.  Or they say, I am going to set a consequence, a boundary with this person.  I am going to do it.  So they announce a boundary and then never enforce it.  That's very common as well.  Or they set a boundary, enforce it for a little while, and then things start improving and they let the boundary disappear.  And it goes back to the way it used to be.  And that's a very normal thing.  Or, I do not like what you are doing, I am really mad at you, but I am not going to get rid of you.  I will just nag you, manipulate you, try to control you.  Because I am going to change you.  So there's a lot of that that happens.  Or, and the sad thing for most of those options are, you get so preoccupied with the flaws and the failures of the other person, you forget about yourself.  And before you know it, you are in a really bad place.  Because you have not been working on yourself, you have been working on them.  And so those are the scenarios that many people, most people, in recovery, have done in their relationships.  And I want you to think about a different way tonight.  So let me give you the criteria that I would present to a person.  So big picture, and we have talked about this.  A relationship can only get healthy and only grow if both people are working on it.  Both people have to be willing to own their stuff and change.  If only one person is working and the other refuses to, that relationship will not work or be healthy no matter how hard you try to work.  So that's just reality.

So, future of any relationship, when people come to see me, I am not just looking at, are you willing to own your stuff and change?  I am also trying to get a sense of, is the other person willing to own their stuff and change?  And what happens for a lot of people who are addicts is this.  You are in a relationship, you are an addict, it's obviously you are the messed up one.  And so you work on yourself, but the other person thinks, I do not need to change, they are the one that needs help.  And so you work on yourself, but the other person thinks, I do not need to change, they are the one that needs help.  And then issues start coming in the relationship, but they are still not willing to change.  They still want to make it, you are the sick one.  And so they twist everything to say, you are the problem.  And people hear that and think, maybe I am because I am an addict, blah, blah, blah.  And they stay in the relationship way too long.  So that is a very common thing.  So number one thing you got to do.  You need to know where to draw a line in the sand that says, if you cross this line, we are done.  And that line cannot just be that you do not dye your hair a certain color.  That's a dumb line.  It's got to be a line that's related to character.  So if you keep lying to me, we are done.  If you do not start growing up and accepting responsibility for things around here, we are done.  If you do not learn to deal with your anger and quit lashing out the way you do, we are done.  If you do not stop all your jealousy and manipulation and control, we are done.  So those are the kind of things you have to decide what is worth ending a relationship for.  What is a non-negotiable deal breaker?  That you need to be clear in your mind.  If the person you are with is doing that thing, part two then, is you talk to them.  And say, when you do this, it's keeping me from trusting you, from having a healthy relationship.  It is not loving.  So this has to change or here's the consequence.  So what will typically happen is they will want to change and they might change for a little bit and then slide back.  So then you have to begin to get straight in your mind.  Okay, change.  Okay, change is kind of messy.  So they might do well, slide back, do well, but they really want to change.  So they will keep working at it.  Or they might be a con man who changes for a little while and then goes back.  So that means number three, you got to leave long enough period of time to do the evaluation of whether they are really going to change.  So it might be in your mind, I am going to give this person three months, six months.  I have stated the boundary.  I have stated the consequence.  Now I will watch.  And then if they still do not change, then you enforce the consequence.  So that in my mind is kind of what you have to have clear in your mind so that you do not end up staying in this too long.  And here's why I say that.  The longer you stay in a sick relationship with a sick person, who is not willing to own their stuff, the sicker you become.  It wears you down.  It takes its toll on you.  So this is not just about getting rid of a jerk.  This is about protecting yourself and keeping yourself growing.  Okay, number three.  Some people will say, but I love them.  What I have learned over the years is there's a lot of definitions of love that are really bad misunderstandings of love.  So people think the loving thing to do is this, but that's really not a very loving thing to do.  So I want to give you five common misconceptions that people have that cause them to stay in relationships when it should have been ended a long time ago.  Number one.  Love means you make sacrifices for people.  You put your needs aside at times in order to meet their needs.  And you serve other people.  That is a wonderful definition of love.

But in an intimate relationship or a friendship, both have to be living by that definition.  If you are the only one making sacrifices and serving, and the other's not doing any of that, that is not love to continue in that.  Cause what you are doing is enabling them to stay immature and irresponsible and selfish.  And you are giving up all your needs and doing all the sacrificing.  That will eventually make you sick.  Second.  While love means humility, it means submitting yourself to another person and to another person.  And that's what love is.  It means submitting yourself to another person and their needs.  And what many people do not realize, that definition contains, love means becoming a doormat.  Love means letting people walk all over you.  Love means tolerating wrong, unloving, abusive behavior.  Love means not standing up for yourself.  Do you want to know what true humility is?  I do not think I am better than anybody, but I am not less than anybody either.  So I will stand up for myself if somebody wants to make me less than.  So love is not being a doormat.  Humility and love is, I stand up for me, just as much as I stand up for you.  Third one.  Many people have an idea that love is always syrupy, sweet, kind, just be nice to people, all of that stuff.  You never get angry.  You never get harsh.  That is very unloving in their mind.  I do not know if you have been a parent for very long, but if you are sweet to your kids constantly and you never have to be harsh or say no, then you are not probably a very good parent.  Because we all need a tough side to love.  If we do not have a tough side, we will just keep pushing the boundary to see what we can get away with.  And if you are still sweet and nice to us and cleaning up after us, we will begin using you and abusing you as long as you will put up with it.  So love has to have a tough side and a gentle soft side in order to be a whole package love.  Number four.  Many people think love means you never set boundaries.  So I remember early in marriage, once in a while people would show up at our door and just want to come in.  And I just had a busy day.  And I said, sorry, you cannot come in.  And my wife would go, you are being so rude and unkind.  I go, if I let everybody in, I will burn myself out.  So love is a tough side.  And I think that's what we need to do.  Love sets boundaries.  Love says, this is okay.  Outside of here is not.  And if you go outside of here, there will be consequences.  So I will not tolerate lying.  So to be a loving parent, you say to your child, if we are going to have a healthy relationship, there's going to be no lying.  So if you lie, there will be consequences.  And so love is fighting for boundaries that reinforce love.  And keep it healthy.  It has to have boundaries.  What happens for a lot of people is that they set boundaries in recovery and people break those boundaries and then they do not enforce the consequences.  So it's important to understand it's number one, necessary to set boundaries, but number two, it's just as important to enforce the boundary.  And that is where many people struggle because to enforce the boundary means I enforce a consequence for breaking the boundary.  And that leads many people to say, oh, I could not do that.  That would be too hard.  I might hurt their feelings.  And I just could not do that.  And I go, so what you are saying is you are going to let people walk all over you, use you and abuse you, and you are never going to stand up for yourself.  And what is loving?  So that is important.  And then the fifth misconception is forgiveness.  And what people think is if I forgive somebody who's hurt me badly, that automatically I just start trusting them again or I let them totally back into my life and I do not set any boundaries with them and I always give them more chances.  That is not forgiveness.  Forgiveness, if a person's hurt me badly, what forgiveness means is I am not going to take revenge into my own hands.

But that does not mean I am not going to set a boundary with you and not let you into my life again until I have ample evidence that you have changed.  Then I will let you in.  So forgiveness does not mean let everybody walk back all over you and act like nothing happened in the first place.  So those are common misconceptions.  So let me go to some facts about damaged relationships that I have seen over the last 15 years in my field as a counselor with people in addiction and from trauma.  So number one, a very common scenario for people in addiction is they cheat on each other.  And so I get couples all the time coming to ask me, my partner cheated on me, I cheated on them, can we make it work again?  And what I basically say is this, how long do you think it would take for you to trust them again?  If they are really working on themselves, how long do you think before you would be able to confidently trust them again?  And they stop and they, you can tell the wheels are turning and I will go make it simple for you, two to five years.  Maybe more realistically for some, ten years.  Because I say what will happen if in two years they phone from work and say I am going to be a bit late from work tonight, I got to stop at Walmart.  Where does your brain go?  They are not going to Walmart.  They got somebody on the side.  And I go that's after two or three years your mind goes there.  So you have to ask yourself, are you convinced both of you are committed to work on your stuff?  Secondly, are you willing to wait two to five years of working, working, working at a relationship with no guarantee it's going to work out?  That's the issue you have to decide.  Second scenario, I have had many occasions where there's two people in recovery that are both working on their stuff.  And they are growing a lot.  And then they get in a relationship and once in a relationship all their old stuff is triggered.  And now there's conflict and fight and hurt feelings and all of that.  And they come and see me.  And I will meet with them and I will try to process stuff and help them work it out.

But sometimes I come to this conclusion.  Both of you want to work on your stuff and I am convinced both of you are.  You just do not have the tools yet to work on the tough parts of intimate relationships.  So you can stay together but if you do not have the tools you are going to continue to create more baggage and do more damage.  So it's not that you do not want it to work.  It's not that you are not wanting to change and have a healthy relationship.  It's just that where you are both at right now in your growth you are incapable of that.  And that's not a judgment on you that should cause you shame.  It's just the reality of where you are in your own journey.  And so I say separate.  Work on your stuff.  Maybe you are going to revisit it down the road.

But if you stay together you are only going to make things worse.  Next one.  What many people do in recovery is they lose sight of the big picture and it goes like this.  If you come from complex trauma there's a good chance the person you end up with will also have some complex trauma.  So for this relationship now to work you got a couple of things.  You got to be working on your stuff.  That's a lot of work.  They got to work on their stuff.  Then you are going to have issues between you that you got to work on and resolve.

But then you got your baggage from the past that can get triggered by the relationship that's going to cause you to work on a lot of painful stuff from the past.  So for a relationship to work for to be from complex trauma you got a ton of things to be working on.  You got a ton of issues that can get triggered.  And you need to be aware of that.  Next thing.  Let's say you were in a relationship and you did draw a line in the sand and you ended it.  Then the other person came to you and they said I am so sorry and it looks like they are working on themselves and it will be different this time lots of promises they are going to meetings etc.  So you let them back in.  And then they mess up again.  And you kick them out again.  And then a few months later they come back begging and convinced that they are changed and everything's going to be different this time and you let them back in.  And that happens a few times.  Now.  Let's say they really have changed the tenth time.

But.  You let them in are you convinced they have changed?  You are going huh this could be like the other times.  And what is happening with them from the past is I just got to manipulate this partner of mine and they will let me back.  So if you let them back even though they are really wanting to change you are letting them think again that maybe their manipulation worked.  And so what I have seen happen is if somebody's manipulated their way back a number of times the chances of that relationship ever working are very small.  Because you will never be able to be convinced they have truly changed and they will still think their manipulation will work.  And so I say often to people you just have to separate.  Because you will never be able to sort it out if you get back together.  So those are hard realities.  So that leads to the next question.  How do I know if the person is really changing?  And here's the scenario it comes from.  And most of you have gone through this.  I call it crisis management.  You are in a relationship.  You have a big fight.  You boot them out.  Crisis takes place.  They say I will do whatever you want.  Just take me back.  So you take them back.  And guess what?  They are the most polite, considerate, sweet, sacrificing person until the crisis is past.  And then they slide back into old behaviors.  And so we all know from experience that people can change in order to get you to change the consequence but it's not genuine change.  It is change in a crisis to manipulate you to let them away with it.  So we have to develop criteria that takes that into consideration.  Because many people have been fooled by that over and over again.  Here's what I tell people.  The only way I would be convinced that somebody who's been abusive to me or has cheated on me has really changed is they cannot be in my life.  They got to want to change for themselves with no hope of ever having a relationship with me.  Because if they are changing in order to get a relationship for themselves with me, I cannot trust that change.  Because they are possibly just changing for all the wrong reasons and it's not genuine.  So the only way to be convinced is they got to be separate from me and they got to be committed to change on their own for themselves.  That is really the only criteria that will enable you to get a really accurate picture of whether the change is real.  And that's very, very hard to do.  Now let's say you want to do that.  Be ready for the comebacks that they are now going to have to try and get you to take them back.  So the first one, only you understand me.  I need you to help me because none of these other jerks out there know me well enough to help me.  And they will give you that sob story and make you feel like you are the greatest psychologist and counselor in the world and the only one that will work for them.  And you can get sucked into that.  Or they can go to, if you end this and kick me out, I will kill myself.  And then you go, I could not do that.  I would not want that in my conscience.  They just manipulated you.  And you cannot control what they do that way.

But if you let them back in, you are teaching them all they have to do to get their way is to threaten to kill themselves.  And you will fold.  And that is a dangerous precedence.  Or they might threat you physically.  If you get rid of me, you will be sorry.  I will make your life hell.  I will do all kinds of things to hurt you.  And the fear, causes you to take them back and give them another chance.  So you have to be prepared for that.  And then some, they will start texting you a billion times a day.  Sending you flowers.  Sending you poems they have written about their love for you.  Showing up at your work with roses.  All of those things.  Trying to wear you down.  Trying to get you to, give them an opportunity.  Now let me give you this.  And I have sadly seen it happen over and over again.  Many people from complex trauma are attracted to narcissists.  And narcissists is, I am the most wonderful thing in the world.  You adore me.  And you are lucky to have me.  And I own you.

So, you break up.  Well now you are making them look bad.  And they can never be made to look bad.  So they will manipulate, manipulate to let you back in.  Let's say you let them in.  You train them.  That manipulation gets you to change the boundary.  They mess up again, you kick them out.  And they manipulate their way back.  What you taught them was this.  Your no does not mean no.  It means try harder.  So now you really are determined to get rid of them.  Well you have trained them for years to keep manipulating.  So you have to be ready for a long battle of sticking to your guns.  Do not open the door a crack.  It has to remain sealed shut.  Before they get the message that there's no future here.  And that is hard to do.  So let me just end with some of the tough parts in ending a relationship.  If you have kids together, there's always the concern about the kids.

Let me say this.  For you to stay together, you hurt the kids.  For you to split, you hurt the kids.  There's no win-lose option.  They are both bad options.  What you are trying to decide is what's the best of the bad options.  And usually, it's the splitting up.  Staying together, kids pick up stuff that's never said, stuff that hurts them and messes them up.  And that's what you are trying to do.  It hurts them and messes them up.  And I deal with it all the time.  So do not let the kids be your only reason for staying if the relationship is really unhealthy.

Second, many people when they break up will say, can we still be friends?  And I just smile when they tell me that.  Because what they mean is, could we still go out for coffee once a week as friends?  And for many of them, what that means is, can we go out once a week and we are back on?  Then it will be twice a week, then I will be texting every day, and then it's serious again.  So some people, not many, some people are able to say, it's done, I will let you be friends, here's the boundaries.  Some are able to keep it that way, and some are able to keep it there, but not many.  And so for many people, it's done and not even friends.  Because they are not strong enough to handle coffee once a week.  It will suck them back in, because the emotions will all start up again, and before you know it, it's back on.  Third thing is, what I find in dealing with people is they want to end the relationship, but really they are afraid to end it.  So the reason they do not end it is fear.  All kinds of fears.  Number one, fear of being judged.  If you get a divorce, oh, what will all the people think?  So there's that fear.  Many are afraid of being alone.  They cannot stand being alone, but many are afraid that this is another failure in my relationship, my relationship life.  I may never get a relationship that's healthy.  That's scary.  And so there's a fear of never ending up in a healthy relationship.  And then many people say, I cannot break up because I will hurt their feelings.  So their concern is hurting the feelings of the other person.  So what I say to them, you would rather hurt your feelings about yourself than to hurt their feelings.  That is out of balance.  Yes, you might hurt their feelings.
