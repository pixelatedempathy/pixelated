# Pixelated Empathy Security Policy

Welcome to the fortress of Pixelated Empathy, where our code is so secure, even Alan Turing would need multi-factor authentication to get in. If you’re here to report a vulnerability, congratulations—you’ve found the one chink in our armor (or so you think).

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do the following:

1. **Do NOT open a public issue.**
   - We prefer our vulnerabilities like our deepest secrets: disclosed privately.
2. **Email us at [security@pixelatedempathy.com](mailto:security@pixelatedempathy.com)**
   - Use the subject line: `Security Flaw Discovered by [Your Name]`
   - Include:
     - A detailed description of the vulnerability
     - Steps to reproduce (screenshots, logs, or interpretive dance videos welcome)
     - Potential impact
     - Your contact info (unless you prefer to remain a mysterious hero)
3. **PGP Encryption:**
   - If you’re feeling extra paranoid, request our PGP key for encrypted communication.

We aim to respond within **48 hours**. If we don’t, assume we’re busy patching the Matrix or arguing about tabs vs spaces.

## Supported Versions

| Version         | Supported?         |
| :-------------- | :----------------: |
| `main` (master) | ✅ **Yes**         |
| `develop`       | ✅ **Yes**         |
| Anything else   | ❌ **No**          |




We only support the branches that matter. If you’re running code from a random fork, may the odds be ever in your favor.

## Security Principles

- **Zero Trust:**
  - We trust no one. Not even ourselves. Especially not ourselves.
- **Least Privilege:**
  - Permissions are tighter than a hipster’s jeans.
- **Encryption Everywhere:**
  - Data at rest, in transit, and in existential crisis.
- **Dependency Vigilance:**
  - We update dependencies more often than we update our coffee supply.
- **OWASP Top 10:**
  - If you find an OWASP Top 10 issue, you get a free virtual high-five (and a patch).

## Responsible Disclosure

We believe in responsible disclosure. If you report a vulnerability, we’ll:
- Thank you profusely (possibly with memes)
- Patch the issue ASAP
- Credit you in our Hall of Fame (unless you prefer anonymity)
- Not send Gilfoyle to mock your code (unless you ask for it)

## Hall of Fame

We maintain a Hall of Fame for security researchers who help us keep Pixelated Empathy bulletproof. Want your name here? Find a bug, report it responsibly, and bask in eternal glory.

## Security Tools & Practices

- **Automated Security Scans:**
  - We run `pnpm security:scan` and other tools so often, our CI/CD pipeline has trust issues.
- **Code Reviews:**
  - Every PR is reviewed with the precision of a Gilfoyle roast.
- **Secrets Management:**
  - `.env` files are sacred. Secrets are never committed. If you do, expect a strongly worded email.
- **HIPAA Compliance:**
  - For our mental health AI, we take privacy as seriously as our own sanity.
- **Audit Logging:**
  - Every suspicious action is logged. Yes, even yours.

## Final Note

If you’re here to test our security, bring your A-game. We eat vulnerabilities for breakfast and sarcasm for lunch. But if you do find something, we’ll treat you with the respect you deserve—unless you use tabs for indentation. Then all bets are off.

Stay secure, stay pixelated.
