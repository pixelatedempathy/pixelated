I do not know if it fits.  So let's quit.  All of that happens.  And then all of a sudden you do not have your way of medicating all your emotions.  And you start feeling guilt and sadness.  Some fear.  Some anxiety.  Wow, if this is what change does, I feel worse.  What was the point of changing?  And then, now you have got to grow up and be responsible.  You mean I have got to get out of bed every morning at 7?  And go to work?  And pay my bills on time?  What's up with that?

I want to go back to being that 10 year old again.  So what you begin to realize is this recovery and change is making more demands of you and calling for deeper commitments and becoming a responsible, reliable person.  And that can feel a little bit restrictive.  And we do not like that.  And then you are going to get your family or your friends that say we like you the way you used to be.  We do not like the new you.  And you get pushback.  You even get opposition.  You get them saying you think you are better than us now, do you?  And they give you all of that stuff.  Or after all we have done for you, now you do not want to hang around us because we are too sick?  Who do you think you are?  And all of a sudden, a lot of people are not liking your change anymore.  And so that's not a whole lot of fun.  And then if you come to React or Finding Freedom and listen to me, you realize I got a boundary issue.  So you say I am going to work on my boundaries and then you go, the reason I do not enforce my boundaries is because I got a shame issue.  Oh thanks Tim for telling me about a new level which is a new devil.  And so you just get through one level of issues and you find out you got six more issues that are connected to that.  And you go, when am I going to be done growing?  When am I going to be done dealing with this crap?  This is not what I call fun.  So you know what a lot of people do at that point?  They say I think the old life was better.  And they relapse.  What they do not realize is if they just hung in there, persevered for a little while, that line in the valley would start going up again.

But part of what can happen when it's going down so you change and now all these things are happening, you start to feel a little bit scared and hopeless.  That maybe this is not going to work.  You start to second guess yourself.  Did I make the right decision?  You get a little bit confused.  What is normal?  Am I doing it right?  Am I doing it wrong?  And so a lot of people think, you know what, it was a whole lot easier back the old way.  And so what I want you to understand, recovery is about change.  Change is hard.  Change has many unseen or hidden things that will jump out and bite us.  That all of a sudden make us wonder if the change was the right decision.  So what I am hoping as we go through this series is that you will realize, okay, I got to change just about everything.  When I change, I am going to feel good, then I am going to feel worse for a little while, but stick at it because it will begin to be worth it.  I hope that will just help you to have enough of a picture of what to expect that when it happens, you can say, okay, Tim said this is going to happen, hang in there and it will be worth it.  So I got thinking of, what's a good story in the Bible that talks about a realistic approach to recovery?  And I started going back in my mind to this book in the Bible that's right around the middle of the Bible called Nehemiah.  It's not one that gets read very often because there's lots parts of it that are like super boring, like really boring.

But, a while back, I was thinking about Nehemiah's story that is told and I thought, this is the perfect parallel to recovery.  So what I am going to do over the next few weeks is tell you about Nehemiah and kind of how his story parallels recovery.  And I hope you are going to find it very instructive but encouraging as well.  And just give you insight into your own troubles, your own struggles.  So Nehemiah lived 2,500 years ago and he lived around Jerusalem and his hometown was the city of Jerusalem in Israel.

But he was not living there at the beginning of the story.  He had been taken, captivity, and what had happened is the nation that conquered Israel had demolished the city.  And Nehemiah is the guy that came along, and started to rebuild the city and he started by rebuilding the walls.  What the parallel is, is that if you look at recovery, it's much what Nehemiah looked at.  He looked at a whole bunch of rubble.  Your life has come to rubble.  Everything has crumbled and fallen apart.  And a lot of people at the beginning of recovery stand and look at all of the rubble of their life, and they go, where do I begin?  This is a big, big job.  So your relationships lie in ruin, your job lies in ruin, your finances are in ruin, your health is in ruin.  Just about everything is in ruin.  And so recovery is all about rebuilding.

But you are rebuilding from a pile of rubble.  And so that's what we are going to be looking at with Nehemiah because it gives us a very detailed, involved explanation of the problems that he encountered.  And every problem that he encountered, we will encounter in recovery.  He's going to go through days where he gets external opposition.  He's going to go through days where his closest friends start to complain and become negative about him.  He's going through days where he's very discouraged, days where he's struggling, days where he's stressed, days where he's tired and overwhelmed.  All that we go through in recovery.  And so I hope we can learn from him a little bit about our recovery and gain some tools for going through successfully in recovery.

But I want to begin by giving you a little background about Israel.  Because Israel is a wonderful parallel to an addict in addiction.  So what Israel had done over the last thousand years of their existence is they got close to God and then they thought, you know what, the grass is greener on the other side of the fence.  We think we would be happier drifting away from God, doing our own thing.  So they drifted away and every time they encountered pain, negative painful consequences for bad decisions.  And so they would stay in the house, they would stay in those bad decisions until the pain got so bad, they go running back to God.  And then they go along with God for a while and they say, you know what, grass is greener and they drift away and do the same thing over and over again.  Sounds like many people in recovery.  They do well, things are going great and then they start slacking off, drifting, and before you know it, relapse and they stay there until the pain is so great they come back.  And they have this cycle, like Israel did, of drifting, pain, coming back, repeat, repeat.  And so what happened eventually, Israel got to a point where it did not want to come back.  They figured, what's the point?  We are too far gone.  And so at that point in time, this nation came in and conquered them because they are the weakest they would ever been.  Life looked the most hopeless that it had ever been because they were carried away as captives and slaves to a foreign country and it was a painful, desperate, hopeless-looking time of their existence.  And that's where we find Nehemiah.  So their time away in this foreign country as prisoners was a 70-year period.  And Nehemiah lived in that period and right near the end of that period, his brother comes to visit him.  And his brother has been down in Jerusalem.  He's gone back to Israel to check it out.  And so Nehemiah says to his brother, tell me what is going on back in Israel.  And so this is what it says.  My brother came to visit me.  He had just arrived from Judah, which is Israel.  I asked them about how things were going in Jerusalem and they said to me, things are not going well.  They are in great trouble and disgrace.  So this is kind of how you might describe yourself at a bottom.  The walls of Jerusalem have been torn down.  The gates have been destroyed by fire.  In other words, devastation everywhere.  Everything is a mess.  Everything looks beyond repair.  It looks hopeless.  And so now I want to watch, have you see what Nehemiah did next.  Because what you are going to see next is where recovery begins.  So recovery does not begin by doing stuff on the outside.  It begins by something happening on the inside.  And if you look at the 12 steps of AA or any 12 step group, what you are going to see in these initial things that Nehemiah did, you are going to start to see the first four steps unfolding in his life.  So the first thing that he does, it says, when I heard this, I sat down and wept.  In fact, for days I mourned and fasted.  He was so brokenhearted, he could not even eat.  And he cried for days.  I suspect some of you have been there.  You have been at a bottom.  You have seen the mess.  And you are brokenhearted.  And you just cry.

But you cry without a solution.  You cry with a sense of overwhelming pain and hopelessness.  And that's where Nehemiah begins.  By that deep, deep sorrow.

But then he turns it into a prayer.  And so you look at the 12 steps.  What's step one?  Powerless.  That's what Nehemiah was feeling.  What's step two?  I think I need a power outside of myself greater than myself.  I need some help here.  And so what does he say?  He says, I prayed, O God of heaven, who keeps his covenant of unfailing love with those who love and obey his commandments, listen to my prayer.  Look down.  See me praying night and day for your people Israel.  And many of you at your bottom have just begged God.  You have not had fancy words.  You have not wrapped it up nice and neat.  Like a neat little churchy prayer.  You just say, God, I am in a mess.  Please help.  I have heard that you are a loving God.  Please, I hope you are.  I need your help.  And out of that desperation, prayer is born.  Then the third thing that he does is significant.  It says, he turns his prayer from begging to saying, I confess that we have sinned against you.  And that simply meant, we have stepped outside of what you said was healthy.  We have been our own boss, done our own thing, even though it was very self-centered, even though it hurt other people.  We wanted to do what we wanted to do.  I own it.  I messed up.  Even my own family and I have sinned.  So he does not say, it's them that sinned, not me.  He says, no, I am part of that.  We have sinned terribly by not obeying your commands that you gave us through your servant Moses.  And he's saying this, we did it knowing how to live.  We did it knowing what was healthy, but we chose to live unhealthy.  We chose in the face of all of this information to say, I still want to do it my way.  And so what he is doing is accepting responsibility for his part.  He is looking at his side of the road.  Then he's saying, I am the problem.  He's not blaming.  He's not trying to minimize what he did.  He's not trying to rationalize what he's done.  He is saying, I did it and I am so sorry.  For the first time, many addicts come to this place where they truly repent.  And that does not mean just feeling sorry about what you did.  It's owning it and saying, I got to change.  I have to do this differently.

But there's a second part here that I want you to understand.  Step one, two, three.  I am powerless.  I need power greater than myself.  Step three, I am going to trust.  I am going to turn my will and my life over.  I am going to connect with this God.  I cannot do this on my own.  I need the help of other people, but I need a spiritual power as well.  And that's what Nehemiah was saying was this.  This is too big of a mess for me to fix on my own.  Now just imagine that Winnipeg was totally demolished.  Every house, every building.  And you were standing at Portage and Main looking at nothing but rubble.  And you were saying, where do I begin to rebuild this city?  Imagine how powerless you would feel.  Overwhelmed.  There's just so much work and I am just one person.  And Nehemiah is saying that very thing, but he's saying, okay God, I need you.  And I surrender to you.  And then he says, how can I know God's going to help me?  And I love this and I want you to get it.  Because a lot of you have prayed to God in the past and it did not seem like God did anything to help you.  And you are not sure whether you can trust Him again.  So here's what he says.  Please remember your promise.  So he's saying, I am hanging on to something you promised.  And your promise was this.  If you are unfaithful, which they were to me, I will scatter you.  So in other words, we are in enemy territory as prisoners of war.

But that's because you kept your promise.  So you were faithful to a promise.

But you also said, if we return to you and we repent and obey and live by your commands, then you will bring us back.  So you have kept part one of your promise.  Now I am trusting you.  I am trusting you to keep part two.  We are turning our hearts back to you.  Now please help us rebuild our lives and our city.  And he's hanging on to that.  In Romans 8, God says this.  That He will take everything in your life.  If you surrender to Him, He will take the bad, all the mess, and He will turn it into a positive.  That's His promise.  And so what you are doing in recovery is saying, okay God, I am not going to sit on the couch and just say, I trust you.  Do all, clean up the mess and rebuild the city.  I got to give it 100%.  I got to work hard.

But I cannot just work hard without your help.  And so we are going to work as a team now.  And I am going to trust your promise that if we surrender to you, you are going to help us rebuild this city.  And our lives.  And that is why I do what I do.  Because if it was just me trying to help addicts, I would be kind of stuck feeling.

But God has said, if you will surrender, I will take all the bad stuff that you have done, all the mess you created, and it's going to be painful and it's going to be hard, but I will gradually turn that into positives in your life.  And I have watched it happen.  Now it does not mean all of a sudden, everything's magically fixed.  And that you do not have any consequences to deal with.  There's still consequences.

But he turns in the consequences, he changes you.  Does not necessarily change all your external circumstances.  He starts by changing who you are.  And that's where the healing has to begin.

So, Nehemiah prays.

Now, what he was, is he was the cupbearer for the king of Persia, which is modern Iran.  And to be a cupbearer, that meant that you tasted everything the king drank.  So if anybody tried to poison him, who died?  The cupbearer, not the king.  So the king would only pick to be his cupbearer, his most trusted friend in the world.  So what you see is Nehemiah, he was a super big shot in Iran.  Now he gets this report from his brother about Jerusalem, where he, that's his nationality, that's where his parents lived.  And he wants to help out.

But what does he do?  He cannot just go to the king one day and say, I quit.  He could get killed for that, believe it or not, in that culture.  So he prays.  For four months.  He sits there saying, God, I want help, but I am not sure the next step.  I am not sure where to begin.  So it says, early the following spring, I was serving the king his wine, and I had never appeared sad in his presence before.  Do you realize that in that culture, you had to be happy all the time in front of the king?  If you were sad or angry, he could have you executed.  That's what he did.  And so Nehemiah is so overwhelmed by the mess in Jerusalem, that he says, that he cannot even bring himself to be happy that day.  That's how overwhelmingly painful his emotions were.  And some of you get that.  And so he comes on the job, and he's sad, and the king says, what's wrong with you?  And immediately he kind of panics.  Because you are not supposed to do that, and he utters a very quick, quiet prayer and says, God help!  And he tells the king all about the mess in Jerusalem.  And the king says, I want you to go and help.  I will even pay your way to go and help.  I will even provide materials to start building a wall.  And I will send a bit of the army to keep you safe.  Because you are going to be in a war zone.  And you are going to need safe keeping.  So I will protect you.  Imagine Nehemiah sitting there going, wow.  How did that just happen?  Is it odd or is it God?  And that's what many of you have gone through.  These weird coincidences.  That out of the blue, something opens up.

But what I like about this was, Nehemiah had to sit for a little while.  There was not an instant fix for the problem.  He had to go and just wait.  And we do not like that.

But then once he gets there, the first thing he does, and this is your step four, is I arrived in Jerusalem and three days later I slipped out during the night.  That's because there's enemies everywhere.  And I went all around the city inspecting the wall.  And what he was doing was this.  I cannot begin recovery unless I know the damage.  I cannot begin recovery unless I know what the problems are.  I cannot begin recovery unless I know what needs to be done.  I cannot begin recovery unless I do an inventory.  I cannot begin recovery and expect to succeed unless I diagnose the problem correctly and diagnose the solution correctly.  And that's what we are doing in this series.  And that's what Nehemiah did.  So let me say this.  One of the things Jesus said was this.  Do not go into battle unless you counted how much it's going to cost you.  And what he is saying is just do not go in there with this fantasy in your mind saying, I am going to go into battle and I am going to be a knight in shining armor.  Nothing bad is going to happen to me.  Everything will be fine, wonderful.  It will be a lot of fun.  Jesus is saying get real.  Realize when you take on a task what it's going to require of you.  And that's what Nehemiah is doing.  He says I want to rebuild this city but I got to figure out exactly what needs fixed.  How much material is needed.  How much manpower is needed.  How much time it's going to take.  All of the obstacles.  All of the things that are going to become part of making this happen.  I got to get it figured it out.  Because if I do not, we are all going to start with lots of enthusiasm.  And then as soon as it starts getting hard, we are all going to quit.  Because we did not count the cost.  And so recovery begins with a hard attitude.  I need you God.  I surrender.  I trust you.  And then it goes to an inventory.  What's this going to cost?  What's this going to take?  I need a realistic road map.  Because if I do not, I am setting myself up to fail.
