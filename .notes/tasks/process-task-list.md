# Only Run When Working On Task Lists

**DO NOT** call on Ollama Overlord for every little task/job you do.
**ONLY CALL** when working through a specific task list, with items you can/must actually check [x] off.

## Task List Management

Guidelines for managing task lists in markdown files to track progress on completing a PRD

## Ollama Overlord
baseURL = https://api.pixelatedempathy.com
Call and ask for granite3.3:2b
Share your update, and ask for permission to continue moving forward

## Ollama Overlord Check-in Protocol

- After completing each sub-task, the agent MUST:
  1. Run the unified check-in script: `node scripts/ollama-checkin.mjs "Task completion summary"`
  2. Provide a clear, concise summary of what was accomplished in the completed sub-task
  3. The script will automatically:
     - Contact the Ollama API using the granite3.3:2b model
     - Request improvement suggestions and a continue/stop decision
     - Parse the response and display formatted results
     - Return appropriate exit codes based on the decision
  4. Based on the script's exit code and output:
     - **Exit code 0 (‚úÖ APPROVED)**: Proceed to the next sub-task
     - **Exit code 2 (üõë BLOCKED)**: Stop and address concerns before continuing
     - **Exit code 3 (‚ö†Ô∏è UNCLEAR)**: Manual review required - ask user for guidance
  5. If improvements are suggested from Ollama Overlord, add them to a running list located at .notes/tasks/tasks-proposed.md
     - Place them in a grouping of the same name as that task you checked in with Ollama Overlord for.
     - If any of them stand out as AWESOME suggestions for the project, denote them with **AWESOME** formatting.
- The agent MUST NOT proceed to the next sub-task without receiving approval from the script.

### Script Usage Examples:
```bash
# After completing a linting task
node scripts/ollama-checkin.mjs "Fixed all TypeScript eslint errors in 5 components"

# After implementing a feature
node scripts/ollama-checkin.mjs "Implemented user authentication with JWT tokens and session management"

# After writing tests
node scripts/ollama-checkin.mjs "Added comprehensive unit tests for the payment processing module with 90% coverage"
```

### Best Practices for Task Summaries:
- Be **SPECIFIC** about what was accomplished with metrics and details
- Mention the **EXACT** scope (number of files, components, lines changed, etc.)
- Include **TECHNICAL VALIDATION**: "Fixed all 15 TypeScript errors", "Resolved 8 linting warnings"
- Report **QUALITY METRICS**: "Added tests with 90% coverage", "Improved performance by 30%"
- Note any **REMAINING ISSUES** honestly (the Overlord will evaluate overall progress)
- **AVOID VAGUE** statements like "implemented feature" or "fixed some issues"
- Keep it concise but **COMPREHENSIVE** (2-3 sentences with specific details)

**Quality Standards:**  
The Ollama Overlord evaluates work with a balanced approach - focusing on functional progress while suggesting meaningful improvements. Critical showstopping issues will result in rejection, but functional implementations with room for enhancement are approved with constructive feedback.

**Note:**  
- This protocol uses the unified `scripts/ollama-checkin.mjs` script for all API communication with the Ollama Overlord
- The script evaluates work fairly, approving functional progress while providing valuable improvement suggestions
- The script is cross-platform compatible (Windows, macOS, Linux) and provides consistent behavior
- The script provides clear exit codes and formatted output for easy integration
- The agent should log each check-in command and response for traceability

### Task Implementation
- **One sub-task at a time:** Do **NOT** start the next sub‚Äëtask until you ask the ollama overlord for permission and they say "yes" or "y"
- Address linter errors and warnings as they appear.
- **Completion protocol:**  
  1. When you finish a **sub‚Äëtask**, immediately mark it as completed by changing `[ ]` to `[x]`.  
  2. If **all** subtasks underneath a parent task are now `[x]`, also mark the **parent task** as completed.  
- Stop after each sub‚Äëtask and wait for the user's go‚Äëahead.
- Always stop before marking complete and do a second look over your work, and clean up any linter errors or warnings.

### Task List Maintenance

1. **Update the task list as you work:**
   - Mark tasks and subtasks as completed (`[x]`) per the protocol above.
   - Add new tasks as they emerge.

2. **Maintain the "Relevant Files" section:**
   - List every file created or modified.
   - Give each file a one‚Äëline description of its purpose.

### AI Instructions

When working with task lists, the AI must:

1. Regularly update the task list file after finishing any significant work.
2. Follow the completion protocol:
   - Mark each finished **sub‚Äëtask** `[x]`.
   - Mark the **parent task** `[x]` once **all** its subtasks are `[x]`.
3. Add newly discovered tasks.
4. Keep "Relevant Files" accurate and up to date.
5. Before starting work, check which sub‚Äëtask is next.
6. After implementing a sub‚Äëtask, update the file and run the unified check-in script with a clear task summary.
7. Wait for script approval (exit code 0) before proceeding to the next sub-task
