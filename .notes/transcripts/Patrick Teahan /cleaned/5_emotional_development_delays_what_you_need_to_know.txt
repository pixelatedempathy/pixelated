So as a parent and a clinician and actually a former child care worker, in my private practice, I kept noticing similarities in my adult clients who went through childhood trauma really get stuck in very like normal developmental stages that children are going through and sort of like in terms of like milestones.  And well, if those kids are actually sort of safe with healthy parents and they are assisted to go through those changes.  And what that looks like is for adult childhood trauma survivors tend to really struggle compared to certain milestones in our adult lives with that of our peers, that they do not seem to struggle with things as much as maybe we do.  And I think that everyone has issues in some ways, but some more so than others, especially if they were raised in neglect and abusive parenting.  There are just basic things that usually got skipped and missed in a childhood trauma survivor's life that they may need to overcome later on.  And so I think that's a really good way to look at it.  And when we do not grow up in safety with healthy parents who are focused on our development in a good enough way, we get stuck and stop developing until something shifts in our hearing work later on.  Many survivors, including myself, had felt really behind compared with our peers in terms of things like career, relationships, functioning, like basic functioning, self-care.  And I personally felt that in my own life all the way from first grade through college.  I just did not feel like I got the handbook in life.  And noticing these differences with our peers can really make us like want to hide or overly compensate in our adult lives or feel really lonely in seeing the differences with our peers.  And it's really important for you to not go to that shame place when we are discussing this stuff and looking at that stuff or in general.  So I liken developmental delays if you have ever started a new job where management just expects you to perform flawlessly without giving you any training or a process of learning the ropes.  Like you are just thrown to the wolves.  Like that could have been our childhood.  And that's really about management's failure, not yours.  Same with being neglected growing up, which is a form of abuse.  And the normative challenges and milestones that children go through in terms of security and to functioning, to being able to relate in healthy ways, that's what comes with helping a child develop.  And ideally, as we grow from infancy all the way through college, we hopefully mature.  We become more secure, more self-actualized, and more well behaved.

But things do not really go according to that plan if our early years are marked with things like neglect and stress and abuse and trauma.  So it's entirely expected and understandable for childhood trauma survivors to get stuck in some developmental stages and challenges.  And none of that is a personal choice or moral failing.  I just want to be clear about that.  So here are actually five examples of what it looks like to get developmentally stuck.  And again, there's no moral failing within that.  Out of these five, you will see that many of them over time, I think, are not going to be the same.  So I am going to start by just looking at the first one.  So here are the first two.  So the first one is what I am calling a codependency and romantic intimacy delays.  Young children are naturally codependent, to believe it or not.  They want the upset to go away, and they only want to see good in parents and see kind of good in the abusers, which is a good adoptive survival strategy.  In here, I am really talking about young children, like before the age of sort of 10.  So a four-year-old will be terrified that connection is severed with an angry or aloof parent.  So they often come up with really good attempts to appease the parent or please a parent to reestablish or make that connection.  Even if it consistently fails, they are still going to try.  Even if it means just to be more tolerable to the abusive parent.  That's how powerful this stuff is.  We can have a significant emotional developmental delay in getting stuck in that codependency, or adulthood, where we have the same kind of relational strategy.  Here are some examples of what these delays will look like in our adulthood, and try to make the connection of these being childlike.  Try not to think of them as childish, because again we are going to self-shame ourselves.  Try to see the delay in these related to our development.  So here are some examples of this codependency thing in adults.  Magical thinking about a person or relationship changing without taking any action, like say going to couples therapy.  Believing that there was a special bond or a fantasy with their partner which does not match the reality of what it is.  Like that's not real intimacy.  And some survivors have a parent who actually lived in fantasies with an abusive co-parent, if you can think of that.  Another example is struggling with going too fast in dating life, which can really create problems.  The delay is that children do not like a process of getting to know someone slowly and they want things to be more immediate.  Another is not liking to mix partners with friends for fear of losing the partner, like an insecurity thing.  Like we did not have full access to say the caregiver that we were attached to, so you can see the security issue and projection of childhood trauma stuff happening in the present from an insecure place.  Another example is not caring if our partners are actually abusive for fear of being wrong, or being in a relationship we are not a good match for.  I mean maybe we stay out of fear of being alone.  It's another example of the codependency delay here.  Another example is a level of need from our partners that goes beyond appropriate partnership stuff.  And again, this is strongly related to the next issue of security where the delay here is not really being secure to ourselves.  Another is taking normative bumps in the relationship as extreme evidence that you are not safe.  The delay going on here is that this all or nothing kind of thinking that children can often go to.  It's like, I am never talking to you again kind of stuff.  That one is tricky because sometimes we actually are in an abusive relationship and we will need some outside help kind of figuring that out.  We really do not like it if someone is trying to tell us to just chill, especially if we are in the middle of a big trigger.  To get unstuck in this developmental delay, survivors can actively educate themselves on codependency and work a program of recovery around it, such as with Al-Anon or CODA.  And doing some inner child based work is highly beneficial.  It's also very powerful to do inner child based work.  I think that's one of the things that we are really looking at in our work.  We are looking at how to do inner child work where we are bonding with our inner child who is seeking rescue outside of ourselves.  So it's really about strengthening the bond between our inner adult and our inner child to start to create that security that's missing.  The missing piece in this codependency thing in terms of a healthy development in childhood is that we want our children to be both capable of intimacy, but also be self-sufficient in terms of security and self intimacy.  Like I mentioned, they can self soothe and they can also see their good side.  And that's what we are trying to do.  So we are trying to do inner child work where we are bonding with our inner child who is seeking meet in a Instagram story, analyst or whatever, which that way is going to go.  That way we can help them to meet their kinship enfin or we can also help people with emotionally things closer when they are doing the work.  The sense that things are buyed by the Royal Family is really important, and that sexual Анд Development can be the essense to share that and give often good feminine love Sister SEO, thank you for your questions.  You can find the link of that JavaScript girls group in the description.  And go sign it up, share it with your friends, spread the word.  And what we are tried to get out with the words of thank you for, thank you for, thankぎ you even had to come up with that quote because it's quite powerful, especially when you are in comfortable relationships where we are talking about, you know, oh, my wife, you know, consistent, safe attunement with a healthy parent to build inner resources for security.  A good example of that inner security is the gradual withdrawal of security blankets or sucking one's thumb, or gradually, like in later school years, like in sort of, you know, grammar school years, to not be so dysregulated as a child without like a beloved stuffed animal.  And these security transitional objects are all part of a healthy childhood, but there are often signs of security problems when children age and they cannot let go of those things.  They get stuck into like a transitioning from childhood to adolescence and on into adulthood.  To share a little bit on that, I had this pillowcase blankie thing forever, and I sucked my finger way longer than what is actually recommended.  I was sort of doing it into the third and fourth grade when it's recommended that the cutoff of that stuff is usually like around five or six.  I feel actually grateful for having sort of the blankie and all that, kind of going on, given what was going on around me in my childhood.

But it would also bring a lot of negative attention from people that felt very shaming, like why is he still doing that when he's in the third and fourth grade?  It was not, it was a red flag to other people, but not within the family.  So when children are neglected and grow up in abuse, the need for external security is greater, which is beneficial since they are not getting any help from the adults.

However, as we grow into adulthood, we can get stuck in living from an insecure place, and this is what they are doing.  So I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, that looks like.  We can be really resistant to change, like fear of the unknown as a security issue.  We can get into some big procrastination problems, which is fear of maybe criticism or failure, can be more complex than that at times.  We can have a lot of social anxiety or go into social situations and feel anxious without an anchor, like a safe person with us at the work party or the work event.  We can actually have some controlling behaviors, like getting to places on time can be a security issue.  So I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, and I think it's a good and also a trigger and a projection.  We can get into something called mood-dependent behaviors, like I will quit smoking when I feel better.  It's like I need to be secure in this one area before I move into this next thing.  Security can also look like intimacy and social problems, like not being comfortable being seen or not being comfortable being known.  Another example is living in fear mostly as opposed to living and having some spontaneity in life.  All of those are examples of security issues.  So I think it's a good idea to have that kind of a blankie, issues in my mind.  And these security issues, I am not trying to say they are solely related to blankies or stuffed animals or sucking our thumb.  They are really related to children not having a safe home base and a healthy parent from which they can also kind of, you know, they can always return to, they can always like talk with and feel more secure.  That's where the security stuff really comes from.  And it's difficult to see peers move more freely in the world than we can.  And they can maybe weather breakups better or job changes better.  And they do not go so much into their head about, say, planning or expectations from an insecure place.  Security delays are greatly improved with inner child work.  And it feels like to the inner child, there's a new safe home base coming from our inner adult within that reparenting work.  And that's a process of really rebuilding a relationship with our inner child.  And I think whatever the healing modality is going on there, I think about it as a process of really rebuilding a relationship with our inner child.  And I think whatever the healing modality is going on there, I think about it as a inner child work, especially with helping the inner child let go of something as you can picture, say, a monkey clinging to a branch or an animal clinging to a branch.  And there's a deep, there's a big fall going on.  They are hanging on for dear life.  In inner child work, we need to help that inner child.  We cannot just demand that they let go of the thing that helps them feel secure, like, you know, getting to places on time or whatever.  We cannot like just take that away from them.  We have to like let them grab on to another branch.  And that's what we are doing.  We have to let them grab on to another branch to feel more secure, which is either us or an idea or something like that.  So what I am trying to say with that analogy is we cannot just say, poof, stop doing that thing and just let go.  That never really works.  We have to replace it, something that the child can feel some trust in, and that is maybe the inner adult.  Moving on to the next one, which is a big one, which is called perception problems delays.  Problems of perception, i.  E.  How we interpret people in the world, how ourselves, this is really a top tier childhood trauma symptom of problems of perception.  Growing up in abuse, often the abuse itself is a parent damaging a child's perception because the adults have all the power over reality, which is scary.  Perception delays are not unlike seeing a preschool age child intensely assume that someone did something on purpose.  Many adult childhood trauma survivors can get stuck still assuming things are done on purpose.  Sometimes they are, but we can really see our peers not get so bogged down in taking things personally, regardless if they are actually offended and someone is a jerk or an idiot or if someone is harmless.  I hope that makes sense.  Survivors, due to those perception delays, really get into fights in their head, and the offense, real or imagined, stays with them.  And I am saying this from experience here, where we perceive the person really having an issue with us or really making it about us, but it's probably about the other person.  You have probably heard that before.  It's not about the other person.  It's about the other person.  It's about the other person.  It's about the other person.  It's about the other person.

But what's tricky about this is often in the toxic family system growing up, things were highly personal.  Or if we are still engaged in that family system, they can be highly personal.  So it's tricky for survivors to embrace thinking differently about the world and not take things so personally, but it is possible over time.  Essentially, when we have a toxic parent, a child is whatever the parent says they are.  In addition to a toxic parent, they can have problems of perception on their own, such as like, oh, I do not know, like everyone's out to get me, or I am better than everyone else, or no one gets how hard it is for me.  Those are all perception issues that we can kind of absorb or react to or kind of reject.  Survivors can, again, they can rebel against those or take them on.  Both become extreme distortions of perception though, such as when a survivor never wants to seem like they are superior to others for having a parent who lived in that in an immature and grandiose way.

But that survivor might never be able to see that as a person.  So it's a very, very difficult thing to do.  And I am going to go ahead and wrap up here.  I am going to go ahead and wrap up here.  I am going to go ahead and wrap up here.  I am going to go ahead and wrap up here.  I am going to go ahead and wrap up here.  Never really take themselves seriously and they will stay small.  They will be humble because if they perceive, they might kind of perceive that all self-positivity is grandiose unconsciously.  I got this course called The Family Rules that I offer.  Here are some additional examples of abusive perception coming from an abusive family system.  These are like unspoken or sometimes spoken family rules, such as it's your fault things go wrong.  It's like a problem of perception.  Expect unreliability from people.  Again, it's a problem of perception.  It's a problem of perception.  It was probably correct in childhood, but we might sort of like overly think people are going to let us down.  I know I did.  Perception problem.  Read my mind.  Coming from the family system was a huge perception problem.  Do not trust.  Again, probably very true in childhood, but in our adulthoods, we can have a perception problems around who is trustworthy and who is not.  In addition, while not in the family rules, from a toxic parent, there's usually like you are a terrible kid and I cannot believe you just did that.  That's usually kind of a vibe around definitely abuse around perception, like you are bad.

But there's also kind of a developmental issue there is a toxic parent expects adult behavior from a child, which is, again, another perception problem and a developmental problem.  The developmental delay here is that adult survivors struggle is not seeing their own humanity as well as the humanity in others.  And the perception delay usually makes us go to a big place where we are convinced we have done something wrong with our lives.  And we are not seeing our own humanity.  And we are not seeing our own identity.  And it's not true.  We are convinced we are the only one with problems.  We can be convinced that speaking up is wrong or dangerous or even lame.  We can be convinced that everyone is doing so much better than us when maybe that's not true.  We can be convinced that we are the only one with problems.  We can be convinced that we are the problem.  Can you see the perception delays as something that those are childlike?  And you probably identify with some of those yourself.  And you may also really know people in your adult life who might behave from that, as well, or think from that place as well.  Childlike, not childish.  Childlike because they got stuck in childhood.  Again, and that's not a moral failing.  So survivors can view themselves as a horrible person when they are not.  And they can also view others as angelic when that's not maybe true either.  So helping out an inner child with the perception delay, which will also involve some critical thinking from the inner adult, is helped when the inner adult has some resources to bounce questions off of, such as with the therapist or with a fellow survivor.  What I mean by that is like, I am feeling like this was done on purpose.  Can I run that by you about something that somebody did?  Or, you know, such as also going to that person and kind of saying, am I totally defective or did I make a mistake?  Are all humans predators or do I project and look for evidence that they are all predators?  Again, did they do that on purpose or does my inner child live in people's bad intentions and only look for that?  So additionally, while fact-checking and bouncing things off of somebody, it sounds kind of like cognitive and almost like cognitive behavioral therapy where we check out our assumptions.  Childhood trauma survivors need something deeper than that, processing where these assumptions come from in childhood trauma.  Cognitive stuff only takes us really so far when we need a deeper processing of our childhood-stuck emotions and situations and relationships with abusive parents.  Functioning delays are essentially the evidence of parental neglect, misbehavior, and misbehavior.  So we need to be able to understand what's going on in our childhood and not to be confused with things like learning problems or neurodivergence.  So many childhood trauma survivors, including myself, often had to hide that they struggle with basic learning skills due to a lack of consistent care from a parent who is supposed to be helping them have some mastery over some basic skills.  Some examples.  I have had several clients, actually several of them, tell me that still in their 30s or 40s, they still need to hold out their hands like this to decide which ones to let go.  And I have had a lot of clients who have had to let go of their hands and decide which ones to let go.  And I have had a lot of clients who have had to let go of their hands and say, which one's the left one, which one's the right one, because they had to come up with that on their own.  Or somebody helped them at school with that.  And it's like the habit has stuck.  And I have also had clients tell me that they assume that they can get through their day with only one or three hours of sleep from staying up late or believing that two hours of work can maybe happen in 20 minutes.  So some magical thinking there around functioning.  Here are some other specific examples related to functioning delays and neglect.  Fear of how your handwriting looks You might get anxious writing out a check or signing something for fear of doing it wrong.  That kind of makes me wonder about neglect.  Hiding that you still do not quite understand how something works, such as making like a doctor's appointment or how a deductible works.  Maybe that's a bad example because I still struggle with understanding how a health insurance deductible works.  Another is not knowing how to bring something up in conversation to like knowing how filing taxes work.  Not taking in that the check engine light is coming on or that you should maybe be concerned about that.  And again, this is not criticism.  These are sort of things that come with neglect.  I know that these things seem embarrassing, but functioning delays are real and they can also be complicated by symptoms of depression and dissociation, where it's difficult to cut through the fog to function better.

So, and we can grow out of these over time, but they are not to be confused with like, say, just being young and inexperienced.  Like, a check engine light is coming on or that you should maybe be concerned about that.  And again, a teenager might ignore a check engine light out of just being a teen, not knowing what that means.  Hopefully not, but the functioning issues are not all black and white and only related to neglect.

However, while these can be seen as, say, human mistakes, there can also be a childhood trauma story underneath them, such as being raised by a very limited parent, say, like someone struggling with mental illness or a hoarder who had their own functioning problems.  I find that those raised in that can be like over-functioning, which is another problem of the functioning delay.  The functioning delay in context is a combination of neglect and the child's tendency to think in terms of magical thinking or being wrapped up in fear.  They never really had a parent to help them with basics in the day-to-day parenting work of helping them with homework or preparing something or getting a child's resources, getting them resources like, say, a school tutor or helping them learn how to even wash their hands.

So, it's a combination of neglect and the child's tendency to think in terms of their hair with shampoo.  I have had many clients actually show their neglect when they would come into my office not dressed for the weather.  Like, they might come in with flip-flops and a nice storm, and that might make me curious about their awareness of self-care or preparing, that kind of stuff.  And chances are, knowing their story is they were profoundly not cared for, so why would these things matter to them?  Functioning delays are often evidence that someone does not really care much about themselves.  We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parents.  We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parents.  We kind of treat ourselves the way we were parented.  I have also had clients have some magical thinking about over-functioning, like I mentioned, where they have a deep childlike belief that they may not need much sleep or eating or resting, and they can get so much done in a day without taking in that there's the limitations to the human body.

So, I find that these things come from the child really being on their own in childhood, having to navigate school or community or basics such as hygiene.  And as adults, we can have a lot of shame and difficulty in our adult lives due to the fact that we are not able to do anything.  We can have a lot of shame and difficulty in our adult lives due to not fully knowing that how much sleep we need to get or how to do a budget.  We can also have a deep shame about, say, learning disabilities and delays that we had to hide, and we still believe we really cannot meet those delays head on.  In the third grade, I was in danger of being kept back for having problems with reading comprehension.  And at the same time, I discovered that I loved comic books, and I started reading these comic books, which had less complex dialogue, and they had correlating pictures, that would help me understand what was going on more.  And that's what actually proved my reading on my own.  I was even keeping it all kind of secret.

But that's what I mean.  Also, developmental delays would also get you into trouble more if you talked about them.  And later in therapy, I would really realize the level of neglect and the kind of help that I really kind of needed.

So, working on the functioning delays are very possible.  From an inner child work perspective, our inner adult is often in need of a resource, to learn how to overcome some things, such as getting somewhere on time, or getting support from someone like a therapist or fellow survivor who gets it.  And by resources, YouTube, I love it.  It's a good example, is, you know, if I went on YouTube, I can learn about budgeting.  I can learn how to read more books instead of being on my phone all the time.  I can learn how to contribute better to a conversation by being more an active listener.  That's what I mean by resources, and thank God for those, really.  Think like how-to in terms of those.  And it's hard to admit that we do not really know how to write a check, or we get anxious around writing a check, or that we cannot ask for directions, which is also a security thing.

But if we hold our neglectful parents accountable, we can sidestep a lot of that shame, because the accountability is definitely warranted.  And sidestepping that shame helps us to be able to learn things on a deeper level.  We really cannot learn things if we are overwhelmed with shame.  Working with our inner child on the functioning delay is really letting them know that they did not get what they wanted.  And that's what I mean by resources.  They did not get what they needed growing up to be successful.  And to help them with that level of shame, as well as your inner adult actually working on the functioning piece, which is where the resources come in.  I would recommend starting small on something before tackling bigger stuff, smaller functioning stuff.  Reminding yourself that, of course, you struggle with these things due to what happened to you growing up is going to, again, help combat that shame.  Last one here is negative coping strategies delay.  While it might be hard to see addictive behaviors as developmental delays, I see them as really closely related.  As children growing up in abuse, we often found things before and after puberty that would help us to address pain.  As adults, we can be developmentally stuck in needing to be soothed from behaviors.  Instead of having internal resources to manage them, we should be getting that from a healthy system.  Here are some examples.  A teen can find that looking physically perfect or attractive as a way to deal with their own mental health is a very difficult thing to do.

So, if you are a teen, you can find that eating is a way to help them feel okay and battle insecurity.  A teen can also find drugs and alcohol I did to manage some horrific stuff going on at their home life or in their parental relationships.  A child can discover that eating is always a good way to distract from their emotions.  This is all not really conscious at the same time, too, when it's going on.  And a teen can discover that they can get missing attention from adults at school by being an impressive A student.  And, of course, there are other examples, but these are examples of self-soothing, that again come from an external thing, like the perfectionism or the looking or the A's or the drugs, instead of having a safe home base at home, regardless of what age the child is.  The child or the teenager is doing their best, and the strategies are often really genius given the situation that they are growing up in.

However, these coping strategies can carry on into our adulthoods, and it looks like this as adults.  We can be workaholic instead of knowing how to manage and soothe our feelings, like really being disconnected.  We can be attached to processes to feel more secure, such as needing that cup of coffee from that place before we go to bed.  We can be attached to processes to feel more secure, such as needing that cup of coffee from that place before we go to bed.  Or working at that time or eating the same thing for lunch every day.  You know, this one does not have to be so black and white.  It depends on you, and it depends on your personal story and how it might relate to your trauma.  We all have things like, I like going to a coffee shop every day and getting sort of similar things, but usually it's not something that I need to have happen every day to feel grounded or secure.  So that's kind of my point there.  What prevents a child from developing self-soothing as opposed to external resources is when they are taught early to manage and talk about feelings and situations that come up with their safe home base.  Again, imagine being like a new kindergartner.  At the end of the first day, imagine having a parent that you are able to reconnect with and discuss how the day went.  And that's like a loving experience of reconnection and celebration.  And that's the thing that resets kids from their fear or their anxiety through a transition.  Most clients, including myself, in most instances did not have that and needed to rely upon like, say, playing video games or going home and watching the Brady Bunch and sit in that loneliness, but still have something that we can kind of latch on to.  Kids need so much connection and help.  And if they do not get it, they come up with ways to deal somehow, which is pretty sad.  The recovery around the negative coping strategy delay depends on kind of what you are coping with.  If it's substances, you will need a specific addiction resource that works for you.  If it's workaholism, same thing.  Like the others, getting out of these delays are kind of twofold.  Finding the resources about the thing you soothe with, as well as the piece of working with the inner child about discussing where it comes from and what can be offered to your inner child to replace what the inner child came up with.  Remember that branch analogy from earlier.  And if you are curious about how to reparent the inner child, you can look at the book, The Reborn of the Inner Child, which is a course available that I will put in the video description of this video.  I reference it.  Inner child work is something very specific that I do on paper between your non-dominant hand and your dominant hand.  So lots of good inner child parenting can be done around this stuff.  And again, access to therapy with someone supportive is ideal.  And I know that there's a whole bunch of barriers to that, which we all know about.  So some final thoughts.  Try to avoid seeing these delays as forever stuck places.  These are fixable over time with some help.  And I think good enough healing brings maturing and catching up in good enough ways.  Also, try not to see this as a shameful immaturity that happens, but instead as places where we often get stuck and when we do not grow up in a developmentally safe household or environment or have safe relationships with caregivers.  Here are some not really connected thoughts here.  A toxic family loves to point out your functioning delays while not understanding that they cause them.  When you think about the parenting and the caregiving, you are not really thinking about neglect.  In other words, we can often be kind of like entertainment for the toxic family about our anxiety about writing a check and all that stuff.  If you know, you know.  So you can also become stunted when the family indirectly says that this is the best it's ever going to get.  So get used to it because of like what they modeled.  Like you may have a very limited parent who did not really try to do better in their life and struggle with functioning stuff, but they are like, this is what life is like when that's not fully true.  Allow for more process.  Such as getting better at something over time, which does not exist in a toxic family.  In the five delays that I discussed here, our family can indirectly say that you are on your own, sink or swim.  You either got it or you do not.  There's no process in any of that.  The ability to get good at something and have some mastery over something.  Getting ready to give up a negative coping strategy or to move on to another level of living is a process that one gradually becomes prepared for, whether that's quitting smoking, or getting into therapy.  It's a process of moving towards something like development.  The childhood development that got stunted due to the abuse is moving towards something that is more significant, that is kind of exciting, like a new level of achieving or a new level of maturity.  Healthy parents are working to help their child function and navigate life, not struggle through it without having a sense of the handbook that other people seem to have gotten.  It's, you know, I think that the handbook is actually being loved and cared for and being sort of taught how to sort of live.  I hope that this video and these ideas are helpful to you.  And I would love to hear from you in the comments about stuff that you relate to or questions you might have.  And as always, may you be filled with loving kindness, may you be well, may you be peaceful and at ease, and may you be joyous.  And I will see you next time.  Visitämntutu.  Com forities.
