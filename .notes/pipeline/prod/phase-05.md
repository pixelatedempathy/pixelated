## Phase 05 â€” Labeling, Augmentation & Quality Control

Summary
-------
This phase focuses on generating labels (automated and human-in-the-loop), augmenting the dataset for coverage, and applying quality controls to ensure high utility for model training and evaluation.

Primary goal
- Produce high-quality labeled datasets with augmentation strategies and verification to support training and evaluation.

Tasks (complete to production scale)
- [ ] Define label taxonomy and label schema for primary tasks (therapeutic response, crisis detection, etc.)
- [ ] Create automated labelers for predictable categories and integrate confidence scores
- [ ] Build a human-in-the-loop labeling interface for edge cases and low-confidence items
- [ ] Implement label versioning and provenance tracking per record
- [ ] Add augmentation techniques (paraphrase, contextual augmentation, noise injection) with guardrails
- [ ] Implement quality control checks (inter-annotator agreement, label drift monitoring)
- [ ] Provide sampling utilities to create balanced train/val/test splits
- [ ] Add tooling to review label distributions and edge-case analyses
- [ ] Add tests for labeler reproducibility and augmentation determinism where required
- [ ] Document labeling workflows and labeling guide for raters in `docs/ops/labeling.md`
- [ ] Add metrics for label quality and expected minimum thresholds
