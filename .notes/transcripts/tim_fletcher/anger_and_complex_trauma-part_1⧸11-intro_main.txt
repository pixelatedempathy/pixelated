in it, abuse and conflict resolution.

So it'll be about eight weeks long if everything goes to kind of how I planned it.

But what I want to do tonight is kind of introduce you to this topic.

And I think most of you know that it's a very important topic.

I deal with people every day.

And what I've learned over the years is that anger for people who are in recovery is one of the biggest relapse triggers.

So many, most addicts at some point in time have got angry at somebody and that's triggered them to want to go use their drink either to punish that person.

I'll show you, I'll hurt you by getting drunk, which means I'll hurt you by hurting me.

And they do that or they go and use just because that's where their brain wants to go to kind of get over the anger.

So it's a massive issue for people.

And so that's why I want to talk about it because I've seen just how big of an issue it is.

But I want to bring into this whole discussion, not just what you would normally hear in an anger management course, but I want you to understand how complex trauma makes this anger issue multiple times more difficult to deal with.

And so I'm going to give you the kind of the cold facts up front.

If you're from complex trauma, you're going to have a lot of trouble dealing with this.

If you're from complex trauma, you've got anger issues and they're going to be even more difficult to deal with.

But I hope we can move to some tools that you find very helpful in beginning to deal with this area of your life.

What I do when I begin teaching, we do a whole week on anger at React.

What I do at the very beginning is just start asking questions and making comments to help people get in touch with their own anger issues.

And I'm going to give you a little bit of of a lesson here.

I'm going to give you a little bit of a lesson here.

I'm going to give you a little about anger issues.

So I get a lot of people that will say they've been angry for as long as they can remember.

They're just not sure why.

But then I'll get just as many people who will say, I don't have any anger.

And I go, wow.

They've probably got tons of anger that they are so disconnected from that they're not even aware that that anger is probably influencing all kinds of the decisions they make on a regular basis.

And so a lot of people from complex trauma have shut down their anger system or they think they have and they don't think it is an issue.

I hope by the end of the night that you'll realize that you're angry and I know you'll probably be angry at me for pointing out that you got anger issues and I've got used to that.

Some who are aware of their anger issues are afraid of their own anger and they are afraid that if their anger gets triggered where it might take them.

And so that for them makes this a very important topic.

And what I have seen is when it comes to guilt in people dealing with trauma and who are in recovery from addiction, their greatest amount of guilt usually comes from stuff they did while they were in the problem.

Using what they did to their kids, etc.

But the second greatest cause of guilt is usually what they've done when they've been angry.

Things they've said, things they've done to their kids, to their partner, to friends, the family that they can't take back.

And the damage has been done and they see the damage and it causes a ton of guilt.

So that tells me further that this anger subject is a problem.

And I think that's a very important topic.

And I think that's a very important topic.

And I think that's a very important topic.

And I think that's a very important topic.

I think that's a very important topic.si is an important one because most people aren't controlling it very well and are doing things that they deeply regret the next day.

But it's too late to take it back.

What makes it difficult in complex trauma is that when you get triggered to get angry What makes it difficult in complex trauma is that when you get triggered to get angry or something triggers your anger, you have a nanosecond in which to make a decision about how to respond, because your anger in a nanosecond or sum of steps is 그때 a nanosecond, because your anger in a nanosecond, second goes from zero to a hundred and you make decisions that take you in old pathways that are very hard to stop once that anger gets triggered so your time to change is less than a nanosecond which makes it super difficult to begin to deal with so it becomes difficult just because of the triggers speed and the intensity of the emotions that come in that nanosecond that leads to the trigger stuff if you're come from complex trauma you probably have hundreds of things that trigger your anger your if you get disrespected and you could get dis disrespected hundreds of different ways each one of those will trigger your anger if there's injustice it will trigger your anger if somebody lies to you or cheats on you that triggers your anger you got trigger after trigger after trigger so you have two good days and you think i got my anger under control and then in one day you get five triggers and you go through to the moon and back with your anger that is how quickly it can get out of control and there's just a lot of things that you have to deal with it's not just the anger it's all the triggers and then some know that their anger at times when it's triggered has gone away and they're not going to make any change cause this is what happened to them до handout there's only one way to look back all of the forces of that enjoyed your anger were deep within you brain it was only in the What is important for you to understand is that the design of anger was that it was to pull you in a good direction.

It was to pull you into problem-solving mode and into positive actions.

Complex trauma changes all of that.

And so now when you're triggered, the force that you feel is super powerful, but it's all to negative things.

And so you're fighting a current, a gravitational pull that is super strong and very hard to resist.

Next, some people coming out of complex trauma find that they become addicted to their anger.

They love it and hate it at the same time.

They love the power that it gives them.

They love the rush.

They love how it intimidates others.

They love a lot of things about it.

So they're not going to be able to fight it.

They're not going to be able to fight it.

So they hate the damage that it does, but part of them still needs it.

And they become addicted to it just like a drug.

And so every morning they get their anger fixed when they wake up, and that gets them through the day.

And then they have an anger hangover that night as their brain gets all foggy and they just feel crappy.

But it is like a drug for them.

Some of you have...

So much addiction to anger and so much anger there that you go looking for a fight every morning.

You just want to vent your anger.

And so if you can't find a helpless driver going down Portage Ave or something else to get angry at, you go push buttons on people and you start to pick fights so you can vent your anger.

And that's how deep the anger has become.

Next one, anger at yourself.

So we tend to think that anger is something that we direct outward at situations that aren't right or that people that are jerks.

But when you come out of complex trauma, a good part of your anger is directed at yourself.

And that can come from guilt.

That can come from shame.

That can come from all kinds of different things.

But there's a ton of anger that has never been...

That has never been resolved towards yourself.

So let me give you the questions that I would ask a group of React clients on their Tuesday morning with Tim.

Scale of 1 to 10 with 1 being absolute, none, zero, next to nothing.

10 being crazy, high, through the roof.

How much anger was in your family of origin?

Now I don't want you to think just in terms of...

You know, explosive anger with dad yelling and throwing things and hitting things.

What I want you to think about is how much anger and tension and awkwardness did you sense?

Because some of you just lived in constant fear and walked on eggshells for fear that somebody was going to get anger.

There was so much tension in the air.

So that would be a 9 or a 10 in your growing up world.

So it could be violent anger.

It could be just supercharged tension environment.

Second question.

As you look at your own life in the past 10 years, on average, where would you put your anger?

Zero anger or living with the needle in the red, constantly ready to blow a fuse and explode at any moment.

So that's an evaluation for you.

And then in the last two months of your life.

Where would you rank your anger?

Would it be the same as your average over the last 10 years?

Or is there a lot less anger in your life these days?

Give yourself kind of a comparison point as you look at your own anger.

And then what has been your latest anger experience?

Some of you it was coming here tonight.

Some of you as soon as you saw somebody here tonight.

Whatever.

Some are agreeing with me on that.

What I want you to think about is.

What is your most recent anger experience?

What is your most recent trauma experience?

And then what I want you to understand is.

What triggered it and how intense did it get?

So that's your latest thing to kind of tap into.

Okay.

So that's a bit of an overview introduction around anger.

Now let me kind of teach you some stuff.

When I look at complex trauma.

The main thing I want people to understand is there's really two types of anger.

That are connected with complex trauma.

So I like to think of a volcano.

And a volcano has all of the lava that is down below the surface.

That is seething, bubbling away all the time.

And then every once in a while there's an eruption.

So anger one is the lava.

Anger two is the eruption.

Okay.

Most anger management courses focus on the eruption type of anger.

And how to control that.

The difference with complex trauma is that the lava anger is the main issue.

And unless you deal with the lava anger.

You're going to keep erupting no matter how many courses you take.

So understanding the lava anger is critical.

Okay.

The next piece is a lot of people say to me.

I don't explode and erupt.

So I must not have any lava.

And I go.

Let's go to the next part of understanding anger.

There's four different ways that we can express anger.

So number one is the eruption.

The violent, angry.

Where you yell things.

You throw things.

You hit things.

You hit people.

You call people down.

Your language changes.

It gets super cruel.

All of that is explosion type anger.

A lot of people think.

That's the only type of anger.

So they think if I don't explode.

Then I don't have anger problems.

But there's three other types.

So the next one is the stuffer.

And that is the person that learned early on.

That if you express anger.

You get punished.

So bottle it up.

Push it down.

Stuff it deep inside of you.

And then never express it.

Now here's what I want you to understand.

What we know now from suppressed anger emotions.

Is it damages you physically.

It damages your physical health.

So people who are angry.

People who stuffed all of that anger.

Usually end up with major health issues.

Like high blood pressure.

Sleep problems.

Constantly irritable.

All of those things.

And it can go to migraine headaches.

And other health issues.

They're now seeing a connection between cardiac or heart problems.

And anger problems.

And even cancer issues.

And anger problems.

So stuffed anger.

You might think you have it under control.

But if you've not resolved it.

You've only stuffed it.

You're setting yourself up as a ticking time bomb.

Physically.

Third type.

Is you punish yourself.

So part of what happens in complex trauma.

Is if somebody's upset.

You are made to think it's your fault.

And then when you were told that it was your fault.

You were then punished.

And what you did is take your parents critical voice.

And their critical response.

And you do it to yourself now.

So if somebody's upset.

You go I must have done something wrong.

Beat myself up.

If you fail.

If you disappoint somebody.

If you don't do it as planned.

If you don't do it as perfectly as you hoped.

Beat self up.

Beat self up.

Now that can be the self harm type of things.

That can be engaging in risky behaviors.

Where you are flirting with damaging yourself a lot.

Or that can be just the voices in your head.

Calling yourself down.

Calling yourself names.

Predicting your future that you'll never amount to anything.

Not allowing yourself to be.

Not allowing yourself to be kind to yourself.

But sticking yourself in the dog house.

And punishing yourself for a while.

That is anger turned inward.

And it is super common in complex trauma people.

Fourth, underhanded.

Now let me say just as you're processing this.

Most people will try all four of these.

Some will end up picking all four.

And then they'll go to the sequence.

So you might start by stuffing stuff for a little bit.

Then you beat yourself up for a bit.

Then you're going to go to the next one underhanded.

And then you'll explode.

Everybody will have their own style.

Some will have only three of the four.

Two of the four.

But you might have a predominant style.

Or a predominant one of the four.

That is your main go to.

So the fourth one is the sneakiest one.

It is where you.

Are angry.

And express your anger.

But you're not even aware that you're doing it.

And they're not even aware that you're doing it.

So let me give you an example.

Sarcasm.

What happens in sarcasm.

You take a shot at a person.

But you wrap it in humor.

You make a joke out of it.

And then they go, did you mean that?

And you go, no, no, I was just joking.

Meanwhile you're going, yes, I got him.

That's what my intent was.

So sarcasm is anger that's sneaky.

It's underhanded.

Another one is giving somebody the silent treatment.

Or one word answers.

How was your day?

Fine.

You feeling okay?

Yep.

Seems like something's bothering you.

Anything bothering you?

Nope.

You want to talk about it?

Nope.

Now they're getting mad.

They're getting mad.

And guess what you're saying?

You got anger issues.

You should go and get some help.

You now got them punished.

And you can make it their problem.

Or if you know somebody is always on time.

And they are religious about punctuality.

And to them when something is supposed to start at 7 o'clock.

To them on time is 10 to 7.

Well you're mad at them.

And they're giving you a ride.

So you show up at 5 after 7.

And they're mad.

And you go, sorry, sorry.

And you make up all kinds of excuses.

But you know that they're really upset.

And you're happy inside.

Because you got them.

So there's all kinds of different things that we can do to punish other people.

That are so sneaky.

We might not even be aware that we're doing it.

And they might not even be aware of what we're doing.

So what I have found with a lot of people.

Is that they are pros at underhanding.

They just don't realize because they've never thought about it.

Or been aware of it.

And as they become aware of it.

Along with stuffing it and anger turned inward.

They go, I've got anger problems.

Because I am angry about a lot of things.

I just never explode.

But it comes out very effectively in other ways.

Okay, now let me bring in the complex trauma.

Which is the cause of the lava.

So where does that lava, that bubbling away deep down inside of you.

And has been for many, many years.

Where did it come from?

So this is the key point that I want you to understand.

Anger was originally designed to be a good thing.

Now that sounds strange to somebody from complex trauma.

Because anger was always bad.

Anger never led to anything good.

It only led to more pain.

And so it's hard to believe or even think.

That anger might be a good thing.

In certain situations.

So here's how anger was designed to work.

In us, we have this built in.

Without even realizing it.

Moral system of what is love.

And so we know that if you love somebody.

And want a healthy relationship.

You have to be honest.

You have to be reliable.

You have to be faithful.

You have to communicate.

You have to respect each other.

You have to be consistent and fair.

That's built in.

It's into our DNA.

So if somebody lies.

What do we do?

We get angry.

And what the anger is saying is.

Alert, alert, alert.

Something is wrong here.

That should not continue.

Because if it continues.

It will damage this relationship.

And it will damage each other.

So anger was designed.

Number one.

To alert you.

That something was either.

Unloving.

Disrespectful.

Unfair.

And not true.

And then the second thing.

It was to give you the motivation.

To make it right again.

And it was to give you the motivation.

To say we got to talk about this.

So that it could be resolved.

So that the relationship would go back to honesty.

And fairness and consistency.

And reliability.

So anger was designed.

It was a beautiful system.

That was designed to protect love.

And loving relationships.

That's important.

And secondly.

Anger was designed.

To be resolved.

So that if something is unloving.

It resolves it.

And then the anger goes away.

There's no more need for it.

Because it is resolved.

Okay.

So that's the original design.

And what helps that whole system.

Is that when you are.

Angry.

Your brain releases a chemical.

Called cortisol.

And that chemical is only released.

With anger and fear.

Slash stress.

Danger.

Cortisol is the chemical.

That gives you the adrenaline rush.

It gives you extra energy.

It makes you hyper focused.

And it is saying.

This has to get fixed.

This has to get resolved.

And it's giving you.

All the help possible.

To have the energy.

And the desire.

To resolve this.

To return it to love.

So what happens in complex trauma?

You live with stuff not being fair.

You live with lies.

And secrets.

You live with unfaithfulness.

And lack of consistency.

And disrespect.

And you're getting angry all the time.

As a kid.

Because you're getting hurt.

Your needs aren't being met.

You're trying to resolve it.

And you get angry.

To want to resolve it.

And what happens when you get angry?

You get punished.

You can't resolve it.

So what is the only option.

Available to a child.

Who is feeling anger.

For all the right reasons.

But they can't resolve.

The problem that's causing the anger.

The problem that is.

The unloving behaviors.

If they can't resolve it.

And they're being hurt.

For showing that anger.

They got to stuff it down.

They got to push it down.

And that starts the formation.

Of lava.

And so lava.

Is suppressed.

Healthy anger.

That you were in a situation.

That in order to survive.

Your only option.

Was the stuff.

And that you learn.

How to do it.

Now let me just say this.

Some children.

Who are maybe bigger.

And taller than other kids.

They stuff their anger at home.

But when they were outside of the home.

They vented their anger.

By bullying other kids.

By mistreatment of property.

Arson.

Mistreatment of animals.

But they're.

All of those things come from.

Angry children.

Who haven't been able to resolve their anger.

In a healthy way.

So they start venting it.

To weaker things.

Than they are.

And so that describes.

Many of you.

Now here's what they're finding.

With trauma.

That goes like this.

When you feel anger.

Severe danger.

Leads to anger.

Leads to adrenaline.

Leads to cortisol.

All of those things.

That give you a supercharged response.

To what's going on inside of you.

You go into full activation.

When you're in severe danger.

Now what they're finding.

With people who have childhood trauma.

Or PTSD from horrific events.

Like war.

Is they stay stuck.

In full activation mode.

So now the slightest little thing.
