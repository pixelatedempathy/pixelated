# TypeScript Error Resolution Tasks - Type 4

## 1. MetaAligner Objective Metrics & Testing (HIGH Priority)

- [ ] Fix objective evaluation result interface mismatches in test files
- [ ] Resolve index signature access errors for objective properties (`correctness`, `safety`, `empathy`)
- [ ] Address ObjectiveDefinition undefined assignment type issues
- [ ] Fix benchmark threshold calculations and criteria breakdown errors
- [ ] Resolve mockEvaluationResult type compatibility problems

## 2. AI Service Interface Standardization (HIGH Priority)

- [ ] Fix AI service method signature mismatches (`createStreamingChatCompletion` vs `createChatCompletion`)
- [ ] Resolve `generateText` method existence issues across AI services
- [ ] Address `AIMessage` import/export naming conflicts
- [ ] Fix AI service mock implementations in test files
- [ ] Standardize AI service response types and interfaces

## 3. MetaAligner Weighting & Prioritization (MEDIUM Priority)

- [ ] Fix objective weighting calculation type errors
- [ ] Resolve weight assignment and multiplication operations
- [ ] Address AlignmentContext property requirements (`userQuery`, `detectedContext`)
- [ ] Fix adaptive selector weight normalization issues
- [ ] Resolve prioritization algorithm type mismatches

## 4. Context Detection & Recognition (MEDIUM Priority)

- [ ] Fix educational context recognizer property access errors
- [ ] Resolve crisis detection result null safety issues
- [ ] Address context detector module import problems
- [ ] Fix user profile property access with index signatures
- [ ] Resolve context identification confidence calculations

## 5. Support Context & Educational Systems (MEDIUM Priority)

- [ ] Fix support context identifier AI service integration
- [ ] Resolve educational context result property access
- [ ] Address learning objective and resource type errors
- [ ] Fix topic area and complexity detection issues
- [ ] Resolve educational type classification problems

## 6. Test Infrastructure & Mocking (LOW Priority)

- [ ] Fix test parameter type inference warnings (`implicitly any`)
- [ ] Resolve mock object property access issues
- [ ] Address test data generation and validation errors
- [ ] Fix test assertion type compatibility problems
- [ ] Resolve vitest mock implementation issues

## 7. UI Component Integration (LOW Priority)

- [ ] Fix missing chart component module declarations
- [ ] Resolve visualization component import errors
- [ ] Address UI component prop type mismatches
- [ ] Fix component export/import naming conflicts

## 8. MetaAligner Core Functionality (LOW Priority)

- [ ] Fix objective definition type validation
- [ ] Resolve criteria evaluation function signatures
- [ ] Address objective metadata handling errors
- [ ] Fix evaluation context construction issues
- [ ] Resolve alignment evaluation result processing

### Next Steps

1. Start with MetaAligner objective metrics test fixes (HIGH priority)
2. Standardize AI service interfaces across all MetaAligner components
3. Address weighting and prioritization algorithm type safety
4. Fix context detection null safety and property access
5. Test all MetaAligner functionality systematically after fixes

### Error Pattern Summary

- **Index signature access**: 52 errors requiring bracket notation for dynamic properties
- **Undefined type assignments**: 28 errors with ObjectiveDefinition and evaluation results
- **AI service interface mismatches**: 19 method signature conflicts
- **Null safety violations**: 16 potential undefined object access errors
- **Test type inference**: 12 implicit any parameter warnings
