# SWOT Analysis

## Definition
Analyze Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats to inform strategy.

## Steps
1. **Strengths** (internal): What do we do well? Unique advantages?
2. **Weaknesses** (internal): What do we do poorly? Limitations?
3. **Opportunities** (external): Market trends we can exploit?
4. **Threats** (external): External risks or competition?
5. Synthesize: Match strengths to opportunities, address critical weaknesses/threats

## Pros
- Holistic view of internal and external factors
- Simple framework, widely understood
- Good for strategic planning

## Cons
- Subjective and qualitative
- Doesn't provide prioritization
- Requires separate execution plan
- Can be superficial without deep analysis

## Example
**Startup SWOT**:

| Strengths | Weaknesses |
|-----------|------------|
| - Fast execution speed<br>- Innovative technology<br>- Passionate team | - Limited funding<br>- No brand recognition<br>- Small team |

| Opportunities | Threats |
|---------------|---------|
| - Growing market demand<br>- Incumbents slow to innovate<br>- New regulation favors nimble players | - Competitor funding rounds<br>- Market saturation<br>- Regulatory uncertainty |

**Strategy**: Leverage fast execution (S) to capture growing market (O) before competitors react; address funding weakness through early revenue or angel investment.

## When to Use
- Strategic planning
