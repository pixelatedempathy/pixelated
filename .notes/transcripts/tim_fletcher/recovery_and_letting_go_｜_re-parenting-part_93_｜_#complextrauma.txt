Well, welcome to another Friday night.

Tonight I want to talk about a term that gets used a lot in recovery and sometimes gets misunderstood and it's the term letting go.

And just to illustrate it, I came across somebody that was asked to just evaluate a treatment program that they had gone through and their comment was just to me very thought-provoking.

They said, well it seems like if I'm going to recover I got to let go of everything.

I got to let go of all the people of my life.

I let go of all the activities that I used to do.

I got to let go of all the places I used to go to.

Just everything I have to let go.

So this term letting go has become really kind of a buzz term, a faddish term.

And what tends to happen when you get buzz terms is they get overworked.

And then as a result of that you get people that attach what they think is the meaningfulness of the treatment program to the patient.

And that's what I'm going to talk about today.

It's shallow.

It doesn't have the whole meaning.

And so misunderstandings develop and that's what I think has happened with letting go.

So just to help kind of appreciate what this person was going through, what they were saying was when they think of this stuff that they're told they got to let go of people, activities, different things in their life, they said I wouldn't have a problem letting go of something if it was all bad.

If it was all bad, if it was all bad, if it was all bad, if it was just very obvious, it did me zero good, it hurt me only.

But the things that I have to let go of, some of the people, yeah, they had some bad parts that led me in bad directions.

But they were also some really good people that helped me, that met some of my needs, that were a source of safety at times, that helped me survive.

There was some good stuff that happened with those people.

There was some good connection.

There wasn't just bad.

things so it's it's a mix of good and bad and to let go of that what does that mean does that mean i just dump everything even though there was a lot of good in it and so you can see some of the confusion that can come out of this term and so what i want to do is really explore this from a bunch of different perspectives to really try to capture the meaning of this letting go term because to me i don't want to get rid of the term it's an important term so let me begin with a perspective that i've come to see over the years working in this field when i first started in this recovery field i quickly began to see a pattern with many people coming into recovery and their lives were falling apart and as happens for most of us when we've got pain and trouble and our lives are falling apart we self-diagnose we try to figure out what's right and what's wrong and what's wrong and what's wrong and what's wrong and what's wrong and so a lot of people that came into recovery thought they had figured out why their life was falling apart they thought they had figured out the main issue that was causing all of their problems the problem was is that they misdiagnosed it but let me give you some examples i have heard so many people say my life is a mess right now because i fell into drug and alcohol addiction or gambling addiction addiction is my problem if i can just stop using drugs alcohol gambling whatever then all my problems will go away all my relationships will be happy my life will be good and so they're seeing that their main problem is addiction and if they just stop using then everything is going to be fixed that is a misdiagnosis yes addiction is part of the problem but it's not the main issue that's causing the problem if i can just stop using drugs alcohol gambling whatever then all my problems will go away all of the problems.

Another example is I've had many people that I've worked with in addiction and they begin to go, okay, here's the reason why I use drugs.

The reason I use drugs is I'm just a partier, a happy going extrovert that just loves parties and celebrating.

And that's how I became addicted.

Or I succumb very easily to peer pressure.

I have trouble saying no to people because I'm such a good person.

And so I just say yes to drinking when people offer me stuff.

And then I get drawn into addiction.

So those are the reasons why I ended up an addict.

Again, what they're thinking is if I can just learn to say no, if I'm just not as party crazy, then all of my addiction issues will go away.

And I go, no, that's missed the point again.

Or I've had people say to me, well, the reason I hit my partner is because I got some anger issues.

If I can just learn to control my anger, I won't hit my partner anymore.

In their minds, what they are thinking as they've diagnosed themselves is I need to let go of one thing because there's only one thing that's causing all of my problems.

I need to let go of that.

And that's, I think, the most important thing.

And that's, I think, the most important thing.

Very simplistic way of looking at things.

It's based on misdiagnosing the picture.

And so it seldom works.

It seldom brings about true recovery, true healing.

What they need to be able to do is expand their perspective to get some help in diagnosing their problem, to see the deeper issues underneath the things that they have diagnosed as the problem.

And to begin to realize that there's many things that are also part of this problem, even thousands of things that all contribute to this problem.

Those are the things that they're going to have to look at letting go, changing the relationship with if they want to make it in recovery.

Let me give you a second perspective.

And it's based on the teachings of Buddha, which has been helpful to so many people in recovery.

So one of the, in very simplistic terms, one of the things that Buddha emphasized was that many of the problems that people struggle with in life is because they've developed an unhealthy attachment to a something, an activity, a person, a thing.

And so if they are going to get healthy and happy, they have to let go of unhealthy attachments.

So let me give you some examples based on what Buddha witnessed in his own culture.

So people developed an attachment to things.

So they thought if I had this thing, then I'd be happy.

Or they had this thing and it really seemed to make them happy for a while.

And so they said, I got to hang on to this thing if I'm going to remain happy.

What came out of that was a desire that symptoms were more likely to occur through a.

And two, one way of doing that is using your elim chef publicly하면 to make you feel happy.

Indeed, it's not my own gift, remember that.

But it is a very easy gift way of doing that.

One outside of their home it's a very��� use.

Again, and it are only accessible to people with notrack income problems or sources of income.

But it's not the use of.

If you got them still, they kind of have to arrive be working for you.

And how you get people to bring your speech out.

It's not based on facts.

It's based on a misunderstanding about happiness.

And so if a person is going to get truly happy, they got to be able to let go of all of these things that they're making the basis of their happiness.

Other people, Buddha realized, formed unhealthy attachments with people.

It resulted in them being overly dependent on a person to meet all of their needs.

That then prevented them from growing up.

That resulted in stunted growth.

That resulted in an inability to think for themselves, to make decisions for themselves.

That resulted in being willing to put up with stuff in a relationship that was very unhealthy, that kept them unhealthy, and refusing to grow up and change because they didn't want to lose the relationship.

And so an unhealthy attachment to another person could do a lot of damage to a person.

And so the whole point that Buddha was focusing on was if you are going to get healthy, if you are going to be truly happy, you have to let go of unhealthy attachments.

Now he didn't use the language that we would use today.

But what he was wanting people to realize is, letting go is a huge part of getting healthy.

But the focus is letting go of unhealthy attachments.

Now, I just want to comment on this because a lot of people, I think, have taken what Buddha taught and really focused, I think, in a way that's out of balance.

And it's basically let go of everything.

You don't need anybody.

You don't need anything.

Just let go, let go.

Then you'll be happy.

What the researchers showed, what Buddha was showing us, and this to me is so critical for people in recovery, is yes, part one is I need to let go of unhealthy attachments, but there's a part two.

And part two is I need to create healthy attachments.

I need to attach to the right things and have a healthy relationship with those things and those people.

And so I'm letting go of unhealthy attachments, so that I can replace them with healthy, with even better things.

That is the key to recovery.

So it's not just focusing on the negative.

Oh, you got to let go.

You got to let go.

It's no, you got to let go of unhealthy attachments.

It's about attachments.

Am I attached to unhealthy things in unhealthy ways?

If that's the case, let it go.

It's all about developing healthy attachments.

You can't let go of unhealthy attachments.

You can't recover without healthy attachments.

That is so critical.

Now, as always, I want to bring in the complex trauma piece, because this to me sheds the greatest light on this letting go.

It helps people really understand what this letting go is all about.

So in my mind, what comes out of complex trauma is a whole bunch of things that I develop, attachments to, I connect to that aren't healthy.

And so recovery is realizing all of the hundreds and thousands of things that I have developed unhealthy attachments to, and realizing if I'm going to get healthy, I got to let go of this person, the unhealthy parts.

I got to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts.

I got to let go of this thing, the unhealthy parts.

And I have to let go of this activity, the unhealthy parts.

And I have to find healthy.

So let me explain that.

So several aspects that come out of complex trauma.

So number one, we connect to things that aren't healthy.

So we have said over and over again that the greatest drive that a child is born with is to connect, to attach.

Because a child can't meet any of their own needs.

So the only way they're going to survive, and get their needs met, is if they attach to somebody who can meet their needs.

The bottom line with complex trauma is a child tries to connect with mom and dad or caregivers, but they're either too busy, too involved in their own issues, don't care, don't know how to meet the child's needs, don't know how to connect, don't know how to be present.

And so the child is not able to connect with those, those people.

That then puts the child in a dilemma.

Because they need to connect.

They're driven to connect.

So if they can't connect with their caregivers, they will connect with something.

So here's kind of how it plays out in general terms.

The first thing that the child will try to do is they still want to connect with mom and dad.

And they'll use two methods to try and connect with mom and dad.

If mom and dad won't connect with me when I'm authentic, they must find something wrong with me.

Something that's my fault that causes them not to want to connect with me.

So that's a shame message.

So therefore, I will learn to fawn.

I will learn to be what they want me to be.

I will learn to read them, their needs, their priorities, their beliefs, and I will become what they want so that then they will connect with me.

So I will become a people pleaser.

So the whole belief then is if I'm going to get my needs met, I need people to connect with.

But the only way to do it is not by being authentic.

It's by being fake.

Authenticity prevents connection.

So that's number one.

Number two is, okay, if they still don't want to connect, they don't want to connect with me, even when I'm a super good people pleasing person, then I will find an area that causes them to give my attention, even if it's doing bad stuff.

So I will be a really bad kid.

And if that causes them to be fully present to me and give me their full attention, they will connect with me.

That is better than nothing.

If I have to be sick all the time, have problems all the time, be in pain all the time, and that's the only thing that gets their attention and empathy, then I will do that.

If I have to be angry and rebel and be violent and that gets their attention, that's good enough.

But I am desperate to get their attention.

I will resort to whatever I have to do to try and get their attention.

So those are the two things they still try with parents, but then they go beyond that.

Okay, it's obvious I'm not fitting in and connecting very well at home.

So let's look outside the home for sources of connection, where I can fit in, where I can belong.

So let's find peer groups where I can fit in.

And so they look for what they think are the cool kids, the kids that they wanna be like, the kids that they see as they seem to get respect, they seem to be looked up to.

So what do I have to do to fit into this group, to belong, to get my needs met, to connect with this group?

That becomes their next connection point.

But again, what I want you to see is their belief is, if I'm gonna fit into this group, I can't be authentic.

I have to conform.

I have to fawn.

I have to be a chameleon, be what they want me to be.

That is the only way I will connect and get my needs met.

So they have a form of attachment, but it's not a secure attachment.

It's very conditional on them continuing to conform.

But then it goes beyond that.

They're still not totally satisfied.

They still are driven to want to connect in other ways.

And so they will now try to connect with things that give them the feelings of connection, that they feel.

So let's look in a different perspective.

We've got a little bit of a mix up here.

they should be getting from a person but there's not it's not happening with people so let's try to get the feelings from things so they might have a teddy bear a blanket they might get a new bike and that bike just makes them feel so good it gives all the positive feelings that they should have got from people but now they get from a thing then it goes beyond that they then develop activities that are soothing that give them really good feelings that help them disconnect from the pain of their day-by-day existence that help them not have to be present in the pain of their day by day but escape that pain for a while and have good feelings so they might escape to a fantasy world they might just play video games all day and that takes them out of their world they might eat food and food gives them the good feelings and and takes them out of the world they might find masturbation and that takes them out and gives them all the good feelings they might get into porn they might get into sports or even extreme sports and adrenaline rush stuff but they begin to find activities that give them all the good feelings give the feelings that are really good and they develop connections they attach to those activities as being lifelines as being necessary things for them to get their needs met to be happy and then part of what develops with that is they're witnessing the world around them is they begin to develop beliefs that if i have this type of success if i have this much money this much position if i have this body if i have these possessions if i have this friend group they develop an image of what they think will make them truly happy and then they develop an attachment to that image to the status that they think they need so what i want you to realize is what comes out of their life are certain things complex trauma is the child is still driven to connect and if they can't connect in a healthy way with mom and dad they will find other things to connect with and those things will not give true secure attachment they will give some of the feelings but they will leave their soul empty but they will still connect with it because it does give positive stuff but it will lead to great heartache down the road so what that means in recovery is that if you're going to get healthy then you have to let go of the unhealthy connections with unhealthy people with unhealthy activities with unhealthy things now the problem is that if you're going to get healthy is that with a lot of those things there was some aspects of them that were healthy playing a video game eating food having sex there's a healthy part to that but you've attached to it in a way that you've overdone it and you've overused that to try to meet needs it wasn't designed to meet and now you have an unhealthy aspect to that connection so you've got some healthy connection stuff happening but lots of unhealthy connection stuff and so for you to get healthy it's for you to begin to realize i have to separate what part of this is healthy what part of this is unhealthy i can maintain a relationship with this thing in a healthy way but i need boundaries now so that i don't slide into the unhealthy relationships what i might find in some cases is this person or this activity or this thing is totally unhealthy it is totally toxic for me i need an extreme boundary where i cut it out of my life but for most things i am going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have the old boundaries that allowed allowed healthy and unhealthy i now i'm going to have new boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that will only allow the healthy and cut out the healthy and that is the thing that i'm going to find a change in boundaries i'm not going to have a change in boundaries that takes a ton of work and time to figure out but that is recovery now let me show you a second part of complex trauma so not only are all these connections happening that are unhealthy they're adaptations coping behaviors that are happening that are allowing the child to survive to protect them from being hurt to try and get their needs met and what you find is some of the adaptations the parents approve of other adaptations that parents don't approve of and so the adaptations that get validation from parents you develop a special attachment to those are the hardest to let go so let me give you some examples of some of the adaptations and again many of them have a mix of healthy and unhealthy so a child who might be naturally funny and that gets validation from their parents might just conclude they need to be funny all the time or a child might conclude that to stay safe they have to always be in control and so they work to become control of everything and everybody or and they're going to survive and get their needs met they need to be a people pleaser they need to learn to read the rules and they need to be able to be a good person and they need to be able to be a good person but sometimes or nice findings of their own and then get to work and get a bit of their needs met so third we have incitement from the bottom and 96% are inclined towardsFF you know it are a not you and you are੒ ent 궁금MM is when false sources

traditional sounds benefit visit buddy can you move me true Ericbase get rid of all this<|jw|> And lying becomes their adaptation.

Others go to, I'm not going to trust anybody.

Everybody stabbed me in the back, betrayed me, let me down.

Don't trust anyone.

That's their adaptation.

Others live with constant anxiety because there's always been danger around them.

So their adaptation in the brain is just to be constantly on guard, hypervigilant, always having a bit of anxiety.

Others develop a strong inner critic where you're constantly judging yourself.

And then others develop a critic that turns outward where you're looking at everything, finding fault with everything, being negative and critical of everything.

That's your way of surviving.

That's your adaptations.

Others go to, I will be a flirt.

I will be very sexual.

I will have a perfect body that's very sexual.

I will try to be.

I will be the most desired person in the room.

I will perform fantastic in bed.

Everything becomes about sex.

That's their adaptation.

Others go to, I will be a workaholic.

I will constantly help others.

I will be smarter than everybody.

I will have all kinds of accomplishments that get me respect.

That's their adaptation.

They get tons of validation for that.

That's their adaptation.

And that makes them think, this is a great adaptation.

This is working very well for me.

Others go to, I will never be angry.

I will never be sad.

I will never get depressed.

I will be happy all the time.

I will avoid conflict at all costs.

I will never rock the boat.

That's their adaptations.

Others go, I will suppress every negative emotion.

I will do everything I can to make sure that I'm doing the right thing.

I will deny my feelings.

I will minimize my pain.

In other words, I am going to use my brain to make everything go away so that I don't feel.

So I will become a head, a brain on legs minus feelings.

Others take their brain and the adaptation of the brain too.

I will overthink everything.

If I could figure everything out.

Analyze everything to death.

Then if I can figure everything out, then I can solve everything.

And I'll fix all my problems just by thinking.

And so that's their adaptation.

Others go, I will become invisible.

I will have no needs.

I will never make demands.

I will never put myself out there.

That way I'll never get hurt.

I will never be a burden to anybody.

Nobody will resent me.

Others.

I will be super compliant to a religious organization, to a group and do whatever they want.

And I will live this very moral religious life that will give me tons of validation within that group.

And then I'll get my needs met.

So what I want you to see is all of those adaptations got the child validation, kept the child safe.

Got their needs met.

And so a child will develop a super strong attachment to that because it seems to work.

It's not until 20 to 30 years later that they begin to realize that all of these adaptations that kept me safe physically are now maladaptations.

They are not working now.

I'm not able to have an intimate relationship because I don't trust.

I'm not able to have a relationship with a child because I'm a control freak because I suppress all my feelings.

It is causing me all kinds of problems.

So what I thought was a great adaptation now is hurting those I love now is hurting me now is preventing healthy relationships in my life.

So when you stop and think about that.

Most people from complex trauma.

I've got hundreds of adaptations.

That are really maladaptations.

They kept them safe physically.

But now they're preventing a healthy life, healthy relationships, and they're hurting those you love and yourself.

So to get healthy means to let go of all the unhealthy adaptations.

That is a lot of letting go.

That is a lot of figuring out.

Okay.

I adapted by people pleasing.

But that doesn't mean that I should never.

Please anybody.

I now have to figure out when it's healthy to please people when it's unhealthy to please people.

I can be in control or I can be funny, but I can take it too far.

I can go from healthy funny to unhealthy all the time funny.

I can go from healthy control to unhealthy control.

I have to figure out healthy use a healthy adaptation versus an unhealthy maladaptation.

And so that is so hard to do, especially when you've spent the last 20, 30 years thinking it was a great adaptation when it seemed to be working for you.

But now you've got to figure it out and let go.

Well, there's a third thing that comes out of complex trauma, and that is beliefs and values that are basically lies.

So a child because of living in an unsafe environment has a world.

That they live in that they develop a whole set of beliefs that seem to be the truth, but they actually prevent a healthy life in a safe environment.

So again, let me give you some examples.

What comes out of complex trauma is a child begins to believe that if you see the real me, you're going to reject me.

You're going to abandon me.

Therefore, never be authentic or authenticity does not result in connection.

It causes people to reject me.

So you're going to be fake.

You're going to be fake.

You're going to be fake.

But being fake results in connection.

So be fake or you can't trust anybody.

So everybody's going to stab you in the back and let you down.

So don't trust anybody.

So they believe that that's the truth.

That's how they need to approach adult life and relationships.

Or I'm constantly being criticized, neglected, abused, abandoned.

I'm a failure.

I can't do anything right.

I don't deserve a good life.

Others believe my needs don't matter as much as yours.

My needs always have to be subservient to yours, subject to yours, because I don't matter as much as you.

Or I must be perfect in order to be good enough.

Or I must never be angry or upset.

Or you must never be angry or upset with me because that proves that I'm not good enough.

That proves that I'm not good enough.

That proves that I'm not good enough.

That proves that I'm bad.

Or my greatest asset is my body.

Or my greatest asset is my brain.

Or my greatest asset is my accomplishments.

I don't have inherent value.

So I must always be accomplishing something in order to have value.

People are only going to be interested in a relationship with me because they want to use me.

They don't love me with no strings attached.

There's always strings attached.

There's always space attached.

I have a hidden agenda.

The only way I'm going to get respected is to be successful in the world's eyes, to have all the right externals.

I'll never be respected for who I am only for my position, my possessions, my power.

If I ever am sad or angry, I'm a bad person.

I must never have needs- me.

They will see me as a burden or they'll see me as a selfish person.

Introverts are inferior to extroverts.

Extroverts have lots of friends.

Extroverts are the life of parties.

So if I'm an introvert, then I'm an inferior person.

If I'm not funny and a bit crazy out there, then people will think I am boring and not want to be my friend.

So for a child coming out of complex trauma, they have hundreds of these lies that they believe, but they seem like the truth to that child.

Those following those lies, don't trust anybody, put your needs below everybody else's, they don't matter.

That seemed to be the truth that kept them safe.

That got some of their needs met.

And so when you come 20, 30 years later and you begin to realize what I thought was the truth is actually a lie, that is a shock.

But then to let go of that lie that seemed to be the truth that served you what seemed to be quite well for years, but now those lies are preventing healthy relationships.

Now those lies are causing you to sabotage everything that you've been doing.

Every good thing in your life.

Now those lies are causing you to hurt the ones you love the most.

What you begin to realize is a child formed a strong attachment to those lies.

And now in recovery to let go of those lies, to face those lies and let go of them, it is easier said than done.

It is a slow, painful process to begin to identify, the lies, number one, then to let go of them.

But it is so important to do that.

And so what I want you to realize is when we look at recovery, to me, to really make sense out of this letting go term, it only makes sense when you really understand the complexities of complex trauma.

It leads to all of these connections that are unhealthy.

It leads to adaptations, that are unhealthy.

It leads to lies and beliefs that are unhealthy.

And so recovery is figuring that out and learning.

I got to let go of a whole bunch of unhealthy stuff.

So let's look at how do we do that?

What's involved in letting go?

So I have to say upfront is be patient with yourself.

Go slow in this process of letting go.

I don't know.

I don't know if it's a good idea.

I don't know.

If it's a good idea, I would say.

But if you're a patient and you're like, Oh, I'm going to be able to do that, I'm not going to be able to do that.

But even if you're in that process of letting go, I'm not going to know if it's the right thing to do.

I don't know anybody that just sits down one day and figures out exactly what they need to let go and let's go of it in one day.

It just doesn't work that way.

Letting go is a process.

It's a process first of figuring out what I need to let go, what part's healthy, what part's unhealthy, and then coming to a point where I'm able to let go.

Because sometimes we know something is unhealthy.

We know something we need to let go of.

We just know we're not in a place where we can let go.

And it's going to take time before we get to the place where finally we're just able to let go.

We can't force ourself in some cases to let go of something that we have such a strong bond with.

So let me give you a few things about why this is a slow process, why we have to be patient with it.

The first thing is that our limbic brain and the cortex, they let go on different schedules.

So your cortex can actually figure out academically, see stuff academically, weigh out the pros and cons, see the negative consequences, and say, yep, that should be let go.

And it can do that very quickly.

It's the limbic brain that causes the problem.

Because the limbic brain, the emotional part of the brain, is what developed an emotional attachment to something unhealthy.

Because it seemed to work.

It has a lot of emotional memories of the good things that came out of that.

And so it's the limbic brain that takes a long time to get to a point where it's able to let go.

So a lot of recovery, people just try to get your cortex to say, yep, this is bad for me.

And just to make a decision.

And your cortex can't let go.

And so it's a lot of recovery.

And so it's a lot of recovery.

And your cortex, as if that should just magically make it happen.

Understand you're working also with your limbic brain.

And it takes a long time for your limbic brain to come to a point where it can let go.

But there's a second thing.

And it's understanding the default setting of our subconscious brain.

You see, you can let go of something and think, okay, I've let go of that.

But then without even realizing it, you slide it down.

And that's the second thing.

And that's the back into picking it up again you slide back into that because that's the normal for your brain that's where your brains live for decades that's your default setting your autopilot and if you're not consciously constantly working at maintaining letting go your brain will slide back into depending on that again attaching to it again and so what many people find is they let go slide back into it have to let go all over again slide back into it have to let go all over again that's part of the process as well but then there's another piece to this what we hope for is that when we make a change that it's going to lead to something very positive in my life and it does but what we don't factor in is that it also brings in some negative consequences so positive change leads to positive consequences but it also leads to negative consequences let me explain so let's say that you're decide you're going to stop people-pleasing well now your parents don't like it when you say no now some of your friends don't like it when you say no they don't like this new you that sets boundaries that say says no to them that doesn't just suppress your needs and put their needs ahead of yours and so now you're getting opposition you might even get persecution you'll get gas lit by them and told by them that you're being selfish you will get pressure put on you to try to get you to conform to the old dynamics of the relationship so all of a sudden this new change is not getting everybody cheering for you it is getting some people quite upset with you that means you might have to end the relationship or even start another relationship and these are real statistics to help your success but by ignoring this all the myself might say no now it's all been adjusted and which is below numbers the number of��자 it's 사고 김박 dispon을!' gradually comes in from the top higher level the most simple thing is you it's really important to think about trying to believe that things will be okay for the life that you're in it's hard to believe if people are being selfish orığ慢慢다고 그만 to Wert Maurice blame you for being selfish, that blame you for being a narcissist.

You start all this second guessing stuff.

Then whenever you start changing, you're moving into an area of life you've never lived in before.

This is all brand new.

This is unknown territory.

I don't know how to live here.

I have no role models here.

I don't have great tools here.

Now I'm living in unknown.

Now I'm living in change and that's triggering a lot of fear.

So what happens for a lot of people when they get to this point is, I don't know if the positive results of this change are worth it.

There's been so many negative consequences that come out of these changes.

Maybe it's better to go back to the way things used to be.

Maybe it's better to just go back to conform to what everybody wants.

Then I'll be happy.

Then everybody else will be happy.

Surely that's the way to go.

And so they reach a fork in the road.

And so to change, it means short-term pain, opposition, people upset with you.

It leads to all kinds of dealing with stuff and fear that aren't pleasant to deal with.

But there is a pro and it's long-term.

Eventually it's going to lead to a better life.

It's going to lead to greater joy.

But the other fork of the road is, if I go back to the way things used to be, I'll get short-term pleasure.

Everybody will be happy with me again.

Everything will look good again.

But the con is I will get long-term pain even greater.

So the point is, it doesn't matter what path I'm going to choose, I'm going to get pain.

In the healthy path, I'm going to get short-term pain, but long-term pain.

So I'm going to get short-term pain, but long-term pain.

Healthiness, joy.

In the other path where I say, let's go back to unhealthy, I will get short-term pleasure, but even greater long-term pain.

So I will get pain either way.

My limbic wants to go back to short-term pleasure.

It doesn't want to factor in long-term pain.

I need to get to my cortex and say, hey, I want long-term pleasure, joy.

And so it's better to evoke kapila, which means to say, hey, I'm looking forward to spending less time on eating things.

I'm trying to get when I hear shrimp, well, I might need this again and that was pretty nice.

I said, okay, but I don't call it وال.

Life in that way can't always One of the about two steps you getvate is being deeply collected.

Don't leave photos or just low-grade about it as you have an oily siadal.

But just e and will that will make your up to speed.

But looking from the Nonetheless, what I am result will be very shortly term as long as you frying went to Deus poisonous trend.

If you're considering something different in your lifetime, why that's what we love, let us start with your Asian friends.

We were hearing a question which comes up again and to suppress your desires and put everybody ahead of you that that's what love means now when you stand up for yourself and say no my needs matter just as much as yours i need to be loved just as much as i love in order for it to be a healthy relationship that feels selfish that feels wrong when i set boundaries with family it feels like i'm disloyal to family that feels wrong so to get healthy actually is going to feel wrong for a while it's going to feel unsafe for a while and it takes three to six months to transition through that to a new healthy normal that's your default where that wrong feeling begins to disappear but be prepared for that because that makes many people think i'm being wrong i need to go back to where my limbic brain doesn't feel guilty and then there's another piece that happens so when you deal with your people pleasing the issue that you're wanting to change and you begin to explore it you begin to realize the reason i people please is because i have shame underneath i need people to like me to feel good about myself so for me to deal with my people pleasing i have to deal with my shame oh my goodness another issue a deeper issue i didn't even see i just thought i had to stop people pleasing i have to deal with my shame oh my goodness another issue people pleasing but now i realize i can't stop people pleasing unless i heal my shame so it's like i reach a new level of where i need to let go of but it only makes me aware of an even deeper level that i gotta let go of a new level means a new devil that is frustrating and that is hard and then the final one is every time i go to change and i step into this new unknown and i let go of my shame and i let go of my shame and i let go of my shame and i let go of my shame and i let go of my fear and i let go of my past hope and i let go of my life and all my 70 delusions i let go of my Würzburg, Verlangel and the bear and i make sure when i think to myself please let go of my babies and my child and that was when i started raising my mind and thinking that why don't i say this what i'm going to close my mind so this is the first chapter and that's thelichkeit so the philosophy my знаете that's why people love me all the time and next chapter i go to argument only to prove that is coisa que zij tem forma at once.

Tackle one thing at a time.

And so it can be a person or a thing.

So let's say you realize I've got a person in my life.

Yes, there's a really unhealthy attachment.

Maybe there's some good in that relationship.

There's a lot of unhealthy.

Or maybe this person is totally toxic.

I got to totally cut them out of my life.

Don't try to sort that out with every person.

Do it with one person at a time.

Now, the fear for many people is that every relationship that has an unhealthy element, it's all or nothing.

I got to get rid of them all, totally kick them to the curb.

No, it doesn't work like that.

There's going to be some people that are so toxic, you have to cut them out of your life.

But that's rare.

For the most part, the people in your life, you might have, so let's take your parents.

You still want a relationship with them.

There's still a lot of good in that relationship.

There's still a lot of good in that relationship.

There's still a lot of good in that relationship.

There's still a lot of good in that relationship.

There's still a lot of good things in that relationship but there are some unhealthy things you depend on them too much you put your needs below theirs you don't set boundaries with them you let them take advantage of you you let them disrespect you and you realize if i'm going to get healthy i have to change that i have to set boundaries i have to say no i have to not be so dependent on them i have to put my needs as just as important as theirs okay that's going to be a lot of work to figure that out maybe i have to start by just saying mom and dad if i come over here and you treat me with disrespect i'm going to leave or in your own mind say i'm going to spend less time with mom and dad not let them talk to me every day for hours i'm going to kind of limit my time with them start with boundaries that are attainable and begin to work on improving that one-to-one relationship with your kid so that way you can have a balance of the two of you a healthy relationship with your kids and a healthy relationship with your kid so that way you can have a balance of the two of you area and moving it to a healthy place then let's go to activities you go okay i need to change my relationship with food i need to change my relationship with tv i need to change my relationship with social media doesn't mean i cut them totally out of my life though i might need to do it for a little while i need to sort out when am i engaging and attaching to tv in a healthy way when is it unhealthy when am i using sleep and on a in a healthy way when am i using it in an unhealthy way when do i serve others in a healthy way and when do i serve others in an unhealthy way and begin to sort out what part do i let go of what part do i keep one way that helps a lot of people in recovery in sorting this out is internal family systems and basically what it realizes is that when the child was little, all of these adaptations create kind of what they call parts.

Different things, each adaptation is like another person, a part that develops to protect this wounded child from getting hurt again.

So they lie, they get angry, they control, they manipulate, they people please.

All of those are firefighters and managers, parts that are all trying to protect this hurting child.

And so the whole point of IFS is this, there are no bad parts.

All of them, their ultimate desire was the safety of the child.

They just used the tools they had to tell lies, to get angry, to lash out, to become invisible, to be funny all the time.

Those are all parts that are designed to protect the child.

So don't be trying to beat them up.

Don't get down on yourself that they were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

They were different.

their job of protecting the child.

What you do now is go to those parts and say, thank you for the job you did.

Thank you for serving this vulnerable child so well.

But I want you to know that I've now developed tools to protect that child myself.

So I'm glad to still have you around, but I don't need you to feel responsible now to take care of that child.

I'm going to give you kind of your retirement.

I'm going to give you some time to think about what you're doing.

I'm going to give you some time to think about what you're doing.

I'm going to give you some time to think about what you're doing.

And so if you're able to see that all of these adaptations were just kind of parts all designed to protect the child, so you're not getting down on yourself and being judgmental and critical, but you're just beginning to understand and explore that, wow, this brain of mine was so sophisticated in trying to protect me.

Now I'm just changing.

I'm just changing.

That I have better tools to protect myself now.

Let me give you two final things.

Letting go of all of these things, people, things, activities, always results in an element of grieving.

I'm losing something that used to be important in my life.

So I will probably have a time of grieving.

Allow yourself that.

But finally, recovery is not just about letting go of unhealthy.

Recovery to be true recovery has to be all about forming healthy attachments, replacing the unhealthy attachments with healthy people, healthy activities.

Make that your focus.

Just don't focus on breaking and letting go of unhealthy attachments.

Really focus on forming healthy attachments.

That's when your recovery starts to deliver true healing and true joy.

Well, that's the end of another Friday night.

I hope that helps you.

I hope that just gives you more understanding and perspective.
