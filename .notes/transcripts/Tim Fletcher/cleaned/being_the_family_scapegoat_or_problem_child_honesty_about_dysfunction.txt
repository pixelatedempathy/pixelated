When you come out of complex trauma, you develop ways of relating to survive.  And those kept you safe, the ways you learned to relate.

But what you find is as you get older, they do not work so well anymore.

But it's important to go back and really understand your relationship style and why you relate the way you relate.  When we talk about complex trauma, one of the terms that I use regularly is a dysfunctional family.  And I have had many, many hundreds of people say to me, everybody's got a dysfunctional family, we are dysfunctional.  And what goes on in their mind is this distinction that goes, the only other option to dysfunction is perfect.  So nobody's got a perfect family, so we are all dysfunctional.  And that seems to make sense, but it really misses an important piece.  And that is dysfunctional, the opposite is not perfect, the opposite is functional.

But what does that mean?  So the word dis for dysfunctional actually means in pain.  And so what we mean when we say a dysfunctional family, it's a family that's in pain.  And a family that cannot resolve pain.  So let me broaden that for you.  All families go through pain.  All families have hard times.  All families have bad things that happen.  A functional family is able to deal with those things, resolve it, and come out the better for it.  So there are functional families.  So to be a functional family does not mean you never go through pain.  You never go through hard times.  All families do.  What makes it a dysfunctional family is it cannot resolve that pain.  And so the members of the family live in unresolved pain, which leads to the piling up of pain.  And that is the reality of a dysfunctional family.  And so what we are going to see as we go into this, is that dysfunctional families are not the same.  They are not the same people.  They are not the same people.  So to put it in other words, the child's pain is the same as the one that's going through pain.  And a dysfunctional family is the one that's going through pain, not the one that's going through pain.

But the problem is that children growing up in pain, they begin to go in their mind, what do I need to do?  And they have three different priorities in their mind.  Needs met in this family that is in a lot of pain and so that's where the roles come into play in a family of complex trauma a dysfunctional family there's the one child that's referred to as the troublemaker they are the ones that's defiant rebellious angry all the time and he just will not get with the program and smarten up now let me say this right up front of all the roles that we are going to look at the problem child is the one person in the family that is being honest everybody else is lying both to each other and to the other and so that's the one child that's referred to as the troublemaker and to themselves what is going on in the scapegoat or the problem child is they are saying this this family is sick and I am not going to lie about that we are messed up and everybody walks around like we love each other and like all our needs are being met well they are not and I am not going to go along with it I am rebelling now what what I want you to get is this they are willing to do everything they can to get rid of the problem child and their rebellion is actually a healthy thing because they are saying I do not want a house of lies where we abuse and hurt each other I refuse to go along with that I rebel against what's happening here now that's how it starts a good rebellion the problem is it goes into a bad rebellion and it's a bad rebellion and it's a bad rebellion and it's a bad one too but if now we have walking around with the broken heart that we know clearly that the rules are the rules you pay no price on it and now this tries to do the misane towerssamaides like you know what give a man a face of power not a role like that right now when you save your future it's the America Black Lives Matter is one of the biggest ones that llegó an étoile called the scapegoat he is blamed for all the problems in the family in the marriage and what the parents basically communicate is this if we did not have this child we would not have any problems in our family it all gets pinned on that child so they are actually quite happy to have this child because they got somebody to blame for their stuff and they do not want to look at their stuff so they have a scapegoat to put it on so that then results in this problem child getting blamed for everything and so more stuff gets piled on them all the time now a couple of the things are happening with the scapegoat the scapegoat is a problem child and it's a problem child and it's a problem child and it's a problem child and it's a problem child becomes the honest expression of how everybody's really feeling but afraid to show so when he rebels and he gets angry and he lashes out and he speaks his mind to mom and dad he's really giving a voice to everybody they will not admit it but that they are almost thankful for but then what happens with this scapegoat is they are really ostracized by the family the family says you are the problem and they kind of feel like a black sheep they do not fit they do not belong in this family because they refuse to play by the rules of this family and so they feel like an outsider and outcast so that's as a child now let me show you what happens when the Naru time or text really in that adult life but now I said goodbye인데 mother as they gave you explain you I install yet with in checking one as they can extend the order into adult life a他的 help lady they had to rebel.  And in order to rebel, they had to harden their heart and harden their skin and shut down their sensitivity.  And so what begins to happen in a problem child as they get into their teens is they try not to feel anything at all.  And they shut everything down.  Now that will become problems for them later in life.  They will have to relearn how to feel emotions.  They will have to really enter into scary territory.  So that's the first problem.  The next one, part of their rebellion in their teens is they started getting applause from other kids for being a bad boy.  And so they said, wow, here's how I get.  I get my validation.  I cannot be validated in my family because the hero gets all the validation.  So I will get validation from being a bad boy.  And they tried to be the baddest of the bad.  And what often happened is they felt in order to get new validation, they had to keep pushing the envelope.  So last time they drank a whole 12-pack at a party.  This time, they are drinking a 2-4 at a party.  And everybody's going to talk about how drunk they got.  And then they push and push always a new way of rebelling against the system.  And that can be a problem.  And then as soon as somebody says, who's in authority, I want you to do this, they have trained themselves to do the opposite.  And then they have trained themselves to do the opposite.  And so in a relationship, if their partner said, could you do this for me?  They just get their back up.  And they do not want to do that for them.  And so to have a relationship, they are going to have to look at that rebellious knee-jerk reaction that is so part of how they train themselves to respond to authority and to rules.  And then they are going to have to look at that rebellious knee-jerk reaction that is so part of how they train themselves to respond to authority and to rules.  And then much of what they learn to do in their rebellion is to manipulate people, to intimidate people.  So they got what they want, but people do not see them as safe.  People see them as a bit of a danger, a loose cannon, as a person who could not be trusted, a person that's just got too many anger issues.  And so they, they struggle with all of that.  And so the problem child, it started out really good.  They refused to accept a sick situation.

But what happened is they, in order to maintain that role, had to get sicker and sicker themselves.  They do not realize how sick they had to become.  And so now, when they come into adult life, they are going to still find people who pat them on the back for being a bad boy and pushing the envelope.

But if they are going to get healthy and have healthy relationships, they got to be able to let that bad boy go.  Now here's a challenge that many have.  They go, well, if I let go of the bad boy, then, who am I?  I do not want to become a weak, little, mushy, sensitive person again, that's going to get walked all over and hurt.  And so to give up a role, either the hero or the problem child, the scapegoat, there's a fear, a fear that if I drop this role, will I get hurt again?  Will I get my needs met again?  What will happen?  And so for the scapegoat, the hero, yes, there's fear, but you are never going to get healthy unless you walk through it.  And that's what we are about, is helping people walk through that and begin to change so that they can have meaningful relationships today.

Let me say one final thing about the problem child, the bad boy.  I find that, so let's say you were a bad girl, okay?  Is not it interesting how bad girls are attracted to bad boys?  And guess what happens in recovery?  Bad girls, they are prepared to give up being a bad girl, but for some reason, they are still attracted to bad boys.  That's a recipe for disaster.  So if that is your pattern, you are going to have to look at that piece as well.
