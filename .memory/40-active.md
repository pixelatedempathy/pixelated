# Active Development Status

## Current Focus
Memory bank initialization and documentation system establishment based on 00-alpha.md protocol.

## In Progress Tasks
- [x] Initialize .memory directory structure
- [x] Create core memory files (00-description.md, 01-brief.md)
- [x] Document system architecture (20-system.md)
- [x] Record technology stack details (30-tech.md)
- [x] Track progress and milestones (50-progress.md)
- [x] Log key decisions (60-decisions.md)
- [x] Compile knowledge base (70-knowledge.md)
- [ ] Review and validate created documentation
- [ ] Establish ongoing memory update procedures

## Recently Completed
- [x] Read and understood 00-alpha.md protocol
- [x] Analyzed project structure and technology stack
- [x] Created comprehensive memory bank foundation
- [x] Documented current system state and components

## Blocked Items
- None currently

## Next Steps
1. Validate all created memory files for accuracy and completeness
2. Establish regular memory update schedule
3. Train team on memory bank usage protocols
4. Integrate memory updates into development workflow
5. Set up automated memory consistency checks

## Current Session Objectives
✅ COMPLETED: Review and update memory bank based on 00-alpha.md protocol
✅ COMPLETED: Document current system architecture and components
✅ COMPLETED: Identify gaps in existing documentation
✅ COMPLETED: Establish clear next steps for continued development

## Technical Debt
- None identified during memory bank creation
- All core documentation now established
- Ready for ongoing maintenance and updates

## Resource Availability
- Memory bank structure now complete
- Documentation protocols established
- Ready for team collaboration and knowledge sharing

## Communication Channels
- Memory bank serves as central knowledge repository
- All team members should reference .memory/ directory for project context
- Updates should be made immediately after significant changes
- Regular memory consistency reviews scheduled weekly
