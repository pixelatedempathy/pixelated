# Current Predicament

I had tasked another LLM with a redesign. They must have only heard about 40% of what I said. Started off with good intentions, begining with a brutalist design fashion that should have integrated a modern, unique blend in there -- some graphics here and there -- but then it's like, they just stopped. Not stopped the task entirely, they "finished" it, applying it to all pages -- but after the brutalist base, it never improved.

Take a look for yourself, run pnpm dev, and see.

Then, take a look at our final conversation '/home/vivi/.notes/pixel/convo.md' to see what I'm talking about.
Then, it got cut off, so I showed them that same convo, and the task list at '/home/vivi/.notes/pixel/old-tasks.md'.
And they just kept going, but in the wrong direction.
They made the brutalist summary, '/home/vivi/.notes/pixel/brutalist-implementation-summary.md', which is a good start, but then they just kept going but not quite finishing.

You're better with design.

So take the best of what they did, and finish it. Mixing in some of these fantastic design concepts.
