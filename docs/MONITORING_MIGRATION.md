# Monitoring Cost Comparison & Migration Strategy

## Current GitHub Actions Cost (EXPENSIVE! ðŸ’¸)

**Current Setup:**

- Runs every 15 minutes = 96 runs/day
- Each run: ~5-8 minutes (full setup + Playwright tests)
- Monthly usage: ~2,880 runs Ã— 6 minutes = 17,280 minutes
- **Cost: ~$35-60/month** (GitHub Actions pricing)

## Better Alternatives (MUCH CHEAPER! ðŸ’°)

### 1. Docker Health Checks (Already Implemented) - **FREE**

- Built into your containers
- Runs every 30 seconds
- No external dependencies
- **Cost: $0**

### 2. Prometheus + Alertmanager - **FREE**

- Real-time metrics and alerting
- Already have Prometheus configured
- Custom alert rules for your specific needs
- **Cost: $0** (runs on your existing infrastructure)

### 3. Uptime Kuma - **FREE**

- Beautiful web interface
- Multiple notification channels
- Runs in Docker container
- **Cost: $0**

### 4. External VPS Monitor - **$5/month**

- Simple script on external VPS
- Independent of your main infrastructure
- Can monitor from multiple locations
- **Cost: $5/month** (cheapest VPS)

### 5. External Services

- **UptimeRobot**: Free plan (50 monitors, 5-min intervals)
- **Pingdom**: $15/month for basic plan
- **StatusCake**: Free plan (unlimited tests, 5-min intervals)
- **Better Uptime**: $18/month

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Immediate (This Week)

1. âœ… Set up Prometheus alerting rules (created above)
2. âœ… Add Alertmanager for notifications (created above)
3. âœ… Create external monitoring script (created above)
4. ðŸ”§ Configure Slack/Discord webhooks for alerts

### Phase 2: Replace GitHub Actions (Next Week)

1. Deploy monitoring stack with docker-compose
2. Test all alert conditions
3. **Change GitHub Actions from every 15 minutes to once daily**
4. Eventually disable the frequent GitHub Actions entirely

### Phase 3: Optimize (Following Week)

1. Set up Uptime Kuma for visual monitoring
2. Create monitoring dashboard in Grafana
3. Fine-tune alert thresholds

## Expected Savings

- **Before**: $35-60/month
- **After**: $0-5/month
- **Savings**: $30-55/month ($360-660/year!)

## Better Features You'll Get

1. **Real-time alerts** (instead of max 15-min delay)
2. **Multiple notification channels** (Slack, Discord, email)
3. **Better reliability** (doesn't depend on GitHub Actions availability)
4. **More metrics** (response time, memory usage, etc.)
5. **Historical data** in Grafana
6. **No GitHub Actions quota consumption**

## Quick Start Commands

```bash
# Start the monitoring stack
docker-compose -f docker-compose.monitoring.yml up -d

# Run external monitor (for external VPS)
./scripts/external-monitor.sh

# Start the Node.js health monitor
cd scripts && node health-monitor.mjs
```

## Next Steps

1. Configure your Slack webhook URL in the alert configs
2. Deploy the monitoring stack
3. Test alerts by temporarily stopping a service
4. Reduce GitHub Actions frequency to daily
5. Monitor and optimize thresholds
