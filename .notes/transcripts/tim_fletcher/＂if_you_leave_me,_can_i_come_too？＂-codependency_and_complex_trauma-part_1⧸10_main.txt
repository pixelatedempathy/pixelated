So tonight I want to start a new series.

I mentioned it to you two weeks ago on codependency.

So here's my thing for it.

If you leave me, can I come with you?

Which is codependency in a nutshell.

If I leave you, can I come?

If you leave me, can I come with you?

I've been teaching codependency for 15 years now.

And if you know me, I'm always learning.

And every time I teach it in workshops, I get new insights and questions get asked that take me in a little different direction.

And so this series is going to be kind of a blend of some of the older stuff that I've taught, but a lot of the newer stuff that I've put together over the last couple years.

And it's probably going to be an 8 to 10 week series just because there's so much material that I want to cover.

And so let me just say a couple introductory.

Codependency is a term that has become overworked.

And so a lot of people hear it and they just tune it out because they think they know what it means.

And it's kind of gained its own baggage.

And a lot of people really don't understand it.

And that's part of why I want to do this series.

But secondly, if you were to come to React on any given week, there would not be a week that would pass where codependency wouldn't come up.

It is one of the most talked about things in recovery.

It is one of the questions I get most frequently by clients in recovery.

And so what I have seen is an extremely important topic.

Not just because I get asked about it a lot, but what I have found over the years is a lot of people come into Finding Freedom and React and they think that drugs and alcohol is their main addiction.

But what I have learned is that it's not.

What I have learned is that probably an addiction to a person is probably a greater addiction.

And that is a codependency thing.

And what I have found is if they don't deal with that, that will keep them not only messed up in their personal life and in their relationships, but that will keep taking them to relapse to drugs and alcohol.

And I would say that probably the greatest cause of relapse that I have seen is codependent relationships.

It does so much damage.

And it is one of the hardest things to deal with because it plays off of natural human needs, relationships, love, belonging.

And so when people come into recovery and they're lonely and they're hurting and they're broken, they long for a relationship and usually end up in a romantic one that is codependent.

And it just makes life worse for them.

And leads to a relapse.

And so it is, in my mind, one of the most important topics for people to face in their recovery if they have a chance of making it in recovery, but also if they want to have a healthy life.

And to have healthy relationships.

And to have their kids grow up seeing mom or dad getting healthy, not just keeping the old crisis cycle happening.

Over and over again.

Which does a lot of damage to them.

The next thing that is important for me in explaining this is, there's lots of teaching about codependency that's out there, but I don't think you can really understand codependency until you understand complex trauma.

Do you realize that everybody basically that is codependent has complex trauma?

And so it is one of the main symptoms.

That come out of complex trauma.

And so you need to understand the complex trauma piece if you ever hope to deal with the codependency piece in your life.

And so that's why I want to look at this topic, but I want to look at it from the perspective of complex trauma so that you'll more clearly see the issues that need to change and be dealt with if you ever hope to really deal with that.

And so I want to look at this topic, and I want to look at it from the perspective of complex trauma.

I want to look at it from the perspective of how we can deal with the codependency piece.

What you're probably going to find is that this is going to get really heavy for you at times.

And there's going to be times where you're going to say, I am so screwed up, I just want to end it now.

There's no hope for me.

Because you're going to see some of your relationships put into words, and you're going to think, I'm going to post your picture on the screen up here as an example of codependency.

That's how personal this will get for you.

But then it's going to get painful because you're going to see the damage it's done to your kids as well.

But I don't want to just take you to a painful realization.

I want this to turn into tools so you can heal and develop healthy relationships.

So let me start by just helping you get an intro to the topic tonight.

And I just want to show how codependency comes out of complex trauma.

So complex trauma, in my mind, the greatest piece of damage that it does is in a person's sense of their identity.

So it does in a child who is neglected and abused and abandoned.

They think the reason that dad is neglecting me or abusing me is because there's something wrong with me.

And they draw conclusions about their identity that I must not be good enough, I must not be lovable, otherwise dad wouldn't abuse me or neglect me or abandon me.

And so complex trauma produces this core identity called shame.

And that is what does the greatest amount of damage in my mind when it comes to understanding complex trauma.

Now take a child with shame thinking it's all my fault and then put them in a situation where they're trying to survive and stay safe.

And what comes out of that is it makes a healthy relationship impossible.

So complex trauma takes the possibility of healthy relationships and it makes it impossible to have a healthy relationship with a healthy person.

And that's what we're talking about.

Because of shame and because of being in survival mode.

And so anybody coming out of complex trauma knows how to have a kind of relationship but it's not a healthy one.

And that is where the damage happens.

And so what comes out of that is they go into relationships but they don't know how to make them healthy and they don't know how to make them happy.

And so the very thing they're trying to do is keep safe they are now actually producing the opposite.

They're setting up relationships where they keep getting hurt.

And that is to me part of the huge negative effect of complex trauma as it spreads beyond the person into relationships.

Okay, let me begin with a basic definition.

And this isn't mine.

Kind of from a textbook point.

And then I'm going to over the next weeks just start coming at it from all kinds of different angles.

And if you know me, you know we're going to come at it from at least 20 different angles in order to get a better and better understanding of this thing called codependency.

So a basic definition says a codependent relationship involves one person supporting or trying to solve the other person's problems.

So it's all about people trying to solve each other's problems, meet their needs mainly their self-esteem needs and their emotional needs.

Okay?

That's part one.

Part two, what that means then is that one person or both person but mainly one person becomes ends up becoming an enabler of the other person's unhealthy behavior.

So you're trying to support them but what you're supporting is them being immature and irresponsible and you're cleaning up their mess after them trying to solve their problems and fix them but you're giving them permission to never grow up.

And so you end up with relationships that are much like a parent and a child.

And they drive you crazy.

And so you are supporting unhealthy people.

Healthy behaviors, not healthy behaviors.

And then what happens with that is the enabler becomes totally occupied with solving the other person's problems and trying to meet their needs that they totally lose track of their own needs.

And they are living without their own needs being met and they don't even know how to meet their own needs.

So they're dying inside trying to give life to somebody else who doesn't want life.

And that is the disaster that comes out of co-dependency gradually.

So what you're going to see is co-dependency is like addiction.

It gradually gets worse and worse and worse and those in it get sicker and sicker and sicker.

So the longer you stay in a co-dependent relationship the worse you get, the worse they get and the sicker you both get and everybody around you.

And so that is the basic definition.

So I say there's a couple things about addiction that therefore are involved with co-dependency.

Number one, co-dependency can be you're addicted to a person.

So they're your crack pipe.

They're the person that you are saying make me feel alive.

Solve all my pain problems.

Solve all my emptiness.

Give me life.

I am, you're my crack pipe.

And you become addicted to them.

So like the addiction, even when it gets to the point that you know your crack pipe is no longer giving you positive experiences but is only making your life a living hell you can't let go.

And the same is true in co-dependency.

This person is becoming more and more toxic and destroying you.

But can you get rid of them?

Uh-uh.

You're addicted to them.

And so that is the first part.

Second part, it's also you're addicted to an unhealthy way of relating even a destructive way of relating.

So it's an addiction to a relationship style that isn't healthy.

And that's what we're going to be developing over time.

But here's what I want you to see.

If you look at the necessary ingredients for a healthy relationship, honesty, trust, respect, you don't find those in co-dependency.

So the very thing necessary, the very ingredients necessary for a healthy relationship, what happens in a co-dependent relationship, you're trying to have a healthy relationship without those ingredients.

And it's impossible.

But people will keep trying.

The third thing that I think is a great summary statement is co-dependency, is how a shame-based person approaches relationships.

And that's what I want to develop now in helping you get the core explanation and understanding of what co-dependency is.

So let me take you back to a simple definition of complex trauma that you may never have thought of before.

Complex trauma always happens in a situation, usually home, where the person with the most power is a narcissist.

And they make it all about them.

So they want everything to go the way they want it to go.

They want everybody to respond to their needs, to their emotions, to their wants, and they want everybody's life to revolve around them.

That's what creates complex trauma because now that person who's the narcissist abuses the people that don't do the stuff that they want.

It neglects people because it's all preoccupied with its own needs.

And it abandons people to pursue its own selfish pursuits.

So complex trauma always takes place with a narcissist in power.

What we're going to see next week, and I'm actually going to give you a test, is co-dependent relationships usually always have a narcissist.

And that is the thing that makes up a co-dependent relationship.

So then what happens when a child has a dad who's a narcissist?

Dad is all about his own needs and when the kid has a need, what does dad say to the kid?

Quit being so selfish.

And he makes the child feel bad for having a need.

He makes the child feel guilty for having a need.

So now the child feels shame because dad's abusing them and not giving them attention.

And they conclude it must be my fault.

I must not be lovable.

I must not be good enough.

And then dad says you're selfish for having needs.

So that's a double whammy so far that comes out of that narcissist.

One way to look at a definition of what is shame, it is the dis-ease of self.

And what that means is you're not comfortable in your own skin.

You don't like yourself.

You're uneasy with who you are.

And as a result of that, you don't have any positive feelings about yourself.

So many of you can go back in your mind to childhood and remember many days sitting on the swing or in your room feeling no positive feelings to yourself.

Hating yourself.

Feeling unlovable, not valuable, the shame piece.

Okay?

So the child then is going, their brain is going, I don't want to stay in these painful feelings.

What do I need to do to fix it?

So here's what you have to understand next.

The brain doesn't go, I need to fix my inside because it's concluded my inside is bad.

So where is the solution going to come from?

I don't have any positive feelings about myself.

So the only way I can feel good about myself is if others have positive feelings towards me.

And then I'll piggyback on their positive feelings towards me.

There is where codependency begins.

You are looking outside yourself to make yourself feel better as a way to deal with your shame without dealing with it internally.

This solution will never work.

But that is the belief behind all of codependency.

So let me develop that further.

So then what the child says is this.

How do I prove that I'm lovable?

How do I convince myself that I'm lovable?

Well, I just have to be in a relationship with somebody.

And that proves that they want to be in relationship with me which proves I must be valuable and lovable.

So therefore, to prove I'm lovable, I got to be in a relationship all the time.

Because if I'm not in a relationship, that proves nobody wants me.

And that therefore proves that I'm not lovable.

So now I have to be in a relationship.

And some of you understand that.

I've had many clients who when they know a relationship is about to die, they don't end it until they got somebody else waiting.

And then they end this one and move right into the next.

Because they can't be alone.

Because being alone proves to them their greatest fear that they are unlovable.

So then the next thing is now you're in a relationship.

So how do I get them to see value in me?

I have to solve their problems.

I have to help them.

So now you go into a relationship as either a helper who's going to be a hero and rescue somebody.

And then when you rescue them, they're going to go, Oh, I adore you.

I love you.

You're so wonderful.

And you're getting all kinds of positive validation.

And you go, this is the perfect solution to my shame problem.

Or you go to, I'm so needy.

I got so many problems.

I'm never going to take responsibility for myself.

Please rescue me.

And you get all these knights in shining armor come swooping in and give you all this attention and rescue you.

And you go, this is fantastic.

I'm going to be a needy-aholic for the rest of my life.

Because I get attention.

Why should I ever move off the pity pot?

Because I get all this attention.

This is a solution.

So now what you see is you've got a helper and a needy person as the basis of a relationship.

So that's where codependency begins.

Okay, now we go further.

So now you got this person in a relationship.

You go, I got to be happy all the time.

Because if I'm sad, they might get tired of me and leave me.

If I ever get angry at them, they might go screw you and be gone.

Or if I let them in to see the real me, they go, who are you screwed up?

I'm gone.

So I got to put this perfect mask of being happy all the time.

That's the only way they will keep loving me.

So you realize what you just did?

You went from being a needy.

You went from being a human to being a one emotion person who's a fake.

Because that's what you think you need to get positive attention.

You think if you're real, you will never get positive validation.

But then you go further in your thinking, and that is not only do I have to be happy, I got to keep them happy.

Because if they ever get disappointed or angry at me, they might leave me.

Or if they're ever sad, they might just get depressed with their relationship and leave me.

So the only way they're going to keep giving me positive validation is if I'm happy, but I got to keep them happy.

So what does that mean?

I can't be happy unless they're happy.

My happiness now depends on them being happy.

So therefore, my priority now is I'm going to take responsible for their emotional world, and if they got a problem, I'll fix it for them just so they'll stay happy.

If they're angry, I'll calm them down and fix everything up just so they're happy.

So now they don't have to grow up at all.

They can stay an angry, immature kid, but I will fix all their problems just so they're happy, so they keep giving me positive attention.

That's the only way I can solve this.

And so now you got somebody sitting around saying, do this for me, I'm mad at you, and the other person's running around fixing everything so they stay happy.

The room got really quiet, so I think maybe we're hitting home.

The next thing that then happens is if I'm going to keep them happy, I better develop a radar system that is alert to their every mood.

So that the minute they're walking, no, don't even wait till they walk in the door, I can get them to come in.

I can tell by the way they drive down the driveway what kind of mood they're in.

And I can tell by the way they shut the door what kind of mood they're in.

So I'm going to have this radar that is more aware of their world than of my world.

I'm going to have a radar that knows their every emotion and that can even maybe read their mind once in a while, but I don't have a clue what I feel or think.

I'm plugged into them.

So now my identity is a reflection of theirs.

So I'm no longer a person, I'm just a reflection of them.

You following what's happening here?

As this progresses.

Now what will happen if you have a child who says, dad's a selfish jerk.

I'm not going to go running whenever he gets angry.

And you're the enabler who's got to keep dad happy.

What are you going to do now?

You're going to beat your kid up and say, quit being so selfish.

And you're going to say, you've got to keep dad happy and you're training your child to be codependent.

And you're punishing them for trying to be real.

And so what happens in those families is that the enabler isn't just trying to keep dad happy, it's making all the kids cooperate with the program.

And that is what does a bunch of damage as well.

Okay, now you've got to go to the next thing.

So in order to keep them happy all the time, that means I have to be willing to sacrifice all my needs and all my desires.

Because they don't matter anymore.

All that matters is their desires if they're going to keep happy.

So I will sacrifice my needs and I'll put them on the shelf.

And what happens then is if I feel a need and express a need, I feel guilty for expressing a need.

And I train myself to feel guilty for having needs.

So I sacrifice that, but then this son in the center of the universe, the narcissist, he demands more of your attention.

And he says, I can't be convinced that you love me unless you have no friends and no family.

So I'm going to start cutting out your friends and your family.

Okay?

And your activities.

So I'm the only person in your world.

And you want to know what you do?

You go ahead with it.

And you sacrifice all of that as well.

And then he's going to say, you should put up with my anger.

I'm just having a bad day.

You should put up with me hitting you.

You probably deserved it.

And now you keep moving the line in the sand to tolerate more and more, to sacrifice your values and your morals more and more.

Now you start lying for them.

You start covering for them.

You're breaking your own moral conduct to keep them happy.

So you are getting sicker and sicker to accommodate their growing narcissism.

And then what you can see comes out all of this is the narcissist is the superior and you are definitely inferior.

They look down on you.

They see you as a servant.

They don't even treat you with respect, but they demand respect from you.

So there is a dynamic relationship change where there's no longer equals here.

This is a relationship of a superior narcissist and an inferior person.

Beyond that, a healthy relationship over time, both parties make sacrifices about 50% of the time.

Both parties, one person gets their kind of what they want to do one day, the other person another day, and it balances out to about 50%.

So if you were to go to Bermuda with Kim and I, there were some days Kim did what I wanted, there's other days I did what she wanted.

Because that's just what you do.

But not in a codependent relationship.

Now one person gets their way 100% of the time and the other person gets their way 0% of the time.

And that is not healthy.

But there's always within the codependent hope that they will change.

And you stay in it and stay in it.

Okay, that's a lot of heavy stuff.

And I just want to keep going very quickly.

So a child wasn't taught in complex trauma how to meet their own needs in a healthy way.

That's number one.

So I'm just adding now to how complex trauma is.

I'm just adding now to how complex trauma affects children and sets them up for codependency.

So they weren't taught how to meet their own needs.

Okay?

Their parents didn't meet their needs.

So their own needs are something they're very out of touch with.

And they don't have a clue how to be aware of them or how to meet them.

All they know is how to set them aside and meet somebody else's needs.

Next thing, complex trauma is all about a child feeling unsafe and alone.

Nobody having their back.

Nobody protecting them.

So what happens is in order to stay safe physically, you have to squash all the things that are necessary for a healthy relationship.

To stay safe physically, you don't talk, you don't feel, you don't trust.

You don't do the things necessary for a healthy relationship.

So complex trauma, the need for safety squashes healthy out of a child.

Now in adult life, you come into relationships and you don't know how to do healthy.

You still operate by don't trust, don't talk, be dishonest, lie.
