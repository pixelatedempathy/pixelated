Boundaries are the rules that I live by.  So what I eat, how much I eat, when I go to bed, when I get up, my daily routine, all of those different rules that I live by, hopefully they are designed so that I will be healthy.  And then there's a second type of boundary, and that affects my relationships with people.  And it covers two things, how close I will let them into my world, how connected I will let them become to me, and how I will let them treat me and how I will treat them.  So boundaries, what most people in recovery realize is that in their upbringing they were not taught healthy boundaries, both personal internal boundaries and boundaries in relationship to people.  And so if they do not learn healthy boundaries, they do not get healthy, and if they are an addict, they do not stay clean and sober.  So boundaries.  Most addicts find learning boundaries that are healthy and forcing them is one of the most important things they can do if they are going to have any chance of getting clean and sober and becoming a healthy person.
