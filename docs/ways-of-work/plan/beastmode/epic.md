# Epic Name
Pixelated Empathy Therapist Training Simulator (Beastmode)

# Goal
**Problem:**
Therapists lack scalable, realistic, and bias-aware training tools for practicing clinical skills, handling edge cases, and receiving actionable feedback. Existing solutions are limited in scenario diversity, clinical fidelity, and bias detection, making it difficult to prepare for real-world challenges, especially in crisis or culturally sensitive situations.

**Solution:**
Build an AI-powered therapist training simulator that enables role-played client interactions, session tracking, bias detection, and therapist evaluation. The system will use modular architecture for rapid prototyping, support mock agents initially, and allow seamless upgrades to advanced LLMs. It will provide real-time feedback, progress tracking, and robust security/compliance features.

**Impact:**
- Improved therapist preparedness and skill development
- Enhanced bias awareness and mitigation
- Increased user engagement and satisfaction
- Measurable improvements in training outcomes and clinical decision-making

# User Personas
- Licensed therapists and counselors
- Trainee therapists and students
- Clinical supervisors and educators
- Product managers and AI researchers

# High-Level User Journeys
- Therapist logs in and starts a training session
- Interacts with a simulated client (AI or mock agent)
- Receives real-time feedback and evaluation
- Reviews session history and bias reports
- Tracks progress and areas for improvement

# Business Requirements
**Functional Requirements:**
- Role-played client scenarios (depression, anxiety, crisis, cultural edge cases)
- Therapist evaluation and feedback
- Real-time recommendations and session analysis
- Bias detection and reporting
- Interactive dashboard for progress tracking
- Session context and conversation history tracking
- Modular frontend and backend components
- API endpoints for client responses and evaluation
- Memory integration for session state
- Secure authentication and data storage

**Non-Functional Requirements:**
- Performance: Real-time feedback and low-latency interactions
- Security: HIPAA compliance, encrypted data, audit logging
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 compliance for UI
- Data Privacy: User data protection and consent management
- Extensibility: Modular for future LLM upgrades
- Maintainability: Clean, testable, and documented code

# Success Metrics
- Number of completed training sessions
- Therapist skill improvement (pre/post evaluation)
- Reduction in bias incidents detected
- User engagement (session frequency, duration)
- System uptime and performance
- Compliance audit pass rate

# Out of Scope
- Full LLM integration at MVP (will use mock agent initially)
- Non-therapist user features (e.g., patient-facing tools)
- External integrations (EHR, third-party analytics) in MVP
- Advanced analytics and reporting (beyond basic dashboard)
- Non-English language support in MVP
