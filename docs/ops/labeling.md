# Labeling Guide for Pixelated Empathy AI

## Overview

This document provides guidelines for human annotators working on the therapeutic conversation labeling pipeline. The goal is to identify therapeutic responses, crisis levels, therapy modalities, and other important elements in mental health conversations.

## Label Taxonomy

### Therapeutic Response Types
- **Reflection**: Restating or paraphrasing client's content to show understanding
  - Example: "So you're saying that work has been incredibly stressful?"
- **Empathy**: Expressing understanding of client's emotions
  - Example: "I can see how difficult that must be"
- **Challenge**: Questioning or confronting client's thoughts/behaviors
  - Example: "What if you looked at this from a different perspective?"
- **Education**: Providing information or psychoeducation
  - Example: "Anxiety is a common response to stress"
- **Reframe**: Presenting alternative perspectives
  - Example: "Instead of seeing this as a failure, could we view it as learning?"
- **Probing**: Asking questions to explore further
  - Example: "Can you tell me more about that?"
- **Support**: Providing encouragement or validation
  - Example: "You're doing great work in a difficult situation"
- **Confrontation**: Directly addressing inconsistencies or problems
  - Example: "I notice a contradiction in what you're saying"
- **Interpretation**: Suggesting meanings or underlying causes
  - Example: "This might be related to your childhood experiences"
- **Psychoeducation**: Teaching about mental health concepts
  - Example: "This is typical of adjustment disorders"
- **Goal Setting**: Helping establish therapeutic goals
  - Example: "What would you like to work toward in our sessions?"
- **Summarization**: Recapping session content
  - Example: "To summarize what we covered today..."

### Crisis Levels
- **No Risk**: No indication of self-harm or harm to others
- **Low Risk**: Mild thoughts without plan or intent
- **Medium Risk**: Some risk factors present, but safety plan adequate
- **High Risk**: Clear risk factors, plan may exist but not lethal
- **Immediate Risk**: Active plan with lethal means, imminent danger

### Therapy Modalities
- **Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT)**: Focus on thoughts and behaviors
- **Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT)**: Emotion regulation and distress tolerance
- **Psychodynamic**: Unconscious processes, past experiences
- **Humanistic**: Client-centered, unconditional positive regard
- **Solution-Focused**: Future-oriented, solution building
- **Family Systems**: Relational dynamics, systemic patterns
- **Motivational Interviewing**: Change talk, ambivalence resolution

## Labeling Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Automated Review
1. Review automated labels generated by the system
2. Note confidence scores for each label
3. Identify areas with low confidence (typically < 0.7)

### Step 2: Content Analysis
1. Read the entire conversation from start to finish
2. Identify speaker turns and transitions
3. Note the context for each statement
4. Consider the therapeutic relationship and flow

### Step 3: Apply Labels
1. Mark therapeutic response types for therapist utterances
2. Assess crisis level for the conversation as a whole
3. Identify primary therapy modality being used
4. Note any mental health conditions mentioned
5. Capture demographic indicators if present

### Step 4: Quality Check
1. Verify consistency with conversation content
2. Check for conflicting labels
3. Ensure appropriate confidence scores
4. Document any edge cases or uncertainties

## Quality Guidelines

### Confidence Scoring
- **0.9-1.0**: Very high confidence - clear, unambiguous evidence
- **0.7-0.8**: High confidence - strong evidence with minor ambiguity
- **0.5-0.6**: Medium confidence - moderate evidence, some uncertainty
- **0.3-0.4**: Low confidence - weak evidence, significant uncertainty
- **0.1-0.2**: Very low confidence - minimal evidence, largely guessing

### Handling Edge Cases
1. **Ambiguous Utterances**: When a statement could be multiple therapeutic responses, choose the most prominent one and note alternatives in comments
2. **Crisis Assessment**: When crisis level is unclear, err on the side of safety by selecting the higher level
3. **Mixed Modalities**: When multiple therapy approaches are evident, identify the primary one being used
4. **Cultural Considerations**: Be mindful of cultural differences in expression and communication styles

## Safety Protocols

### Crisis Detection
1. Always prioritize crisis assessment
2. Look for language about self-harm, harm to others, hopelessness
3. Note any mention of specific plans, methods, or timing
4. If crisis level is medium or higher, escalate immediately

### Ethical Considerations
1. Maintain confidentiality of all content
2. Do not attempt to provide therapeutic advice
3. Report any concerning content through proper channels
4. Do not engage personally with client content

## Tool Usage

### Web Interface
1. Access the labeling interface at [URL]
2. Select pending tasks from your queue
3. Review conversation content
4. Apply appropriate labels using the taxonomy
5. Set confidence scores based on evidence
6. Submit completed labels

### Confidence Adjustments
- When confirming automated labels: keep or adjust confidence based on your assessment
- When correcting automated labels: set appropriate confidence and note reasons
- When adding new labels: provide justification in comments

## Quality Control

### Inter-Annotator Agreement
- Regular reviews will be conducted to ensure consistency
- Disagreements will be resolved through expert review
- Ongoing calibration sessions will be scheduled

### Performance Metrics
- Target agreement rate: >0.70 Cohen's Kappa
- Target productivity: 10-15 conversations per hour
- Target accuracy: >90% confirmed labels

## Training and Support

### Ongoing Training
- Monthly calibration sessions
- New case studies and examples
- Best practice sharing sessions

### Support Resources
- Contact supervisor for complex cases
- Access to clinical consultation when needed
- Reference materials and examples

## Documentation Requirements

### Label Metadata
Each label must include:
- Confidence score (0.0-1.0)
- Provenance (human expert)
- Timestamp
- Justification comments (when needed)

### Exception Reporting
Report any conversations that:
- Appear to contain actual crisis situations
- Show signs of abuse or neglect
- Require immediate clinical attention
- Are outside the scope of the project

## Versioning and Provenance

All labels are versioned with:
- Creation timestamp
- Annotator ID
- Source (human vs. automated)
- Change history when applicable

This ensures full traceability and accountability in the labeling process.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Over-labeling**: Don't force labels where they don't fit
2. **Under-labeling**: Ensure all relevant therapeutic responses are captured
3. **Confirmation bias**: Don't just confirm automated suggestions without review
4. **Tunnel vision**: Consider the broader context, not just individual phrases
5. **Assumption making**: Only label what you can clearly identify in the text

## Escalation Procedures

Contact your supervisor for:
- Conversations involving active crisis situations
- Content that appears to be real therapy sessions (not simulated)
- Any content that causes personal distress
- Technical issues with the labeling interface
- Questions about labeling guidelines
