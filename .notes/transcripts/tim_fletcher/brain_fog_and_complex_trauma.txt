Once in a while in their life, something is going on, and all of a sudden, it's like their brain stops working.

They go into this brain fog.

And it's a very frustrating thing.

It's a very confusing thing for people.

There can be degrees of brain fog.

And you can experience them on the same day.

So you can go from kind of a mild brain fog where you're just a little bit sluggish in your thinking, have trouble finding words, to more severe brain fog where you lose the ability to speak.

It's just all very much on a spectrum.

So let me give you some examples of just various ways that this can show up.

So I know a young man who, great business mind, great business potential.

And so coming out of university, got jobs, did extremely well in the business world, very sharp mentally, great thinker, great analytical thinker.

And so he decided he wanted to go out on his own and be an entrepreneur, start his own business.

He had all the skill set, the brain for it.

And he got out on his own.

And all of a sudden, he found he couldn't think.

He had trouble making decisions.

It's a very difficult thing.

It was just a terrible, terrible thing for him.

It's like his brain shut down.

And what he began to realize was he did super well as long as the stress wasn't too great.

As long as somebody else was the boss making the final decisions, carrying the weight and responsibility of the whole organization.

As soon as he put himself in that role, the stress became too great and his brain didn't work as well.

So that's one example.

Another one is a person I know well and they were going through a very stressful time in their life.

And one evening, all of a sudden, their brain got very fuzzy.

And then they lost the ability to speak.

They just clammed up.

They couldn't find words.

They couldn't speak.

And then the next day, they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching.

And they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching for a long time.

And they realized that they'd been watching a movie that they'd been watching for a long time.

And that evening before.

And they couldn't remember anything about that movie.

And so they realized that it affected their memory as well.

So that is another example.

A third one from somebody I know.

And they wrote this.

I have noticed that if I am dealing with a time crunch and I have a lot to do or I have to do something that I don't like doing.

My default and it's almost imperceptible.

It's a mental tape that says.

Yeah.

Yeah.

I love that.

I'm failing or I'm going to fail, I begin to have a super hard time focusing.

It's all of a sudden something happens in the brain where they can't concentrate properly.

So they tend to jump then from task to task in the middle of what they should be doing.

So, oh, let's do this.

Let's do this.

Let's do this.

I especially have a hard time focusing on tasks that require intense thought and focus.

Rather, I find myself looking for quick and easy tasks to do or I catch myself switching to some mindless task.

So those are examples just to give you a sense of what we're talking about.

Many of you can quickly identify that, yes, you've experienced this.

A lot of people, when they go through this, they just think they're the only one that it's happening to and they get really down on themselves and think something's wrong with them.

So, know that you're not alone.

This happens to a lot of people.

And what we're going to look at now is that this comes out of primarily complex trauma.

This is a common complex trauma thing.

Now, before we get into that, I need to say that brain fog can be caused by other things.

So brain fog can be caused by hormonal changes.

So some women in pregnancy go through brain fog.

It can also be caused by a change in diet.

So some people who change their diet up go through some brain fog because of changes in sugars and stuff in their body.

If you abuse alcohol, that can cause brain fog.

If you have a new medication, that medication might cause brain fog for you.

So there are different things that can cause brain fog.

But what I want to focus on is the complex trauma part because I think it's the main part.

And I think it's the most important part for most people.

And what it really is about, it's the brain's way of trying to help a child survive in very severe trauma.

So the child is facing extreme danger.

Something that if the child was to look at accurately, if the child was to see clearly, it would be too much, too overwhelming.

Because the child doesn't have the tools or support to deal with it.

So for the brain to let the child process and see this terrible thing accurately would do tremendous damage to the child.

So what the brain does to protect that child is to cause brain fog.

It causes the child's brain to start shutting down so that they're not able to process everything, to see everything.

To see everything accurately to protect the child.

It's not going to allow the child to go to this very painful, scary, stressful place because the child doesn't have the tools to handle that.

What the brain does, and now we'll go to the kind of the science, the chemicals of that.

What the brain does to help is when there's severe stress, severe danger, severe pain, the brain kicks in the sympathetic nervous system.

And that means it kicks in a shot of cortisol.

And cortisol fires up the adrenaline system so that the person now has energy to fight or flight.

But cortisol, what happens with cortisol in the brain is it shuts down the cortex.

It says we don't have time to think about what to do.

We got to get to our brain stem and our limbic system and just react.

We have to make a decision to survive and we got to pick the one that looks like it's going to lead to immediate safety.

So let's not weigh out all kinds of options.

We got to go into action mode.

So that's the design of cortisol.

Shut down the thinking, get into the limbic and brainstem so we can act to survive.

The problem with complex trauma is that cortisol is pumping all the time.

And what we're going to see is that that begins to negatively affect the brain.

But also when a person gets to adult life, that system, the stress system can get activated very easily.

They're often in it as a default setting.

And so cortisol is what causes the brain fog.

That's the bottom line.

It's about cortisol.

But there's one other piece to this.

If the danger gets more severe and cortisol is not enabling the child to fight or flight, they're too little.

The brain brings in another chemical, natural opioids, and that shuts down things even further.

That takes a person to the dorsal vagal system or that it puts them into freeze mode.

It puts them almost to a cataclysmic state.

It puts them into catatonic, a dissociative mode.

And that sets them up for even greater brain fog.

They retreat into an inner world and their ability to be present and engage the present world kind of disappears.

And so two chemicals are working to create brain fog, cortisol and opioids.

What's really important for people in recovery to understand is this.

So we've been looking at cortisol being produced or opioids being produced because your external circumstances are too painful or stressful.

And the brain says, don't have the tools to deal with it.

Don't have the supports to deal with it.

So we have to blur reality so that we protect the person.

That's key.

Secondly, what can happen is if a person starts to heal and they're going into deeper inner worlds and accessing deeper wounds, the brain might actually say, not ready to go there.

To go to that wound would be opening a can of worms that is way too painful.

So as they are in the recovery journey starting to heal and they start getting close to a core painful issue, they might actually experience brain fog.

Because their brain is saying, don't want to go there.

Don't think I'm ready to go there.

So let's start blurring everything again.

So the bottom line is brain fog is not just about protecting a person from present day stress and pain.

It's also about protecting them from hidden pain.

So be aware of that in your recovery journey.

Now I want to read to you.

A bunch of kind of scientific researchers and what they say about cortisol and the brain.

Just to really drive home what I've said in very general terms.

So Stericina researcher says this.

Things can go particularly awry when it comes to moments of heightened emotional stress or trauma.

There's a well-documented effect called the weapon focus effect.

If you're held at gunpoint, all your attention is focused on the weapon.

The most threatening item on the scene.

That hijacks all your attentional resources onto that gun and it leads to the failure to perceive the rest of the scene.

So when there's danger, your brain becomes hyper focused on the danger and it just overlooks everything else.

So that's one piece.

Dr.

Chloe wrote Roland a clinical psychologist says this.

It's an interesting really interesting function of the brain part of your brain.

Namely the hippocampus the main memory hub and the amygdala the so-called emotion center basically go offline because of the chemicals like cortisol that are released at the point of intense stress.

So you don't fully lay down the memory of what's happening then.

Because the memories are essentially offline when things begin to come back.

They appear to be fragmented.

So one result of cortisol is it prevents memories from getting laid down smoothly.

And then when you try to recall it's just pieces and fragments.

Dr.

Jolene Brighton a study following a famous cohort called the Framington Heart Study found that higher cortisol levels especially in women.

Were linked to poor.

Performance in memory organization visual perception and attention.

The study comprised over 2000 participants primarily in their 40s.

Those with higher cortisol levels also were associated with physical alterations to the brain which became linked to dementia and Alzheimer's disease.

Dr.

Krishnan.

So what's causing the blockage.

Of information in your brain.

Well there's no death definitive answer.

One idea is that your body's immune system response could cause inflammation in your brain.

What causes your body's inflammation response stress and cortisol.

So when inflammation occurs this could cause a temporary blockage in processing information.

Brain fog can be caused by chronic stress.

Hormonal changes and blood sugar imbalances.

Brain fog is a sort of manifestation of some type of inflammation or chronic stress response.

Chronic stress can have secondary effects.

It's impacts your sleep your nutrition and your physical ability.

Those secondary issues can lead to or be associated with psychiatric disorders.

So what we're seeing.

Is all of this cortisol in the brain.

It causes brain fog but it can begin to cause dementia Alzheimer's other psychiatric disorders.

It is taking its toll on the brain.

But then it affects physical stuff sleep autoimmune stuff it and we've done a talk on it.

It is just got a profound negative effect suppress cortisol.

Several other studies have noted that cortisol impacts brain volume in regions known to affect cognition including gray matter which is vital for processing information and the hippocampus which is essentially for memory.

So long-term effects of cortisol.

It affects the brain's volume how big the brain is in certain areas and that can then cause that you slide into brain fog.

Much more easily.

Than other person would.

I found it interesting just to kind of back away from this and look at Kate.

We're looking at cortisol and we're looking at cortisol and brain fog.

But just so you're aware.

What else does high cortisol levels do so.

It's connected to anxiety depression and irritability.

It's connected to muscle weakness fatigue and sleep problems.

So.

When there's a lot of cortisol happening people can either get weight gain or unexplained weight loss.

It can go either way for them some when there's ongoing cortisol happening.

It changes their skin.

So there's a thinning of the skin.

They easily bruise.

There's stretch marks that easily happen.

It definitely affects your whole digestive system.

So you have digestive issues irritable bowel diarrhea constipation.

Crohn's disease nausea all of that excessive cortisol.

Then high blood pressure headaches memory problems and then brain fog.

So this cortisol issue is just massive.

Aaron Tribby says this if you ever felt like stress affects the way you think.

Here's some of the few consequences of high cortisol levels on the brain.

So the amygdala hippocampus.

The prefrontal cortex are the most affected areas of the brain by cortisol together.

They control your emotions.

You're learning your memory your executive function and decision-making.

So cortisol is going to affect all of those negatively and that's what we've been looking at.

Then you have mild cognitive impairment which is sometimes a precursor to dementia or Alzheimer's disease.

And again connected to elevated cortisol levels.

So you're learning your brain's response to stress.

So over exposure to cortisol can kill off brain cells and so smaller brain volume.

HPA activity which is your response to stress has been linked which releases cortisol has been linked to more rapid decline in patients with Alzheimer's disease.

Now I need to just add one piece here.

So what we've looked at is that one of the brain's responses.

When a child is facing something very scary is to shut down the brain.

But there are other responses that some they become their go-to more than brain fog.

Or there might be a blend of brain fog plus these other ways of coping.

So let me just give them to you.

So a person when they're facing something very scary very stressful.

All of a sudden they just want to change the subject.

They don't want to talk about it anymore.

They want to talk about something else.

So that's their way of kind of diverting the brain's attention to something less stressful.

Or they might want to just go do something else.

So they need a distraction.

They need to get away from that circumstance and go find something else to do.

So that's why people all sudden want to do a mindless numbing task.

They can think of all kinds of little jobs they'd like to do just to distract themselves.

Others.

When they're in a very painful situation and the topic is scary or stressful.

They divert attention of everybody else from the topic onto themselves.

And they go look at me and here's what's going on in my life.

And all of a sudden if I can be the center of attention then the painful topic isn't the center of attention.

Others as soon as the topic is getting too painful they can't sit still.

They get extremely agitated.

They got to get up.

They got to move their foot starts dancing because the pressure is building inside.

And sometimes they'll get angry get very irritable and lash out at people.

That's their way of trying to avoid that topic.

So those are just some other things that can happen for people.

The brain fog is a symptom.

So the danger is to think.

I just need to fix the symptom.

If you try to fix the symptom without fixing the real issue, which is there's too much stress in your life right now.

You're never really going to fix the brain fog.

So understand the real issue is the stress brain fog is the symptom.

Now there's going to be some things we can do to help with that symptom in the moment.

But the key thing is you have to begin to look at the.

Stress of your life.

That's the key problem.

That's what's got to get attention.

That's what's got to change.

That's what's got to get fixed.
