## Problem Statement

Mental health professionals face a critical training gap: they must master challenging therapeutic scenarios (crisis intervention, trauma response, difficult dialogues) but cannot safely practice these skills with real vulnerable populations. Traditional training methods are limited by:

- **Risk to Real People**: Cannot practice crisis scenarios with actual clients
- **Limited Exposure**: Rare but critical scenarios may not occur during training
- **Bias Blind Spots**: Unconscious biases go undetected and uncorrected
- **Inconsistent Feedback**: Feedback quality varies by supervisor availability and expertise
- **Scalability Issues**: One-on-one supervision doesn't scale to meet training demand

## User Personas
