Can the golden child turn into the scapegoat?  And so here is what one of our community members said.  I am not proud of it, but I used to be my mom's golden child.  Everything I did was praised.  Now I cannot do anything right and it feels like I have become the scapegoat.  What causes this switch in narcissistic families and why does it happen?  Okay, wonderful question.  I want people to think about how the nature of a narcissist is never consistent.  Part of their presentation is to be inconsistent.  And the method or the reasoning for that is to keep everyone destabilized and always trying to pursue that approval piece, that sense of stability or consistency.  So what I like to think of is if the narcissist is always inconsistent to create chaos, the child is in some way trying to figure out how to maintain something that feels predictable, consistent.  It's a way of them regulating their own mood or the mood of the narcissist.  So again, going back to, if they have been feeling like the golden child, like they are celebrated, like everything they do is quite meaningful for the narcissist, well, that makes them feel good.

But that does not really have the longevity the narcissist would maybe want them to have because the narcissist is still looking for a way to get their own needs met, which means if the golden child is achieving all of these things, in a way, the narcissist is not really getting their supply.  It's only as good as it's good.  So if the things are being achieved, there still is this potential unsettling energy within the narcissist because they need to create chaos.  They need to create a sense of that power dynamic.  And so it does them no good in a way to just let a child settle into a role.  They want to cause a bit of a disruption in that role so that it destabilizes the child.  And I am saying even an adult child.  I am just using that as the term of the child, of course, to then feel a little uncomfortable that they were not good enough.  Something has happened.  How did they lose favor?  They lost the narcissist.  So once they realize something is going on and they are being ridiculed, they are being devalued, it has the potential to reignite that energy of going after something a little bit more and making the narcissist be kind of reminded, I still can control you.  I am still able to destabilize you and cause you to lose sense of who you are and still depend on me and what my approval is, what my needs are to still be the main, I guess, focus.  And I think that's the key to the relationship.  Okay.  So you are saying golden child definitely can turn into the scapegoat.  And the reason that this can, this switch can happen or like what causes this switch is because the inconsistency piece that you just said that the very nature within narcissistic individuals is this inconsistency.  And it also enforces their control when they kind of can disrupt the family dynamics and everybody is like very, insecure about their stance there.  And okay, so that causes it.  I was also kind of thinking about myself before this meeting with you today.  Is this a separate thing or does this go under what you just said, but loss of idealization?  So because golden child, if you think about it, represents kind of the narcissist in a positive view, like, so, yes, I mean, because you speak at the same time.  So does the measurement though make sense is not it?  Does√§ it make sense, in that way?  Well, I see you already Ineuse it is.

But when I see in zoom, but.  Yes, Sit back.  I guess, he's going to be over there in a second and.  I may be going for Fuck the PowerPoint more.

But.  So do not subscribe platinum chat wedding.  And let's say I, alpha Congressman they were.  Yes, the golden.  Yes.  So the Golden Child loses their kind of aquele porsche, kind of this favorite favorite favorite role because they no longer meet the narcissistic parents unrealistic expectations so they let's say they make a mistake or they do not succeed in a way that flatters the narcissistic parent anymore and this happens because they have kind of idealized they see themselves through the child like they have idealized image of themselves and through the golden child and when the golden child fails they feel almost like betrayed like yes how can you fail exactly when i have already been encouraged or i felt like i had the attention and the positive reinforcement from the narcissistic parent what happened but yes absolutely i mean again i go back to what the narcissist needs which is not to feel like anyone else understands any predictability and what they are looking for it really always comes back to it's never going to be enough it will never ever be enough so it does set up a child as you just said to feel like i have always done everything i thought right what happened that i fell out of favor why did i do that what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me what happened to me why was that not good enough when it was good enough yesterday you know it was always something i i i do not know if i should use an example or not but i i just quickly i remember talking to a client once that talked about how everything was always perfect and they were always making sure everything was perfect and one day out of the blue something they did that they had always done they just found one little criticism to judge them and it really unraveled them and caused them to feel again confused and lost and critical of themselves and very guilty and very shame-based because just one small thing it was not even anything in my opinion meaningful but enough to let that person i think that's what you are saying to feel like i thought i had it figured out and was this was this client of yours like golden child usually yes at the time because those roles but at the time again it was their own ability to feel like they had mastered what they thought they needed because they meant you know it was you know safe and everything was achieved and they felt connected and they felt the predictability of what they needed and they felt the predictability of what they needed to feel connection to the narcissist so again it's just it's just part of the game of a narcissist you will never perhaps ever really feel that consistency in any of the roles that you think you need to be in in order to maintain a connection it does not work for the narcissist they still need to in some way destabilize you to keep that power differential in place and cause you to feel like you are losing your mind yes i think that's a good ad because i believe it might be sometimes kind of common misconception that oh it's a global problem and i think that's a good idea to have a golden child and then you are like oh it's a golden child or a golden child is always a golden child scapegoat is always the scapegoat but in reality they are actually very fluid ever changing creating that uncertainty okay yes yes it's the chaos and the drama of the family and those roles move very quickly sometimes sometimes they are not so quick so maybe they are not as noticeable and they might be a little more gradual and then all of a sudden you realize something shifted and then other families depending on the energy of the narcissist because we know it's on a continuum those roles might switch very very quickly causing even more chaos within the family system and uncertainty of who am i in this system okay so are you saying like to simplify to be the more narcissistic the person is on the others on the continuum the more likely it is that the roles shift even faster is that what you say yes yes sometimes that mood energy from the narcissist if they are very temperamental because narcissists show up a little bit differently right i do not want to get too off the the topic there but again i do not think it's it's good for people to think maybe a one-size-fits-all when we are talking about the word narcissist because that word is flung out in so many different conversations now i think you still need to understand yes there's some general common pieces to it but if you have a very very temperamental narcissist who is even more likely to erupt or to be to shift that mood because some are a little more sullen they are a little more victimized they are a little more of that depressed piece so people might be able to manage some of that mood a little bit better but if they are very active on on a more regular basis then that can cause maybe those roles to be a little more shifting fast because that energy feels more threatening yes that actually makes me think of like this one idea that I came across that also kind of stress can intensify those like role changes because narcissists they are very unable to regulate their emotions so then they lash out to whoever is closest so it does not matter if it's a golden child but if there's someone else in that moment and they cannot like deal with whatever so they can just offload their frustration no matter if it's the golden child or scapegoat so that might also like and that probably creates a lot of confusion for their child because they might not have done anything they have thought that they are like now now it's been very good season I am like kind of doing everything okay then something happens and it's actually caused by the parents inability to regulate their emotions and something happens and they you know they cannot handle it and they just are very frustrated and yes yes the thing I was also going to mention based on what you said is if you think about a child who's an only child in a narcissistic family then obviously they are prone to serve many roles depending on what is going on so that's an example of maybe a person understanding maybe it does get confusing if you have got multiple siblings that are you know have different roles within the family but one child can equally flip-flop into different roles depending on what the narcissist needs so yes they can be valued and then devalued very quickly and I think that you know again one of the hallmarks of a narcissist is they are attracted to something that they want to boast about because you are an extension of them so for a while it can be that they are going to really celebrate you but they cannot tolerate feeling like somebody deserves that kind of treatment because it goes against their fragile ego so that's why also there would be an intolerance of maybe celebrating a person too much because they are not strong enough to manage I am good and so are you no no if I am saying you are good and you are perfect at all these things that's starting to threaten my own sense of who I am so I have got to remind myself of how you are all of them so you have a sense of it it's not like I do not know or you know so either that's like a real risk to you it's a real risk to an adult it's not like you know I do not know how to go about it if you are an adult or if you are an adult and you are also capable of not being as good as I am telling you you are, because I have to reclaim some sense of my own inner security in myself.  So I will devalue you to remind myself how good I am at your expense.  Yes.  Because I cannot do it on my own.  Yes.  Okay.  So now to conclude, if the question is like, can the golden child turn into the scapegoat?  Short answer, yes.  And then how would you summarize, like, what causes this switch?  And why does it happen?  If you had to make a tweet about this.  Oh, good God.  I think the tweet would just simply be something along the line of narcissists are not consistent because their egos will not tolerate consistency.  They are too susceptible.  So they need to create confusion and chaos.  They cannot let you feel safe.  That's it.  Yes.  You are never going to feel safe.  So it's going to shift all the time.  Okay.  Yes.  Thank you.  That was good.  Okay.
