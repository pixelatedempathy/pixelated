We have started a new series where we are looking at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma in more detail than we have looked at them in the past.  Hopefully taking it to a little bit of a deeper level for you who are watching and are working on your own trauma issues.  And tonight I want to come to the third one I want to talk about, the fear of abandonment.  I would say that next to shame, this is one of the most devastating aspects of complex trauma.  Many people do not even realize the devastating effect that it's had on their life, how they look at themselves, how they approach relationships, how it really takes much of life and makes it into negative stuff.  And that's what I want to develop today.  So let me just say up front that there may be many of your friends who walk around and appear to be very happy.

But if you were to explore their life, you would find a deep fear of abandonment.  That is probably from a subconscious level guiding some of their behaviors and affecting their relationships negatively.  So let me begin by just explaining kind of how complex trauma results in this fear of abandonment.  And then we will just look at whether you have the fear of abandonment as part of your life either consciously or subconsciously.  So complex trauma is not entirely the result of living in a dangerous environment.  What it is is living in a dangerous environment with no one to help you, so that you feel you are facing this dangerous environment all alone.  And so the ones that are supposed to be there for you, teachers and parents and people in authority are not.  And so you feel abandoned.  You might have people physically in your life, but you do not feel that they are actively involved in caring for you, protecting you.  You feel all alone.  And I think after my years of working in this field that the feeling of abandonment is probably one of the deepest emotional pains that a person can experience.  There's not much more of a painful emotion than abandonment.  Nothing says more loudly to a child that they do not matter than that when they are abandoned emotionally or physically.  And so it says you are not lovable, you are not valuable, nothing communicates the shame message louder than abandonment.  And complex trauma basically is about children feeling abandoned.  And so what happens with that is they go, they go, this feels so bad.  I never want to experience it again.  And so they develop a fear of being abandoned again, but this is where it gets very tricky.  They become an internal contradiction.  They fear abandonment and they work hard to prevent being abandoned again, but yet they are convinced at a core belief level that everybody that gets to know them will abandon them.  So they are working not to be abandoned, but convinced they will be abandoned.  And that is what makes this such a devastating thing.  It shapes what you believe about yourself and relationships and other people.  And so what I want to look at is just, is that a part of your psyche, your belief system?  Because if it is, it is doing a lot of damage whether you realize it or not.  And if I can help you understand how it's affecting you, then you can begin working at changing it.  Now let me add one more thing.  Children who feel abandoned by their parents or authorities, they become convinced that they are not lovable, that they must be a terrible mistake, and they abandon themselves.  And they begin to not even want to connect with themselves, they do not want a relationship with themselves.  Living in their own skin is a terrible thing, all because they have abandoned themselves.  So they have been abandoned by others, and now they abandon themselves.  So now when they are in the middle of a crowd of people, they can feel all alone.  They do not even have a relationship with themselves, let alone others.  So let me look at, do you have the fear of abandonment inside of you, either at a conscious level or a subconscious level?

I want to give you 36 characteristics of people with the fear of abandonment.  And again you can check off the ones that apply to you and do this as a test so that you become aware of whether this is an issue for you or not.  So the first characteristic of a person with the fear of abandonment is when they meet somebody they like, instead of gradually getting to know them, they try to attach too quickly.  And it's basically saying, I do not want to go through the time of getting to know a person in a healthy way, because if I do I might risk losing them.  So let's just attach really, really quickly with great intensity, that will increase my chances that they will not abandon me.  Secondly, you move out of a relationship too quickly or thirdly you stay in an unhealthy relationship too long.  So the first one, some people with fear of abandonment issues, basically they go about relationships this way.  One strike you are out, I am not giving you a second chance, I am not going to try to work it out and resolve it with you.  You hurt me, you are out of my life, I am never giving you another opportunity to hurt me.  Or second one, I am afraid of being abandoned so I will accept crumbs of love and I will stay in a very unhealthy even abusive relationship, because I do not want to be alone, because that is being abandoned.  And so you stay in a relationship too long.  Next one, you are reluctant to fully invest in a relationship.  So you always need an escape hatch.  You shy away from a full commitment to a relationship, because after all they are probably going to abandon me eventually, so I do not want to fully commit or invest in this relationship you hold back.  And that leads to the next one where you avoid emotional intimacy.  If a person gets to know me well, you are convinced they will leave you, they will abandon you.  So you try to have lots of fun and superficial intimacy, but you avoid deep real intimacy for fear they will abandon you.  And so you keep walls around your heart, you keep masks on, you do not let them see the real you.  Shame we have already talked about, the loudest message that comes out of abandonment is you are not good enough.  That's why I abandon you, the child takes it personally.  And so shame is huge for people who have been abandoned.  They do not feel they are lovable or valuable.  That leads to the next one.  Therefore they do not feel they are worthy of love.  Now they have to earn love because they are not worthy just the way they are.  They have many insecurities where they like my appearance and my too fat and my too thin.  All of those things because if you do not find me perfect to you, you will abandon me.  So now you are insecure about your personality, your weight, your body, how you talk, all kinds of different things.  And then you struggle to trust people because everybody that you have trusted as a child has let you down and abandon you.  So you are afraid to trust because then you are opening yourself up to get hurt in an even greater way, you think.  Then you are jealous.  So if your friend or your partner makes another friendship or is talking to somebody immediately you feel jealousy because you are afraid they are going to value that person more than you and abandon you.  So jealousy is a huge issue for people with abandonment issues.  Some go into their head in their mind on a regular basis and visualize their partner leaving them.  Almost like they are watching it happen as a prediction in their mind.  Then another one, when your partner is away for a couple of days, let's say on a business trip, you go through depression.  You go through the feelings as if they left you forever separation blues.  And then everything somebody does to you, you overanalyze.  What was their motive?  Why did they do that?  Did they mean this?  Did they mean that?  Because you are afraid they are going to abandon you.  Then you are hypersensitive to criticism, to disrespect.  So anything somebody says by way of advice or points out something you did that was not right or could have been done better, you go, oh, they do not like me anymore, they are going to abandon me.  Lots of repressed anger.  So people who have been abandoned, that is so wrong.  They feel a righteous, a good anger, but they were not allowed to express it so they repress it.  And that anger is there big time now and it comes out if their fear of abandonment gets triggered today.  They explode with anger.  Another one, people who have been abandoned tend to be quite controlling because if I control, can control you then you will not abandon me because I will make sure you do not.  So I will control who you see what activities you are involved in, the use of your time, all of that to avoid abandonment.  What is interesting is they pick emotionally unavailable people to get into a close relationship with.  They pick people who feel safe because they are not going to pride, they are not going to dig, but yet they are not able to connect.  And so it sets up that they are going to eventually abandon you.  If the relationship starts to go really well, fear surfaces and then they go, oh, oh, something bad is about to happen.  This is too good to be true and they sabotage good relationships because of the fear that I do not want to get my hopes up because I know they are going to abandon me eventually.  Then if the relationship does break up, they tend to blame themselves.  They tend to say it's mainly my fault as to why it broke up.  Next one, when they meet somebody that is a potential partner, they study them carefully looking for flaws.  Because they want to spot any flaw because that increases the probability that person will abandon them.  And so now they are not trying to look at a partner accurately or even look at their positive qualities, they are looking for their flaws, their weaknesses.  And that sets a relationship on the road to trouble.  Then they can copy other people's personalities.  So they see somebody that everybody seems to like.  Everybody wants to be a friend with.  And so they think if I am like that person, then that's what will happen to me.  So I will copy their personality.  And so they become like other people.  They wear these masks in order to please people.  They are afraid to set boundaries with people because if I set a boundary with you, if I say no to you, you might get mad at me and leave me.  So I will not set boundaries or they do not deal well with other people setting boundaries with them.  So if you say no to me, you are calling me too much.  I need you to slow that down.  That feels like rejection which feels like you are getting ready to abandon me.  So they do not like boundaries.  They are a people pleaser.  And that comes out.  I need you to like me all the time so you will not abandon me.  So I will do whatever you want.  And then in a relationship instead of it being equal, I am giving just as much as you are giving.  I am sacrificing just as much as you are sacrificing.  It's I will give more than you so that you will not leave me.  And that results in I will be willing to give up my needs, my morals in order to please you so that you will not abandon me.  So the relationship is set up as a relationship of inequality.  You give more than the other person consistently and you let them run the relationship.  And then you feel responsible for the other person's emotion.  So if they are sad or angry, you panic.  They must be getting ready to leave me.  They do not like me anymore.  And so you work overtime to try and make them happy to try and take their anger away so that they will not abandon you.  Some people with fear of abandonment always need to be the center of attention.  They always want the spotlight on them.  They always want to be noticed because they think if everybody is noticing me, then they are going to validate me and then they are going to want to stay with me.  When you are in a relationship and something happens that you perceive as negative, there's some tension, there's some conflict, there's a disagreement, or the partners a bit down, sad, stressed out, you go to worst case scenario.  Oh, oh, this is all about they must be unhappy with me and they are getting ready to abandon me.  So you jump to the worst case scenario.  Does not matter what people do, you twist what they say, their actions, their motives to try and set it up that yes, they are probably going to abandon me.  So even though you fear abandonment, you expect it, so you twist everything to support, yes, that person's going to abandon me, yes, that person's going to abandon me.  And then many people who have fear of abandonment, they end a relationship that's going through trouble, they end it before the other person does so that they can never say they were abandoned by somebody but that they abandoned that person.  So I was never abandoned because I ended the relationship first.  Next one, what they use to try to convince themselves the other person is not going to abandon them, is we have intense feelings for each other.  And so the measure of closeness, the measure of the health of the relationship, the measure of the fact that a person will not abandon me, is we have so much intensity, so many intense positive feelings in our relationship and sex is often the way they try to produce that.  So that becomes the barometer, the intensity that is felt.  Next one is key, they have a hard time not being in a relationship.  You see, if they are in a relationship, that proves to them that they must be lovable because somebody wants to be with them.  If they are not in a relationship, then that seems to prove that they are not lovable, the thing that they fear.  And so they will stay in relationships, they will stay in a bad relationship just so they will not be alone.  And some people, if they see a relationship falling apart, before they end it, they will go and get another relationship ready to move into so that they are not alone.  Being alone is the worst condition in their mind because it proves everything that they are trying to disprove.  Then they will make false conclusions about people's motives, they do not have any proof, they just jump to these conclusions.  So let me give an example.  Somebody's really nice wants to be their friend, wants to spend time with them, and their brain is saying they do not really love me, they are just wanting to use me.  No evidence, they just jump there.  Or somebody just is giving them very encouraging positive feedback on a regular basis, validating them, and their brain goes, well, they talk nice to my face, but they are probably talking crap about me behind my back.  Or they come in home one day, or to see a friend one day and the friend is busy doing something and the friend just says, oh, hi, how are you?  And they do not show the normal excitement.  And so they go, oh, they are probably getting tired of me, they probably do not like me anymore, and they jump to that conclusion.  Or if a person is saying nice things to them on a regular basis, they go, oh, yes, they just filter out all the bad things they are thinking, and just say positive, but they are thinking the bad things.  And then if you see your friend talking to somebody else and laughing with that person, you go, Kate, they are probably planning to start a relationship with them.  So all of these assumptions are being made all the time without any evidence.  Then the next one is huge.  People with a fear of abandonment tend to play games when they are in relationships.  So one of the things they will do is they will kind of push the person away.  They will not be as talkative with them.  They will not be as warm with them.  Why?  To see if the person will chase them.  Or they will go similar, they will go kind of in communicado for a couple of days.  They will not answer their texts.  They will not arrange to talk to them or visit them just to see how the person responds.  Are they going to come chasing me?  Or they might say the person, you do not really love me.  You are just saying that to test whether the person says, oh, yes, I do.  Yes, I do.  Or accusing them, you are planning to leave me or you are cheating on me just to see how they respond.  Or you put yourself down, I am surprised you are with me.  I am such a loser.  I am just a terrible partner just to see how they respond.  Or some even go as far as, you know, have you ever checked out that person over there?  I wonder if they would be, if you got rid of me, whether they would be a good partner, just to see how they respond.  Can you imagine though in a healthy relationship with somebody, did that how tiresome that would become?  How you would get to the point where you say, you know what?  I do not need this constant game playing.  I might have here.  And what we are going to see is that people with a fear of abandonment actually create the very thing they are trying to prevent.  They drive people away.  They create an environment that people eventually say, okay, I have had enough and abandoned them.  The next one is very critical as well.  People with abandonment issues often have very unrealistic expectations about relationships.  So you think of a child who's been abandoned and their brain is saying, I never want to be abandoned again.  So what do I need to do or look for in other people to guarantee you will never be abandoned again?  Number one, they must only love me.  If they have affection for anybody else, then there's a chance they might abandon me.  So they must only love me and give up all other relationships, friendships, even family.  That is so unrealistic, but that happens.  Secondly, they must never fail.  They must be perfect.  If they fail me, then they might turn out to be not a good person who will abandon me.

So, if they have a flaw, I am going to find it because that is a predictor that they will abandon me.  And so they must be perfect as the expectation.  They must give me constant validation.  They must only say positive things about me.  They can never point out any of my flaws or also abandon me, unrealistic expectations.  They must never set boundaries with me.  They must let me do whatever I want and never say no to me.  Unrealistic, unhealthy, but to somebody abandoned it feels right.  They must give me constant attention.  And so you demand unrealistic amounts of time from them.  They cannot go out and spend a night with some of their guy friends or girlfriends.  They must spend every night with me.  They cannot just have their own little hobby that they do on their own.  They must give me constant attention and do everything with me.  Or else they do not love me.  And they abandon me.  Totally unrealistic and unhealthy.  If they get annoyed with me, if they give me advice, then that proves they are going to leave me so they can never be frustrated with me.  They can never give me advice.  Unrealistic.

But that's what the brain is thinking.

So, how did you do on that?  If you got a lot of those, there's some abandonment issues I would suspect.

But you might say, okay, so what's the big deal?  Sure, I got abandonment issues.  Well, I want you now to think about the long-term effects.  So what we saw initially is abandonment results in deep shame.  I am not good enough.  I am not lovable or valuable.

But more than that, it drives people away.  You create what you are trying to prevent.  So if you are clinging, if you are controlling, if you smother them, if you demand constant attention and unrealistic expectations, healthy people are going to say, that's two unhealthy relationship.  I cannot put up with that.  And I am going to walk away from it.  You drive people away.  And that means you are cutting out of your life the very healthy people you need in your life to have good relationships.  So you are setting yourself up to only end up in unhealthy relationships.  And that will cause ongoing damage to you, to other people, to children.  And then beyond that, the longer that you give into the fear of abandonment and play the games into all of that stuff, you keep feeding jealousy, anger, anxiety, depression, trust issues, you are feeding all of the wrong behaviors and wrong emotions inside of you.  So fear of abandonment exacts a great cost, a high cost from people.  It takes its toll on people all in a negative way.

Now, I just want to point out a couple of things.  If you are to look at abandonment in light of the attachment disorders, so attachment theory, such an important part of understanding complex trauma.  So if you look at abandonment, it explains some of the attachment disorders.  So avoid an attachment style is basically a person who does not open up to people, does not trust people.  Appears very distant, private, withdrawn.  You cannot get close to them.  That's an abandonment source cause.  Anxious attachment style is a person who's clingy, a person who smothers the other person, who's always wanting to be with the other person, who's very dependent on that person and tries to get that person dependent on them.  That's abandonment.  So abandonment, if you understand it, then helps you understand attachment disorder better.  Next thing, borderline personality disorder.  It is an abandonment issue.  So think of it this way.  People with borderline personality disorder, they appear normal, 95% of the time.  They are great at their job, they are great with friends, but at home in their most intimate relationships, they can get triggered.  And when they get triggered, they go ballistic.  All this anger comes out.  They lash out at people.  They have this compelling, you need, I need to fix this now, but you cannot reason with them.  They are somewhat irrational.  And so what they have found with borderline personality is abandonment is the thing that gets triggered.  Abandonment is what causes this emotional dysregulation, this emotional escalation from 0 to 100 in a nanosecond.  So understanding that personality disorder is an abandonment issue.  It is the way people learn to try to cope with feelings of abandonment and the fear of abandonment.  So let's go to healing.  If you realize you have abandonment issues and you have this fear of abandonment, I really am glad if you are now aware of it because now you can begin to change it.  Now it does not have to damage you anymore, but understand this.  It is very, very difficult to change because this is a deep, deep wound that took place usually early in life.  And it wounded your soul more than anything else.  And you just do not get over that.  There's not a magic pill for that.  And so the healing from abandonment is very gradual.  So it begins by understanding your healing, your shame, your learning, you have value, and we have done a whole series on shame.  I will not go back into that.  Second thing you need to understand is being in a relationship will not fix you.  Your partner cannot fix your abandonment issues.  You have to do that yourself in healing your shame.  If you put the expectation on somebody else to heal your abandonment issues, you are putting too much pressure on them to do something that is impossible for them to do and you are destroying the relationship.  So the third thing, build a relationship with yourself.  Start with understanding, not only was I abandoned, I abandoned myself.  So the place to begin is connecting with myself, becoming a friend with myself.  And what that means for many people is that they build a relationship for the little them.  When they were that little boy, they are kind of connecting again to that little boy who was abandoned and they still feel that little boy or girl inside themselves.  And so that means that you take time each day to connect with yourself, you are kind to yourself, you forgive yourself, you do not beat yourself up all the time.  And as you begin to connect to yourself and become your own best friend, that is the greatest first step, the main step in healing your abandonment issues.  Not easy for many.  And so some do journaling, some do inner child work, some just learned times of meditation to connect with themselves.  Some catch all the negative self-talk, the internal critic that yaps away in their brain, the brain chatter, and they start shutting that down and replacing it with kind words.  All of those things are important to begin not abandoning yourself, to connect with yourself.  Then gradually, emphasis gradually, develop a healthy connection with at least one other person, not romantic, but just connection where you are able to be authentic.  So that person has to be safe, that person has to be working on their stuff.  And so you begin to form relationships, and that starts to heal the abandonment, because as you start forming this friendship, all of the fears come up of abandonment.

But you realize that's my limbic brain getting triggered, I do not have to give into it, I do not have to jump the worst case scenario.  I would choose to continue to be authentic and gradually develop this relationship.  And if they prove trustworthy, I will keep developing it even more.  And that starts to heal deep abandonment issues.  For some people, they have a safe person that they build a relationship, but they also find building a relationship with their higher power is also very important.  So this becomes essential.  You can heal a lot of your abandonment issues, alone just building a relationship with yourself, but not all of them.  You need to start building relationships, and as they get closer and you take down the walls and the moss, it will trigger deeper and deeper abandonment issues.  Then know your triggers for when you feel somebody's going to abandon you.  So maybe somebody sets a boundary with you, that triggers you, or even a close friend moves to another city.  That feels like a abandonment, and so you get triggered.  Or you phone somebody, but they cannot talk right now, and they say, sorry, cannot talk and hang up.  Or your good friend develops another friendship besides his friendship with you.  Know your triggers, self-awareness is essential.  And again, realize that your triggers trigger the limbic brain, and the limbic brain wants to take over, and the limbic brain wants to say what I am feeling is the truth.  So I am feeling that because the person set a boundary with me, they are rejecting me and are going to abandon me, that must be the truth.

But that is emotional reasoning, it may not be the truth at all.  So you do not have to listen to your limbic brain, but that's what's getting triggered, and it gets triggered in a powerful way.  So if triggered, then you have to figure out how to deescalate and get out of your limbic brain back into your cortex.  Also, once you are back into your cortex, identify the lies your limbic brain, try to get you to believe lies that would have sabotaged relationships, recovery.  Then remind yourself of the truth, and do not feed into the limbic brain stuff.  So if you feel jealousy, do not feed into the jealousy.  If you feel the person might be pulling away, do not feed into it by becoming clingy, and by quizzing them, and quizzing them, and testing them.  Get back into your cortex, and just continue building a relationship.

Now, let me end with this.  For some people, while they are dealing with their abandonment, which is great, initially they are not capable of a relationship.  If they get into a relationship, it will just trigger them too much, and they do not have the tools yet, or they are not strong enough to use the tools yet, and they will go right back to old behaviors.  So for many people, in the early days, it's important for them to stay out of relationships, and by that I mean romantic ones, and just give them self time to build a relationship with themself.  That is hard, but that is essential if you are going to start to heal and get strong enough to use the tools in a relationship.  Well, that's the fear of abandonment.  I really hope you are been able to see how big an issue this is, and the damage that it does, and that you have been able to recognize some of the unhealthy things in yourself, so that now you can begin to change those things, you can begin to heal, you can begin to grow in this area, and become capable of healthy intimate relationships.  Well, that's the end of part one.  We are going to take a short break, and then I am going to come back for the Christian part, if that does not interest you, that's fine, no offense taken, you are free to go for the rest of you, I will be back in a minute.  I am going to come back for the rest of you.  Well, welcome back.  We are looking at the life of Peter, one of the followers of Jesus, a man who became very influential, a great leader in the Jesus movement, and we have been looking at the vignettes that are told about him in the story, in the gospels that are written about Jesus.  And I hope you are finding the very informative, helpful, giving you insight into your own life, and helping you as you are on your journey of growing and healing in recovery.  And today we come to one that I think is just such a critical, important lesson, especially for people from complex trauma.  So let me read the passage in Matthew 17.  It says, on their arrival in Kaepernet, I mean, that's where Peter lived, and that's where Jesus had made his headquarters.  It was right on the sea of Galilee.  So they have returned there from being up in the north, and it says the collectors of the temple tax came to Peter and asked him, does not your teacher pay the temple tax?  Peter replies, yes, he does.  So Peter's been outside of his house, Jesus is inside the house.  And so these men corner Peter when he's outside.  So now he goes back inside.  And before he has a chance to say anything, Jesus says to Peter, what do you think Peter?  Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered?  Peter replies, well, they tax the people they have conquered.  Well, then Jesus said the citizens are free.  They are not taxed.

However, we do not want to offend them.  So go down to the lake and throw in a line, open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin, take it and pay the tax for both of us.  What's going on here?  So let me start with this temple tax.  So it was a tax paid by the citizens of Israel to help with the maintenance and the costs of running the temple.  Technically, it was an optional tax.  You did not have to pay it.

But what happened over the years is that people began to have the thinking that said, paying the temple tax is a sign that you are patriotic to Israel.  So remember, they were dominated by Rome.  They hated Rome.  So in their mind, if you paid the temple tax, it proved you were loyal to God in Israel.  If a person did not pay the tax, then the whispering started.  I wonder if they are loyal to Rome.  They definitely do not seem to be loyal to Israel.  And so it would create all kinds of conspiracy type stuff going on in the gossip and people would ostracize that person.  You did not pay the temple tax.  You are not a loyal Jew.  We want nothing to do with you.  And so it became a big deal.  So what is going on here in this point in time in Jesus' ministry is the religious leaders have had enough of Jesus.  They want to get rid of Him.

But they do not just want to come in and kill Him because that would make them look bad.  So their approach is we want to find a flaw in Jesus to discredit Him.  And if we can discredit Him, then the people will turn against Him and they will thank us for pointing out the flaw and it will all turn out good for us.  We will get the people's loyalty back.  Because right now it was to Jesus.  And so that's what they are doing here is they are sending somebody hoping to trap Jesus and discredit Him.  So back away and think of it this way.  And this is the complex trauma connection.  Jesus was working very hard to create with his disciples a safe, healthy, surrogate family.  He was treating them.  They were learning to treat each other in healthy ways with honesty, respect, forgiveness, love, all of that stuff.

But so one world that Jesus is living in is this healthy world, a safe world.

But there's another world Jesus lives in the culture of that time, which is the political culture and the religious culture.  Both are wanting to get rid of Him.  Both want to discredit Him.  It's an unsafe world.  So Jesus is living in an unsafe world and a safe world.  And that's what it's like for a lot of people in recovery.  They are building a surrogate family of safe people.

But yet they go home to their biological family and it's unsafe.  So they are using healthy tools in their safe family, but it's almost like they are back to survival tools in the other family, two different worlds.  And that's what's going on with Jesus.  So Jesus responds to this question about whether or not he pays the temple tax because they are hoping he does not, because then they can spread the word that he's not loyal to Israel, he's loyal to Rome.  So Jesus says to Peter, do the family of the king.  Does the family of the king have to pay a tax?  Peter goes, no.  And so he says, okay, we are talking about the temple here.  What's the temple?  It's the place where God dwells in Israel.  It's God's house, God's dwelling place.  Okay, and who am I?  I am the son of God.  So I am the son of the king that the temple is all about.  So technically I do not have to pay the temple tax because I am the son of the king.  So it would have been very easy for Jesus to say the fact that they are demanding I pay a temple tax is they are treating me unjustly because I am the king's son.  And he could have drawn a line in the sand and he could have said, I am going to stand up for myself right now and say, I do not have to pay it, I am the king's son.  And then he could even have added weight to what he his argument by saying those those temple people, they are corrupt and he could have given all kinds of examples of the corrupt leadership of the temple.  So he could have built a strong case as to why he did not have to pay the temple tax as to why he was being treated unjustly and he could have drawn a line in the sand and said a boundary.

But he does not why because there were other priorities greater than being treated justly.  At that point in Jesus ministry when they were wanting to get rid of him, Jesus knew they eventually work as he told us the site was I am going to Jerusalem to die and be crucified.

But there was a specific day on the calendar where Jesus was supposed to die and that was the Passover.  And he had to work very hard to avoid entrapment before the Passover date.  And so Jesus is saying God's plan says I cannot create right now unnecessary conflict unnecessary problems because that will mess things up with God's plan more than that.  My goal is to love the people.  My goal is to meet their deepest need.  Nobody else can meet their separation from God their brokenness that is caused then to be separated from God.  Nobody else can meet that spiritual need but me.  So if I am going to love those people, I need to die for those people on that date.  So God's plan and my love for people is a higher priority than being treated justly right now.  And so Jesus says I will allow myself to be treated unjustly so that I can meet a higher priority.  Now let me apply this to the people in recovery from complex trauma.  Usually the first thing that I know I am going to have to help people with is standing up for themselves, for drawing a line in the sand, for saying no to abuse of people, to saying no to injustice, to say I respect myself enough to not allow you to disrespect me.  Because most people coming into complex trauma are not good at that.  They have let people walk all over them.  They do not set healthy boundaries.  And so I want them to begin to be strong enough to do that and say I matter.

But there's a second thing that they will come to eventually.  And that is what Jesus did.  There will be times when they could stand up for themselves where they could draw a line in the sand and say technically you doing this to me is wrong.

But you know what I am going to allow it right now because there's a higher priority.  I need to not make this a battleground so that I can fulfill the higher priority of love.  Now it takes a while to learn when do I draw a line in the sand and when do I tolerate injustice because of a higher priority.  I cannot give you a magic answer to that.  A black and white thing every circumstance situation you take it case by case and think it through.  And I hope you have somebody that you can think it through with.

But that is such an important thing to begin to understand that there are two pieces to this whole thing about drawing a line in the sand.  The need to learn first of all to stand up for myself and then second there will be times when I choose not to stand up for myself not because I am afraid to but because of a higher priority.  Now let me end with this.  Jesus tells Peter go out and cast your line so take your fishing pole and go fishing and the first fish you catch is going to be a coin in its mouth take it and pay my taxes and your taxes.  There will be enough for both of us.  What is the point of that?  I cannot say for sure but here's what I think part of the point might be.  This is the third time that we are told that Jesus provides for Peter's physical needs miraculously.  So the first time when Jesus called him and said come and follow me he basically said give up your fishing business but on that day Peter gone fishing and not caught a thing.  And Jesus said go out and throw in your nets and Peter said okay and he came and his nets were fallen overflowing and Jesus miraculously provided for him and said Peter I want you to know that if you give up your fishing business I can still provide for you.

But then Jesus repeats it the feeding of the 15 to 20,000 people.  They a small boys lunch five loaves barley loaves two small fish and Jesus feeds all these people and then there's 12 baskets of leftovers one for each of the disciples.  Jesus miraculously provides for Peter and then now in this situation Jesus miraculously provides for Peter.  I wonder if Peter just needed extra evidence that maybe Peter this was a tough area for him to trust God.  I think all of us have certain areas that God just knows are our weakness that we will struggle to trust him in these areas.  And so he graciously kindly goes out of his way just to do special things to keep convincing us that he's trustworthy.  And I am so thankful for that.  And Peter became a person who learned to trust Jesus totally.  And I wonder if all of this was part of that.  Well, let's pray.  Father, I just thank you for this story.  Thank you that it is just full of such key lessons for us.  And I pray that again that you would just help each person in their life where they are at and just custom make what has been said tonight to meet them where they are at.  Amen.  Well, thank you again for being part of this Friday.  It's always my pleasure to just teach and share this with you.  We will see you next Friday.
