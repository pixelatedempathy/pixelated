I used to do a thing with clients where I gave them a list of things and I put need, want.

And they were to check which was a need and which was a want.

And some people, everything was a need.

A 55-inch television, need.

And just keep on going down, need, need, need.

And they did not know how to distinguish between a need and a want.

And that becomes very important in figuring out how to manage money well.

Secondly, work at a budget.

Get somebody to help you.

I used to do an exercise with clients where they would take how much money they got every week, two weeks, whatever, and then they would have to go through every expense they had.

Cigarettes, food, all the different things.

Do you want to know where most money went that they didn't even realize?

Eating out, coffee.

And all of a sudden they began to realize, wow, I can't believe how much money I'm spending here.

And so if you do that, that becomes a very important thing.

Okay, now I've seen people that have made the best budgets in the world and never followed them.

So you need to develop a self-control.

And basically, when Kim and I got married, we said this to each other, we are going to live within our means.

We're going to figure out a way to live within our means so that we don't spend more than we make.

And we were able to do that.

And it's possible, it takes work, but you can do that.

Next one, if you start to get money coming in, then you have to begin to think about saving and planning.

And so that, for some of you, you're not even close to that, that's fine.

But for those of you that are, give that some thought.

But here's the key thing.

If greed's the wrong attitude towards money, what's the right attitude?

It's contentment.

Contentment with what I have.

Doesn't mean it'd be nice to have this, but I am not going to sacrifice the important things of my life to get this and hurt those things.

I am content with what I have where I'm at.

And so learning contentment is a really thing.

And we're going to talk about that further in this series.

Final thing, many people in early recovery can't have a credit card or a debit card.

Give that some thought.

If you are beginning to realize that is tripping you up repeatedly, begin to look at cutting them up or giving them to somebody else so that it's not a temptation.

So, I hope this helps.

Some of you, when I mentioned that we're going to be talking about money, I got all this, oh, money.

It's such a problem area in my life.

I hope you see that it's an important area to get under control and to learn to be healthy in.

Okay, it's the Christian part and we've been going through or started looking at what I consider to be the best example in the Bible of complex trauma.

And it's when Israel, the people of Israel, about three million come out of slavery.

And they had spent generations being slaves, mistreated, etc.

by the Egyptian people.

So when they come out of that slavery, all of a sudden you see these people that have all the 60 characteristics of complex trauma that we talk about.

So I thought I would take you through this series to show you kind of how messed up they were so that you would begin to see yourself and see kind of how God responded to all of their complex trauma.

So what we did last week is I talked about the very first thing God did.

So I picture God as this perfect therapist, counselor, and so I'm sitting there going, what's the first thing He did in the very first session with these new clients that He's got who have severe complex trauma?

And so we said last week that a person with complex trauma is not going to heal unless they learn to trust.

But the problem is people who have lived all their life not trusting, well, that's the last thing they want to do.

Is trust.

And so trust becomes something they need but they resist.

And so God forces them into situations where they see how He faithfully provides for them even though they don't want to be in those positions.

And He takes them to things where they see His power, His commitment, His faithfulness, His love.

All of those are very important.

And so I say, what's the first thing God wants them to see?

And that's what we're going to look at tonight.

So here's what I, if you want to read, starting in Exodus 13, what you're going to find is the writer only picks certain scenes.

There are thousands of different things happening, but he just picks one here, one here, one here.

And I go, why did he pick those particular scenes?

Why did he pick those scenes?

Why did he pick those particular events?

And as I think about it, I think he's wanting us to show what God had to do in what order to bring about healing in traumatized people.

So what's the second thing that God's going to do?

He's going to show them how sick they are.

Guess what I do when people come to React and Finding Freedom?

Show you how screwed up you are and you'll all love me for it.

Another way to look at it, step one, if you're going to get healthy, you got to get to know God so you can trust him.

Step two, if you're going to get to healthy, you got to get to know yourself.

And so people are not going to change unless they know they're sick.

How many of you have either said this or talked to somebody and somebody has said to you or to somebody else, you should go to React and they go, I don't need React.

And everybody's looking at them going, what?

You don't know how badly you need React.

And they go, no, I don't need React.

And so how are they going to ever go to React?

When they see how sick they are.

So God is going to do the next event to help them see how sick they are.

Now, again, I want to say this up front.

This is not something we all get in line and clap for God that he's showing us how sick we are.

We like it when God shows us good things about ourself.

But when we get presented with an accurate picture that shows our ugliness, for most of us it takes us to shame or we just don't want to go there.

It's too painful, brings up too much stuff.

But what God is saying is, I'm not taking you there to leave you there as if pain all by itself was a good thing.

I'm taking you there because that has to be the place you begin if you're ever going to change.

So we're not going to stay there.

We're going to go there, get an accurate picture, and that's going to create a hunger and a motivation to change.

And so that's what God's going to do.

So let me read you what happened.

Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea.

So remember last week they went through the Red Sea and they moved out into the desert of Shur.

They traveled in the desert for three days without finding any water.

Now again, what you have to understand is a couple of things.

There were about three million people, but we're also told that they brought sheep, cattle, and goats.

So you can imagine that they brought water with them as they left Egypt.

They brought enough water to get them through a couple days.

But do you imagine how much water you would need to carry with you to feed a couple sheep and cows and your family?

A lot of water.

So they would run out very quickly.

So it says, when they came to the oasis of Merah.

So you can imagine three days they are thirsty, they are parched, and they see an oasis, they see palm trees and greenery, and they're going, water, we can't wait to get there.

And they all go running, but they found that the water was too bitter to drink.

So they called the place Merah, which means bitter.

So here's where you're going to get your first picture of complex trauma.

So they got their hopes up, we're going to have water, we're really thirsty, we're starting to get frustrated that there's been no water.

We found water and it's bitter.

What would a good complex trauma person do at that point?

Well, here's what they did.

They complained and they turned against Moses.

They blamed the leader for what was going on.

And what are we going to drink, they demanded?

So they are lashing out.

They are angry.

And you can imagine the noise, the drama, as all these frustrated people, are getting up from getting a drink of this bitter water, and they're mad, they're disappointed.

And so Moses cries out to the Lord for help, and the Lord showed him a piece of wood.

Now what's a complex trauma person going to do when Moses comes walking along with, here's the solution to our problem, and throws a piece of wood in the water?

You're going to get more mad at him.

But Moses threw it in the water, and this made peace.

The water, good to drink.

Sometimes the solutions we're looking for come from what seems like dumb, dumb things.

And it takes humility and trust to begin to trust some of that.

So it was there at Merah that the Lord set before them the following decree or law.

He said, If you will do what is right in God's sight, obeying His commands, keeping all His decrees, and following His commandments, you will be saved from the evil of the world.

And the Lord said to Moses, I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians, for I am the Lord that heals you.

And so Jehovah means I am the Lord that heals you.

It became a title for God.

So I want you to think about this event.

What was the purpose of this Merah event?

Those that don't have the sex over the type, and theها��anobookupgiving.com 1-足 developer Thank you.

And I'd like you to follow me on there so we can hopefully come out with lots ofи more great examples for you and Minnesota and the rest of the world.

I've been over to the 애 staircase after my sister in law waskannt on January 15th, in Tel Aviv.

Because it's she has the best and the best way of healing.

Because she crossed a river and she went with her husband to Medjin, very bottom in three days.

Three days early, here's the point I want you to get.

Not just does complex trauma cause you to have emotional roller coasters.

It does.

But three days earlier, if you were to interview the people coming out of slavery, here's what I think many would have said.

They would have said, you know why we have so much pain?

It's because of slavery.

Now that we're out of slavery, our life is going to be good.

We are going to be happy.

Our life is going to be wonderful because slavery was our problem.

How many of you have come out of addiction and said, addiction's my problem.

As soon as I get sober, all my problems are going to go away.

Everybody's going to love me.

My partner's going to love me.

All my problems are going to be fixed because drugs and alcohol are my problem.

That's all I got to deal with.

So what does God have to do with these people?

He knows slavery isn't your problem.

It's you that's your problem.

It's how slavery changed you.

So God knows that just because he took them out of Egypt doesn't mean that Egypt's out of them.

And so they have to see that.

And so how do you get a person who thinks that they're not going to get what they want?

How do you get a person who thinks that they're not going to get what they want?

How do you get a person who thinks they're healthy and that the external circumstances were the cause of their problems and they don't see their own unhealthiness?

How do you get them to see it?

You give them a bitter experience.

Do you want to know what happens in bitter experiences?

It exposes who we really are.

Do you want to know what happens when everything is smooth?

You can put on a mask and get away with it and you can be happy.

You can be happy.

You can be happy.

You can be happy.

You can be happy.

You can be maintain that for a while.

I don't know what's happening here.

My wife is playing with everything.

Are you on top of that there, hon?

Okay, there we go.

We'll have a talk later.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

Okay.

We'll just have a chat.

Okay.

Okay.

Do you remember what I was talking about?

Or did you just get the squirrel happening here?

Okay.

Back to what we're talking about.

It's easy to believe lies about what you're really like when life is easy.

You can think you're stronger than you are when life is easy.

You can think you're more loving than you are when life is easy because nothing is challenging that.

But when life is bitter and life is hard, it shows two different types of people.

Bitter experiences expose bitter hearts.

Bitter experiences in people who have their stuff healthy shows a healthy heart.

Bitter experiences shows the deep truth about ourself.

And so it's kind of interesting.

God wants to show them that they have a bitter heart.

So guess what he does?

He creates a bitter experience.

He creates a bitter experience.

And so it's kind of interesting.

God wants to show them that they have a bitter experience.

He creates a bitter experience.

And so it's kind of interesting.

And so it's kind of interesting.

God wants to show them that they have a bitter experience.

And so it's kind of interesting.

God wants to show them that they have a bitter experience.

And as they go through that, they begin to realize, wow, look at how we reacted when we didn't get water like we thought we were going to get.

We went negative.

We lashed out in anger.

We turned into these bitter people.

Maybe we got a problem.

Maybe we need a little bit of help.

And that is the purpose of this event is to put their truths into practice.

And that is the purpose of this event is to put their truths into practice.

nature on display so they could see it for themselves and that sadly is what most of us need so we can go through life thinking we're great and we can have an easy recovery but then every once in a while a really rough week hits us and you feel like you regress and you go maybe I've never learned anything no you just saw the broken places in a clear way because of that bitter event so here's what I want you to get God doesn't just want his people free from slavery he doesn't just want you free from addiction he wants healthy people he doesn't just want free people he wants free people who are healthy and that requires them finding out who they really are but let me take it further God knows that for you to be happy you don't just need freedom from addiction but you have to become healthy but there's a third thing that he wants he wants a relationship with them what did the bitter experience do it caused them to lash out at Moses and who did he direct them to God and and and and and and so what God is wanting if we're going to be happy is freedom from addiction become healthy have a relationship you need all three and that's what God is seeking to do so I heard at a young age when I was going through a very tough time in my life that this bitter experience can make me better or better and what happens in complex trauma it makes you bitter and now God says let's take all of this and turn it around in the right direction and turn it into making us better so let me just expand on that a little bit more you notice how he ended it he said I am the God who heals you now what had he just healed he had just healed the water why didn't God say I am the God that heals bitter water because the water was a metaphor of their heart and what he was saying is I healed the water and I healed the water and I healed the water but I want you to see that I want to heal you I want you to see your heart is just as bitter as this water and if I can heal the water I can heal you and he wanted them to know upfront that His commitment with them was not just to make them free but to make them healthy and that meant he wanted to heal them he wanted to put them through circumstances that felt terrible to the parents production processes circumstances where Jesus made Dennis live his life but but as soon as they saw the water they wanted to heal them because He wanted them dead and that was pain Fiat was going through circumstances that felt terrible terrible but would result in further healing.

And so when you hit rough patches today, you can get really mad and frustrated.

But look at it this way.

It's God saying, let's go to the next level of learning and healing.

This new experience is going to expose parts of you that are ugly and I'm exposing it so I can heal it.

I don't want this to become a bitter experience that leaves you bitter.

I want it to be a bitter experience that makes you better.

And that is the choice that we have.

So let me just comment on this stick.

I think there's two or three things that are important.

Number one, I already mentioned, sometimes the things that you need to get healthy seem stupid.

I don't know how many of you people have said to you, you should go and try this thing and go, ah, it's stupid.

And you're smarter than everybody, so you should know.

And what you have to realize is that sometimes the things that seem stupid, there's something in them that brings healing.

And we have to be open to that.

Second thing, I think the stick is also saying God was going to do his part, but he required Moses to do his part.

So that healing wasn't just a one-way thing where God said, sit on the operating table, I'll magically heal you, and you'll get up, and you'll be perfect.

No, God says, you got to do your part.

This isn't just me doing my part, you got to do your part.

But there's a third thing.

Do you realize that the problems of the Bible started with the tree in the Garden of Eden?

And then, in the New Testament, we are told that the solution to all of our problems is another tree, the one Jesus died on.

And I think, and many people think, that all of these stories here with Israel, each one tells us a little bit that says Jesus is coming.

He's the final solution.

And so the stick, the tree that Moses threw in, God is saying there's going to be another tree that's going to be the solution to a lot of your problems.

Final thing, the tree that Moses threw in, God is saying, there's going to be another tree that's going to be the solution to a lot of your problems.

And so, is this the simple thing I want to say?

And this isn't anything to do with the bitter water.

I want you to go back and think about Israel coming through the Red Sea.

Okay?

God was doing?

Shutting off any opportunity to return to the old life.

You know what many addicts would like?

God, open the sea to get me out of addiction!

But could you a tiny little path where I could get back if I need to.

Do you want to know recovery has to be at some point?

You purposely say, God, I'm closing all return routes.

I'm not going back.

Paraphernalia gone.

Drug dealer phone number's gone.

All of that gone.

Old friends, boundaries.

I find it interesting if you want to go to another thing.

God, the prophet Elijah was told to call the next prophet Elisha.

And Elisha was a farmer and he was plowing the field with oxen.

And God calls him through Elijah.

And guess what Elisha does?

He kills the oxen and uses the plow to create a fire to make a barbecue.

And he is saying, I am closing all return routes to my old life.

And so God, is saying to Israel, you're through out of slavery.

I'm closing the Red Sea, no return route.

Do you want to know what happened 11 months from now for them?

They got a committee together and said, let's return to slavery.

It's better than freedom.

And you go, how would anybody think that?

And I go, well, every addict I know has thought about that.

And?

And the thing that kept them going back was the Red Sea was closed.

And so the more return routes you can close, the better.
