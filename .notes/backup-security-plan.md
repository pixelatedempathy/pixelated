## 🔍 Validation Strategy

### Backup Integrity Testing

- [ ] Implement checksum verification for all backup files
- [ ] Conduct periodic restoration tests in sandbox environment
- [ ] Verify data integrity after restoration
- [ ] Test encryption/decryption process for all backup types

### Security Verification

- [ ] Audit access controls for backup storage
- [ ] Verify encryption implementation meets HIPAA standards
- [ ] Test key management procedures and rotation
- [ ] Validate secure transmission of backup data

## 🚦 Deployment Phases

### Phase 1: Initial Setup (Weeks 1-2)
