# Project Charter: Pixelated Empathy

## Vision Statement
To become the gold standard for emotionally intelligent AI systems that enhance human connection and improve mental health outcomes through scientifically-grounded empathy training and analysis.

## What We're Building
An enterprise-grade platform that combines:
- Advanced emotional intelligence analysis
- Professional training simulation environments
- Academic research dataset integration
- Real-time bias detection and mitigation
- Institutional deployment capabilities

## Why It Matters
Digital communication lacks the emotional nuance of face-to-face interaction. Healthcare professionals need tools to:
- Practice difficult conversations safely
- Understand emotional subtext in written communication
- Identify bias in their own responses
- Measure empathy improvement over time
- Scale training programs institutionally

## Core Requirements
### Functional Requirements
- ✅ Real-time emotional analysis of text conversations
- ✅ Journal dataset research pipeline (discovery → evaluation → acquisition → integration)
- ✅ Bias detection in professional communications
- ✅ Training simulation environment for mental health professionals
- ✅ Performance analytics and competency tracking
- ✅ Multi-platform deployment (web, mobile, API)
- ✅ HIPAA-compliant data handling

### Non-Functional Requirements
- 99.9% uptime for critical services
- <200ms response time for real-time analysis
- SOC2 Type II security compliance
- GDPR data protection standards
- Scalable to 100K+ concurrent users
- Zero-downtime deployment capability

## Success Criteria
### Quantitative Metrics
- 25% improvement in empathy scores among trained professionals
- 95% accuracy in emotional state classification
- <5% false positive rate in crisis detection
- 99.9% system availability
- Sub-200ms average response time

### Qualitative Goals
- Positive feedback from 90% of training participants
- Adoption by 50+ healthcare institutions
- Recognition as industry standard for empathy training
- Publication of research findings in peer-reviewed journals

## Stakeholders
### Primary
- Mental health professionals (end users)
- Healthcare administrators (institutional buyers)
- Training coordinators (program managers)

### Secondary
- Patients/consumers (beneficiaries)
- Researchers (academic partners)
- Investors (financial stakeholders)

## Constraints
- Must maintain HIPAA compliance
- Cannot store personally identifiable information
- Must support offline operation for training scenarios
- Need to accommodate various institutional IT environments
- Budget limitations for initial deployment

## Timeline
### Phase 1: Foundation (Completed)
- Core emotional analysis engine
- Basic training environment
- Journal research pipeline MVP

### Phase 2: Enhancement (Current)
- Advanced bias detection
- Expanded training scenarios
- Institutional deployment tools

### Phase 3: Scale (Future)
- Multi-language support
- Mobile applications
- Integration with existing healthcare systems

## Risks & Mitigation
### Technical Risks
- **AI bias in emotional analysis**: Regular auditing and bias correction protocols
- **Privacy breaches**: End-to-end encryption and regular security assessments
- **Performance degradation**: Continuous monitoring and auto-scaling

### Business Risks
- **Market adoption resistance**: Pilot programs with leading institutions
- **Regulatory compliance**: Dedicated compliance team and legal partnerships
- **Competition from established players**: Focus on specialized empathy training niche
