People from complex trauma, one of the things I hear them say to me very often is, I don't know who I am. So to begin, why don't people from complex trauma know who they are? And I want to give you four reasons why that is so. So if you think of a child coming into the world, they have all of these competing needs and drives inside of them. So one of the needs is, or drives is to be authentic, to be who they are. But they also have a need to be loved, to be accepted, to connect with other people. And so a child coming into the world, if it's in a healthy home, they're able to be authentic and they wait, will I be accepted? Will I be loved? And yes, they are accepted. Yes, they are loved. Yes, they connect. And so in their mind, being authentic is a good thing and I can just be me and I can be loved and connected for who I am. But bring that in complex trauma. The child comes into an unhealthy situation and they decide to be authentic, but that doesn't work so well for them. No one wants to connect with them. They're punished or laughed at or teased or criticized for parts of who they are when they're authentic. And so what they quickly realize is if I want to be loved, if I want to connect with people, I have to hide who I am. I can't be authentic. And so I have to learn how to wear masks. I have to learn how to sense what other people want from me and become what they want, be a chameleon. I have to adopt different roles and situations so that people will like me, respect me, and want to be my friend. And so very early on, they have this core belief that develops, I can't be who I am. I have to be somebody else. So that leads to not knowing who they really are because the early understanding of who they are, the earlier they learn, the more they in life you had to wear masks and not be authentic and adopt roles, the greater chance that you don't know who you are because you've always worn masks, always played roles. So that's the first reason. The second characteristic of children coming into life is just a natural curiosity. So they come into life and they explore, they try new things, sports, hobbies, painting, music, and they spend time just dreaming about what they want to be. And so they're not just going to be a chameleon. So they're not just going to be a chameleon. They're going to be a chameleon. They're going to be a And if you're in a safe world, you can do that. And when you're in safety, your cortex works at its maximum, and it allows you to be curious and to explore. And all of that leads to a child figuring out what they're good at, figuring out who they are, figuring out their personality. But bring in complex trauma. When you're in survival mode, the cortex isn't working very well and you can't be concerned about being curious about life and exploring you're all about what do I have to do to survive you're you're in fight flight you're not in curiosity mode and so you can't figure out who you are you're just trying to survive and then beyond that part of what makes life unsafe for some children is that they grow up in families of abuse where they are just made servants or slaves by their parents and it's just work work work they don't have time to go and play sports or do things with friends and other hobbies and so it's just they're working serving and they don't get a chance to figure out who they are or some have a father who's a dictator and he tells them how to think how to feel he tells them what jobs they should take each of them he allows only certain activities and forbids other types of hobbies he might even tell them what university courses and career they should pursue he regulates and controls their life they don't have the chance to figure out who they are and then some parents they want their child to fulfill their dream for the child they want their child to be a doctor or an NHL player they don't let the child explore what they're good at okay you know and just be hear what Philip BuddenAC said you're good at you're not good at and Bruce Miskin 개�lo one of the bad things about the adult brain is that rajlu mentioned that the emotionalldor fuck the baby uncle better is afraid of death the child brings him at home old age pushing their will to save 175 00.'19?. Gosh I will throw you an old thin... one false in the Approach Who does it one of the problems, Gov. what their personality is the child is forced to carry out the parents dreams for them and they don't get a chance to figure out who they are or what they want to do with their life and then another aspect of a child living in an environment where they're safe is they get to connect with themselves they get to explore their internal world not just the external world and so they can think about their emotional world they can explore their thoughts and what they feel about different things they can dream they can plan and they can get to know their impulses and their emotions and their thought were all their internal world they can explore that and then they can explore what is that I want to do with my life what's my purpose what do I have a passion for all of that happens in a safe environment in a healthy family but what happens in a healthy environment in a healthy family what happens in a healthy family is that you're not just trying to survive you're trying to overcome your complex trauma you're surviving you don't want to explore your internal world because your internal world is made up of painful emotions that you can't resolve you therefore need to disconnect from your internal world and so you disconnect from your emotions you disconnect from a lot of your thinking you disconnect from your passions and sense of purpose you're just trying to survive and not feel and so you don't connect to your external world or to your internal world you don't have time to explore dreams all of that stuff there's one other aspect of what happens to a child in a healthy world when they're authentic versus a child in complex trauma in a healthy world if you're allowed to be authentic and your parents provide a loving environment safe environment if your parents are living fairly healthy life and role modeling healthy wrong hace and standards and rule modeling healthy behaviors you're in a world where you're learning about hard work and honesty and reliability and respect but what happens if you're a child in complex trauma where it's very unsafe and you don't have good role models well you have to lie to survive you you can't be always reliable because some days you're you're running you have out I'm used to doing self love but because I look to all these other people who we met, and last few days in around 40 states, she disappointed me just at this point, it may be 아직  leer kaum aan bo khoot.
