How do you explain to your children what is happening there? How do you take the fear from your children, from whom you say they go out on the street, they hear Arabic next to each other and they hang out together? They live a life that is more permanent, spending half a night, whole nights somewhere in a bunker. How do you give them something like confidence and optimism, which you need to somehow continue living? You know, the truth is, I am so close to the Geisel families and the children of the Geisel families, and also the many children who were abducted at three, five, eight years old and were released after months, that I always think about what kind of luxury they live in with my children. About the rockets, they know what they have to do, we run into the bunker. It's bad at night when I have to wake them up and then I'm alone with them. Because my husband is in the reserve and the children could hardly fall asleep out of fear that they don't know if they will see their father again. Then they finally sleep and then the siren wakes them up or I do and I have to tear them down to get to the bunker in time with dog and hare. But still I think to myself, my God, they are not raised in the south. You said you tell your children, these are the good rockets. What are good rockets in contrast to bad rockets? The good rockets are the Iron Dome, because even in the bunker, even underground, the explosions are sometimes so loud and so bad, especially during the attack from Iran, when there were thousands of tons of ballistic rocket launchers, that there were many moments of fear of death, where my children asked me if I would die and where I had no answer. But I can only tell you, we have a strong army and it protects us and we have the good rockets, the Iron Dome. And what you are hearing now is the destruction of the good rocket, of the evil rocket from Iran, from Yemen, from the Gaza Strip, from Lebanon. It is unfortunately not missing on the fronts. But again and again I think of these children from the south who experienced the 7th of October, who sometimes saw in front of their eyes how their mother was first raped and then slaughtered, who themselves were exposed to the violence and who were torn apart by the Hamas, by their parents, who were alone in some terrorist hands in the Gaza Strip, like the children of the Biba, these two beautiful young people, Jinji, the 9-month-old Ariel and his brother Kfir, who were later brutally murdered by the Hamas in the Gaza Strip and who are still a symbol for all children. You know, my son is Jinji. And there is no time when he doesn't appear at the airport, on the poster of the Kfir, when he passes by the small Kfir and sits down on the floor and cries because he feels so brotherly with him and because he knows at the age of nine that this baby is no longer alive because the Hamas killed him. Simply because he is a Jewish child in his own state. But again, and these children in the south, what they have experienced, what the kidnapped children have experienced, who are slowly coming back to life today, but sometimes still do not have their father back, because he is still in the Gaza Strip. And that they were there before, because they had no life for 15 years, as normal children before October 7, because the Hamas, from the moment when it received the Gaza Strip as a gift from Israel in 2005, and carried out this coup against the Fatah, started to make a terror hub out of this Gaza Strip instead of making a small oasis in Singapore and started to shoot rockets to the south. And these children, and you will understand this as a psychologist, do not have a normal life, no normal psychological development, because they do not even go to the toilet from a young age without knowing whether they are going to the bunker on time, because they only have 7 seconds or 15 seconds and not like us in Tel Aviv, one minute to get to safety. And let me just conclude on this point. I think it is remarkable what you do for an important job with the children. There is no child in the world that can experience such a situation. And every child who can be helped has to be helped. And I dream, I wish for the day when little Maria from Gaza with little Jahel from Bairi, who was kidnapped at the age of 3, but today lives and even got her dad back a few months ago, that they can talk to each other at some point and that they experience a better and more pain-free future. But all of this only works if we manage to get extremists, the Hamas, to drive out the terrorists from this region. And that is what I want to say. I think after two years of discussing this topic, we have already started to discuss it here, I think it's time to think about the next step. Don't you think that the Israeli army, that the state in which you live, in which you belong, in which you defend, is responsible for what happens to these children, what happens, what we have just heard about? I'm not trying to mix up the emotional and the geopolitical dimension here unnecessarily. You have just picked up Groos and all sorts of things in there. But I'm not really asking you... Do you see this with the chasm? I don't see it at all with the chasm, on the contrary. You started with Iran and Fatah and the history of the Hamas. I'm really interested in Genoese and I speak to Israelis every day. Every day. I work with Israelis. I'm asking myself if you can show this reflection, if you can show them that, that you immediately limit yourself to the suffering of the Israelis, to the suffering, to the geopolitical situation, to the hopelessness of the situation in your country, in which you are, in your opinion, immediately, or if you can really deal with the situation in Gaza Strip and ask yourself who is responsible for what is happening there. The 100,000 displaced, the 10,000 dead, the estimated 18,000, the estimated 18,000 children. It must be the moment of reflection at some point. And I know that it has been used by many Israelis for a long time. But also with you, not just to say that it is tragic what is happening there and every child has to be helped, but to stop doing what is being done there every day. I mean, I don't mean that as a provocation, but as a genuinely genuine attempt to get to you, because I wonder if I raise a curtain. I want to answer you very, very openly. For God's sake, Mr. Gerlach, you are just suggesting to me that I answer the question of Mr. Landst, who is asking me how I explain this situation to my children and how the children in Israel deal with the trauma of October 7. And you suggest to me what I think, after I hear this, to answer this question. Then I ask you how... No, I don't want to answer that. No, no, no. I want to ask you how you can be so determined to seek humanity and hope nowhere, but to remain with this obsession of bashing and in the end, until you are not given the pill, that Israel is the aggressor and that Israel is the greater danger in the world than Iran, you are not satisfied. But I'll tell you one thing and I'll tell you very clearly. You are talking about responsibility. We take responsibility very seriously. I take it personally very seriously. I'm sorry for every single Palestinian child who no longer lives today. The responsibility, Mr. Gerlach, is carried by one and one alone. And that is the Hamas. Because we have stopped sacrificing our own children so that other children don't die. We don't want them to die. And the IDF does more than any army in the world to ensure that civilians are evacuated, that they come safely and thus also over the... the surprise effect of the Hamas we are going to renounce. So pay military price for it. Our own soldiers are dying, are dying for the civilians to be able to be saved before. That 12 to 18 now in Khan Younes field hospitals are being built for the first time, in which the little Maria and others can be treated, if before that 85% of the actual medical facilities in the Gaza Strip from the Hamas were abused as a terrorist infrastructure. If only a few days ago the Hamas dared to shoot UN aid convoys to steal the truckloads and thus block the roads that should be built by the UN to allow further aid deliveries. And because it's so nice after they have fired and the load trucks as blockades then steal 2700 units of baby food. So that too is depriving the people, the civilians. Ask for responsibility. Yes, the responsibility lies with the Hamas. Not a single soldier in the Gaza Strip. Not my husband, not my two nephews and not all the soldiers I know and who we fear every day that we will never see them again. Not a single one has fun there. Believe me, they prefer to be with their families and live their lives on. But as long as our children are not safe and we do not know that our children will never be taken out of their beds again and in some terror torture carcasses by the Hamas. Israel cannot afford as a sovereign and democratic state to end this war in the middle and to let the Hamas continue to act and to plan for the next 7th of October. I have a lot of questions and I think many here in the round I would like to ask Elmar at the end because we will lose Elmar in a moment. Elmar, again, the two-state solution that is being put into the room by many Western politicians. And from which Melanie Suharebisch says that this is such a strange obsession, if I understood that correctly. You can forget that. It will not work. No, I didn't say that. Did I misinterpret it? Or at least not now. No, not now. I read interviews from you where you basically say there is such a strange obsession. That's completely crazy. In the current situation after the 7th of October, where our spirits are still there, yes, isn't this the moment to start over two states? That is exactly the argumentation and the line of someone like Netanyahu. But I think that's the way it is. Is that what was discussed in Washington, Elmar? Is that from the table or is that still a serious option? So I listened very intensely earlier because I have been to Israel several times and I know very, very well the wounds and the scars that this confrontation has had over years or even decades. I think this is actually the decisive point. If you don't address them, how can you then talk about a goal of a second state and a peaceful coexistence? I think it is important to do this, that you come to this point, a peaceful coexistence with two states. That is my very personal opinion. But you can only get there if you talk about all these emotions, about these scars and wounds. And it's not enough, again my personal opinion, but also as a observer, as a reporter, that you can talk about 20 very good things on a piece of paper and then actually expect that this will just happen. And it doesn't happen like that if all these points are not addressed, the emotions that play a role, if no mechanisms are provided, how you can talk about justice, which authorities are responsible and so on. And again, I think the paper in the matter is actually very good and very correct, but it contains zero evidence that the people of Israel are in fact in the middle of the whole work that has to be done to get to this point of peaceful coexistence. And that is the decisive question for me as a reporter. We couldn't ask you yesterday, because neither Netanyahu nor Trump allowed questions at the end of this press conference. And I think these are questions that have to be answered. Otherwise the paper is not worth much if the work that is needed is not done to bring it into reality. I would like to thank you for coming to San Francisco and for your willingness to participate in this broadcast. You are currently working on a report, so it's not that easy to organize it. But it worked, thank you very much. I would like to ask Daniel Gerlach, before we want to understand what is actually happening in Gaza. Political questions, two-state solution, is that something we have to say, we always flee back and forth to the question of the situation and I hear these accusations that almost sound like car suggestions also from German politicians who say, no, we really have to push this forward. And then I hear your position, I hear the position of Netanyahu, I also hear Palestinians who say in the way in West Jordan in particular facts are being created where you are talking about a territory that now looks like a Swiss cheese with a corresponding state area, not much to do, make it up. I think the fact that facts are being created and that this Israeli government really tries to make the two-state solution impossible, also has to do with the fact that it is under enormous pressure. The international support or the international look away on the issue of occupation, that's finally, and I think the Israeli government also fears in America, that the wind could turn. That means, you try to create facts as quickly as possible in this situation. You mean that the international pressure is getting so big? The international pressure or the willingness to support it or, it's not about criticizing it, but just letting it happen, that it takes it away. And that's why the government is trying to push the tube here. She tries to make invitations as quickly as possible, for new settlement projects, that make sure that you don't have any more connections between north and south. She tries to make the Palestinian cities so that there is no connection to the territory. The Palestinian Autonomy Authority of Netanyahu also said that it would not change and that it would not play a role in the Gaza Strip. Of course, there is also a lot of money and tax money. And the whole issue, which she has already left with Trump, even if she keeps all options open, is that she is also leading a struggle for relief. She realizes that the international pressure has become so strong that it can reach a critical mass. And I have to do something now and that it takes it away. And Gaza and the brutal and reckless behavior of the fighting forces, even if Ms. Sukharevich doesn't see it that way, is documented and relatively undoubted and is taken into account by a large part of the world public, and that is the point. About the two-state solution one can be of different opinions. About what happens in Gaza, that it has to stop and that it is despicable, one cannot be of two opinions, unless one pursues it with a certain political interest. And there we are in a situation where of course the war in Gaza and the two-state solution are connected, but that is of course not the same. The Saudi-French plan is a very interesting one, it is a very interesting one and it is a very interesting one and it is a very interesting one because the American government has done everything in the last few months to make this plan despicable and ridiculous. He said at some point that the French should build a Palestinian state in the Côte d'Azur. The American position and the Foreign Minister have very much opposed the two-state solution. And the American position has a growing number of votes that say we have to create a Palestinian self-determination because otherwise this conflict situation will repeat itself and people can dream of peace even if one side does not have a self-determination. And that is the decisive or one of the many problems with this plan. The counterpart on the Palestinian side who is supposed to implement all the visions that are being laid out, has again an asymmetry. He has made a plan, talks about Abraham Accords, international normalization, etc. without having a partner on the Palestinian side and without recognizing a Palestinian partner. And I think that is a very important point because you have to disarm Gaza, the management of Gaza, the future of Gaza, the security of Gaza with such a project. For Netanyahu and for the government and for many Israelis these are two different things. And then there is the question whether there should be a joint Palestinian state. And on the Israeli side one has to wait for the one who says we want to revive this idea, we want to create security, we want to give the idea a chance and we do not believe that a crew and nothing else is what happens there will solve the situation. I heard Smodric, the finance minister, one of the two ministers I quoted, who quoted an eloquent diplomatic failure, just a few minutes ago said that there is a huge issue unless we change our old words against the situation and when it happens and it becomes a cuando it becomesор traffic and抛 regret If he ever needed it, just from the voter's vote out, so from the Knesset, he had the full support of the entire opposition, from Benny Gantz to Yair Lapid. What worries me a lot is that we are trying to ignore the huge elephant in the room. Have you ever asked Palestinians how they imagine it with their own Palestinian state? And I mean specifically those 80% of Palestinians, both in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, who celebrated and said after October 7th what Hamas did was right and good. And then I ask myself, completely apart from wishing the Palestinians their own state, I ask myself, completely apart from wishing the Palestinians their own state, firstly because I am a humanist and I want to see freedom in my neighborhood and the same opportunities that we have in Israel, and secondly because I want security for my own children. But if they are not willing to recognize a Jewish state on their side, and that is a question mark, I wish that these statistics that come from Palestinians themselves are no longer relevant and that they have de-radicalized from one day to the next and are suddenly willing to say, I don't want to be a part of the Palestinian state, I want to be a part of the Jewish state. I hope so, but as long as the situation is like this, we still have Hamas there. And that's why the Geisel families today, the mothers with whom I was with the Chancellor in the morning, thanked him for not having participated in this farce and recognizing a Palestinian state, while their children are still in the clutches of Hamas. Because that's what we call the Hamas. Because that's what we call the Hamas. ...because that's nothing more than a fight for these mothers, namely a price for Hamas. May I ask you once, with a term like proportionality, collective punishment of a whole people, can you do anything with that? No. Nothing. No. If we would talk about proportionality after October 7, I would ask you, what is this? to let go of a mass of mob and to rape and murder civilians. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Look, it's, it's, it's, it's terrible. It's a category that I didn't invent, but it's a legal category. It's a category of proportionality. How many dead people are appropriate then, to put it in a very cynical way? There's no answer to such a question, for God's sake. And if I ask you whether it is proportionally that two thirds of teachers who die there are women and children. Do you say because you believe in the Hamas statistics and because you take them as face value? The Israeli army takes over these numbers itself. Your former general staff member recently spoke specifically about these numbers in a meeting. Which you also followed in Hebrew. Excuse me, but that's pretty cheap now. What you're doing here is you're putting scientific, from Israeli, from the Israeli intelligence services and military, recognized figures. So in question they wipe them off the table. That's half a year ago. No, I'm not taking that. Half a year ago they told me, yes, yes, that would be such a thing with the numbers, but half of them would have been Hamas fighters. This, that is, that is invented, that is propaganda, that is a lie. And that, that, that is what the Israeli rioters themselves know. And they don't claim that anymore. And what the IDF rioters know, they know better than you. No, no, no, no, no. You can discuss the discussion. Let us exactly, please, let us please. You have addressed two very important aspects. And it's up to you whether you want an answer from me or not. I would very much like to. I would like to. But this very game, so to speak, propaganda and propaganda, that's exactly what we shouldn't play, I think. In the sense of doubting numbers, constantly making accusations of guilt. I mean, please look at this picture back there. We are actually talking about it. That this is a kind of destruction. And also brutality. Which you, when you say I am a humanist, which I immediately take away from you, then you have to do something about it. And didn't you see my statements in the last few minutes how much I suffer with the poor Palestinian children who are in this terrible situation because of Hamas? But do you still have to keep going like this? No, no, you don't want to stop with that. That's my question. No, no, you don't want to stop with that. You don't want to stop, Mr. Lanz. You want this war to end. But it can only end when Hamas lays down their weapons and we know that there can be no 7th of October and when it frees our geysers. Then this war ends. Okay. I would like to answer Katrin once and please explain once. You have been in many crises and war zones in this world. I quoted you earlier, you said, never have I seen anything like that in Gaza. What did you expect? What did you expect when you went there and what did you actually plan? But first your introduction to what you just heard. I mean, as a child psychologist, as a humanist, as a helper, as a mother, my heart bleeds for all the children who are suffering. Also your children, Ms. Sukharevich, and also the Israeli children who have partly become a geyser or have been taken. And of course they are worried about their fathers. But you said you can tell your children that these are the good rockets. There are no good rockets in Gaza. All of them are deadly. And it's not true that you are warned as a civilizist. I personally lived in the so-called humanitarian zone and, as I said, only a few hundred meters away the rockets fell. Without warning. Without warning. So it's not true that you can somehow save yourself if you just want to save yourself or if you run fast enough. No, of course not. We built the tunnels for ourselves and not for the civilians. Yes, but the civilians, if you lie in a tent and put your child to sleep and a rocket strikes, without warning, you can't go anywhere. That's how everyday life is in Gaza. Oopsie. Can I ask you one more time? Because you say everyday life in Gaza. One indication of these days is to withdraw to the south, to this very small protection zone. Get out of Gaza city. Where I myself was a few years ago and had already seen what kind of conditions they were. And always had the feeling that it would end badly because you can't build something that has a future and that is in some form of a disaster. And that I think that's what ends in some form of optimism. Can people actually get away from Gaza city? Is it actually purely logistically possible to say I'm going from Gaza city somewhere in the south where I'm somehow safer? Yes and no. Do you have enough money? Can you? So it costs now to be transported from Gaza city to the south, mainly by donkey carts. It costs about 2000 euros. 2000 euros? 2000 euros. For the transport by donkey cart? Yes. Of course you can walk, but then you don't get anything with you. You don't get mattresses, no cooktops, no clothes. Nothing that has the so-called new beginning in the south. That means many, I also get desperate messages from colleagues, from friends who just say, you can and you can't. Yes. But there are also people who say that they have to get off the road in order to get out of the way, because then you and your friends somehow support us so that we can get out of here at all. Some people are so sick, if you have lost both legs and no wheelchair and no one can carry you, then you won't get away. Doctors Without Borders now has to close the activities or our clinic in the Gaza city, as you said. Yes. And that's a decision that's so, so difficult. Because that means the patients who can move somehow, they get a little bandage, they may get a little pain. But that means children with open wounds, that is, with amputated legs, they then suddenly sleep on the street. That means you get your leg amputated and then stay the night on the street? Yes. Infection risk? Huge, huge. And many, many of us also die from these infections. We have far too few antibiotics because not enough is left in. And if you can't move, that means children who are in an acupuncture or people on the intensive care unit or people who are so injured that they can't get out of the hospital, we just have to leave them. That's a decision for people. My God. And I have colleagues who are trained to save people's lives. That's so difficult. And is there hunger in Gaza? Yes. I can tell you about little Kefaya, four years old. She came to us in a wet hospital because she had an injury. But that was ... I've never seen such a terrified, tense child. She didn't leave her mother for a second. Well, many children can cling to their mothers. But that was the extreme version now. The mother couldn't go to the toilet without Kefaya having to hold her. She could ... I wasn't allowed to get close to her because she was afraid, yes, above all, actually. And the reason was that Kefaya's little sister was hungry. She somehow had the feeling that my mother was hungry. Yes. I had the feeling that my mother could protect me from the rockets because we could just flee. Or ... that's possible somehow. But if my own little sister is starving, then I'm in danger of life too. And we see pictures. It's really true. My colleagues, some of them, when they send pictures, I hardly recognize them again. Your own colleagues. My own colleagues. Because the doctors don't have enough calories for themselves anymore. Yes. And they are now so thin that I hardly recognize them again. And when you're injured, you actually need extra calories. A person who has a fire accident needs about 3000 calories a day to heal. I have colleagues who have tried to bring baby food in their own suitcases to Gaza because they work there. And it was taken away from them at the border. With what reason? We never get that. And when we are stopped, when things are taken away from us, it is ... or we are ... Yes. Or we are not allowed in. We never get the reasons. I think that the most moving part of your recordings, which is a diary that you wrote there, and I can imagine that it is necessary to write a diary there to somehow process and get rid of what you experience there, is the part in which you tell that on the one hand there are these completely frightened, screaming children, these dreadful screams that penetrate the nights and keep people awake, and on the other hand there are these completely frightened, screaming children, these dreadful screams that penetrate the nights and keep people awake, but on the other hand there are these children who withdraw completely, who sleep 20 hours a day, who don't say a word, who don't let anyone come near them and who also refuse to eat. And you say and write that in this book too, these are the children who worry the most about me. Why? Because they totally step back from life. It's not a choice. It's just a reaction to what they just experienced. They experienced that it was so bad that the body tries, the soul tries to protect this child. Adam, who is five years old, is one of these children. You also describe him in this book as a crazy story. Yes. He... It was special because... That's the boy we're seeing here right now, right? That's the boy. That's after he, thank God, got better. When I met him, he was only in his room. We weren't even allowed to open the door to his room because he didn't want to know anything about the world. He didn't talk, he hardly ate, he was very, very sick. He also had... He was witness to how his father died. They were both victims of a rocket impact and were taken to the hospital, laid on the floor because there was no other place. And Adam then sees how his father dies on the floor. Next to him. Next to him. Next to him. He loses a foot himself, but survives. But because he hardly ate, he floats in danger for a long, long time. The problem is a bit like Maria. His whole development stops. He doesn't learn... It also happens physiologically, that's how you describe it. You say the prefrontal cortex, where everything happens in our head, that also really biologically stops to exist. The brain that rubs children doesn't keep rusting. Exactly. What does that mean? That means that they will have problems for life. That means all that we actually need for everyday life to get through to some extent. Planning, which task do I do first and which do I do last. Making risk assessments. Say, yes, now it's your turn and I'm waiting, even though I want to go first. To resist impulses. All that we actually need for everyday life, that's developing too slowly. And the best example of how long that can last is actually from my own brother. He was adopted from Vietnam in 1974. A war child, like the children in Gaza. Woke up with bombs, very little food. And as a child I just found him funny. I understood myself somehow. Why he reacted like that. Why he was lying under the table on New Year's Eve and was trembling. Or why we hid bread slices behind books for years after he came to us. Although he was safe, he didn't feel safe. That's what follows the children for years. But now, 50 years later, although he has achieved a lot, he has a job, he has a family. But this, what I now cognitively understand, he has war damage. He never really, or his brain never really caught up. Yes, this practical thinking, logical thinking, understanding complicated relationships, doing a longer education. And that now concerns a whole generation. So a million children in Gaza are traumatized. Some stronger, some less. But under the influence of war, there is a lot of trauma. But to live under such extreme stress and to be afraid of dying every day.
