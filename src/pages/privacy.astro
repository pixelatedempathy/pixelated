      <p>
        At Pixelated Empathy, the privacy and security of your information is
        our highest priority. We've engineered our systems from the ground up
        with privacy-by-design principles and cutting-edge encryption
        technology. This Privacy Policy details how we collect, use, protect,
        and handle your personal information and protected health information
        (PHI) when you use our services.
      </p>

        HIPAA Compliance Commitment
      </h2>
      <p>
        Pixelated Empathy is fully committed to compliance with the Health
        Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) and all related
        regulations. As a healthcare technology provider, we implement all
        required administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to protect
        the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of PHI.
      </p>
      <p>
        For healthcare providers using our platform, we execute Business
        Associate Agreements (BAAs) that clearly outline our respective
        responsibilities regarding the protection of PHI. Our entire platform is
        subjected to regular third-party HIPAA compliance audits to ensure we
        meet or exceed all statutory requirements.
      </p>

        Information We Collect
      </h2>
      <p>We collect information that you provide directly to us, including:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
        <li>Account information (name, email, professional credentials)</li>
        <li>Authentication credentials (securely stored)</li>
        <li>Therapy session content and communications</li>
        <li>Billing and payment information</li>
        <li>Usage data and platform analytics</li>
        <li>Technical information about your devices and connection</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For healthcare providers, we may collect protected health information
        (PHI) about your clients. This information is always encrypted using our
        advanced security measures described below.
      </p>

      <h2

        style="color: #4a9a95 !important;"

        Advanced Security Architecture
      </h2>
      <p>Our platform implements multiple layers of security and encryption:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
        <li>
          <strong>Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE):</strong> The cornerstone of
          our security architecture, FHE allows our AI systems to analyze and process
          your data while it remains fully encrypted. This means your sensitive information
          is never exposed in an unencrypted form, even during processing.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Client-Side Encryption:</strong> All data is encrypted on your
          device before transmission to our servers, ensuring data is protected from
          the moment it leaves your device.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>End-to-End Encryption:</strong> Communications between users are
          encrypted end-to-end, meaning only the intended recipients can decrypt
          and view the content.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HIPAA-Compliant Data Storage:</strong> All stored data uses AES-256-GCM
          encryption with secure key management and regular key rotation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Zero-Knowledge Architecture:</strong> Our systems are designed
          so that we technically cannot access your unencrypted data, even if compelled
          to do so.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2
        class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4"
        style="color: #4a9a95 !important;"
      >
        How We Use Your Information
      </h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
        <li>Provide, maintain, and improve our services</li>
        <li>Process transactions and send related information</li>
        <li>Authenticate users and protect against unauthorized access</li>
        <li>Generate anonymized, aggregated analytics about service usage</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations, including HIPAA requirements</li>
        <li>Detect and prevent security incidents and fraudulent activity</li>
        <li>
          Send technical notices, updates, security alerts, and administrative
          messages
        </li>
        <li>Respond to your comments, questions, and requests</li>
        <li>
          Develop new products and services that may be of interest to you
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2
        class="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4"
        style="color: #4a9a95 !important;"
      >
        Information Sharing and Disclosure
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to our zero-knowledge encryption architecture, we technically cannot
        access your data in a decrypted form. We do not sell, trade, or
        otherwise transfer your personally identifiable information or PHI to
        outside parties except in the following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-5 my-4">
        <li>
          <strong>With Your Explicit Consent:</strong> We will share your information
          with third parties only when you have authorized us to do so.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted
          third parties who assist us in operating our website, conducting our business,
          or providing services to you, as long as these parties agree to keep this
          information confidential and secure. All such parties sign BAAs when they
          may encounter PHI.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information when required
          by law, such as in response to a subpoena, court order, or other legal
          process. However, due to our encryption architecture, we may only be able
          to provide encrypted data that cannot be decrypted without your keys.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If Pixelated Empathy is involved in
          a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or a portion of its assets, you will
          be notified via email and/or prominent notice on our website of any change
          in ownership or uses of your information, as well as any choices you may
          have regarding your information.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Data Retention and Deletion
      </h2>
      <p>
        We retain your information for as long as necessary to provide our
        services and fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy,
        unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. For
        PHI, we follow HIPAA-mandated retention periods.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you delete your account, we initiate a secure deletion process that
        permanently removes your personal data from our systems within 30 days.
        Due to our encryption architecture, deleted data cannot be recovered
        once this process is complete.
      </p>
