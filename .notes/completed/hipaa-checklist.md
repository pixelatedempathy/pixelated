> providing advanced security for data at rest, in use, and in transit. FHE enables computation
> on encrypted data without decryption, exceeding HIPAA requirements for traditional AES-256 and
> client-side encryption. All PHI and sensitive data benefit from field-level FHE protection, and
> robust key management and rotation policies are enforced.

#### Data Security

- [x] **PHI Handling**
  - ✅ Create automated PHI detection system
  - ✅ Implement intelligent redaction capabilities
  - ✅ Set up data loss prevention controls

> **Note:**
> Pixelated Empathy has implemented a centralized PHI/PII detection and redaction system that combines
> regex-based pattern matching with a framework for future NLP-based enhancements. All text processing
> utilities in the platform now use this system to identify and redact sensitive information. The
> implementation includes comprehensive test coverage and is integrated into the privacy utilities.
> Future enhancements will add NLP/NER capabilities for context-aware detection of more complex PHI
> patterns.
>
> A comprehensive Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service has been implemented to prevent unauthorized transmission
> of PHI/PII. The DLP system integrates with the PHI detection engine to scan outgoing content, apply
> appropriate policy actions (allow, redact, block), generate security alerts for suspicious activity, and
> maintain a detailed audit trail. The system includes configurable rules with customizable actions and
> thresholds, providing a flexible framework for PHI/PII protection at all data exit points.
>
> The DLP system has been fully integrated with a comprehensive admin interface that allows authorized
> personnel to manage DLP rules, monitor DLP activity, and respond to potential data leaks. The DLP Rules
> Manager provides a user-friendly interface for creating, editing, and managing DLP policies across
> the platform. The admin layout for the DLP system has been enhanced with:
>
> - Consistent navigation and improved accessibility
> - Integrated audit logging for all DLP management actions

> security-related admin interfaces while improving performance through Astro's hybrid rendering approach.
> The interface includes comprehensive configuration options, backup status monitoring, recovery testing
> functionality, and reporting capabilities.
>
> Pixelated Empathy has implemented a comprehensive backup security system that exceeds HIPAA requirements for
> data protection and disaster recovery. The system features:
>
> - **End-to-end encryption** using AES-256-GCM for all backup data, with robust key management and rotation policies.
> - **Secure, versioned backup strategy** with configurable retention policies for different backup types (full,
>   differential, and transaction-level backups) and automatic enforcement of retention periods.
> - **Multi-location storage support** with automatic replication to secondary and tertiary storage providers to
>   ensure data availability in case of provider outages.
> - **Comprehensive integrity verification** with SHA-256 hash verification of all backup content to detect
>   any tampering or corruption.
> - **Data Loss Prevention (DLP) integration** to scan and redact any unauthorized sensitive data before backup.
> - **Fully automated recovery testing** with customizable test cases, isolated test environments, and detailed
>   reporting of test results.
> - **Complete audit logging** of all backup creation, verification, and restoration activities.
>
> The automated recovery testing system regularly verifies that backups can be successfully restored in
> isolated environments. The testing framework includes customizable test cases for different backup types
> and verification methods including hash comparison, database query validation, and API functionality checks.
> Test results are automatically logged and reported, with notifications for failed tests.
>
> The system is accessible through a comprehensive set of REST APIs that enable secure, programmatic access
> to backup management and recovery testing functionality. These APIs are protected with role-based access
> controls to ensure only authorized administrators can perform sensitive operations.
