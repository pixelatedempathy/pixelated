# 🌌 Pixelated Empathy: The Psychology Engine

## *Digitizing the Practice of Human Connection*

---

## 🎭 The Vision: Frequency over Content

We are shifting from a **Data Pipeline** (collecting what people say) to an **Emotional Intelligence Engine** (optimizing how they say it). We don't just build chatbots; we build the **Standard for Therapeutic Interaction**.

> "Beyond the screen lies a deeper connection. We are building the bridge."

## 🚀 The Product Hierarchy

### 1. The Core Engine (`PX-Core`)

The "Brain". A 7B-parameter model optimized not for general chat, but for **Therapeutic Alliance** and **Validated Empathy**.

### 2. The Supervisor (`PX-Oversight`)

A separate, high-fidelity model that acts as a real-time clinical supervisor. It critiques the therapist (human or AI), flags bias, and suggests pivots.

### 3. The Empathy Gym™ (`PX-Simulator`)

The high-fidelity training environment where theory meets practice.

## 🌲 Branching Ideas & Future Horizons

* **Family Constellation Simulation**: Multi-agent environments to simulate group therapy sessions.
* **Non-Verbal Cartography**: Integrating tremors in voice/facial micro-expressions into the text latent space.
* **The "Shadow" Model**: An AI that purposefully acts as a "Difficult Patient" to stress-test human therapists.

## 📊 Strategic Pillars

### 🛡️ Safety as a Moat

Our `EarsComplianceGate` isn't just a utility; it's a regulatory shield. By open-sourcing parts of it, we become the standard.

### 🧠 Steerability (Control Vectors)

We don't swap models. We slide moods. Our "Mood Slider" technology (Representation Engineering) is 100x faster and more fluid than traditional adapters.
