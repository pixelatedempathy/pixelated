### Notes

- **ALWAYS** make sure your Python environment is activated before running any commands.
- uv (.venv) is where our python environment lives. Run 'source .venv/bin/activate' to activate it.
- **ALWAYS** make sure you are in the root directory of the project before running any commands.
- Unit tests should be placed alongside the code files they are testing
- Use `uv pytest ai/pixel/` to run all Pixel-related tests
- Training infrastructure requires 8x A100 GPUs minimum for full-scale training
- Psychology knowledge extraction leverages existing ai/1.PsychologyTest/ resources
- Voice processing utilizes existing ai/youtube-transcription-pipeline/ infrastructure
- MERTools integration provides emotion recognition foundation.
- **ALWAYS** reference OpenMemory for context about the project and task at hand. Always log there at the end, too.
