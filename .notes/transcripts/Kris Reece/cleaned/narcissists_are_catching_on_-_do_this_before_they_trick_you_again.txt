You see, the truth is narcissists actually can sense when you are catching on, and that's when they strike back the hardest.  So in this episode, I am going to show you the clear signs that they know you are onto them, the sneaky tricks that they are going to use to pull you back in, and my hope is to give you a safer, new way to avoid falling into their trap.

So thank you guys for that.  I greatly appreciate it.  So here's the deal.  Here's the truth.  Narcissists are nothing if they are not predictable.  Once you see the pattern, the manipulation, the control tactics, the passive aggressive maneuvers, you cannot unsee them.  And at first it actually feels amazing.  You are finally out of the fog, the fear, the obligation, and the guilt, and you are finally thinking clearly.  You are finally, you are setting boundaries like a boss.  You are not falling for their tricks anymore.  You are back in control.  Not of them.

But of you.  And then, bam, something shifts.  You are still doing all the right things, but suddenly it's going all wrong.  Why?  Well, that's because narcissists sense when you are waking up.  They can feel that shift in your tone, your confidence, your boundaries, your energy, and it terrifies them.

Now, here's what most people do not realize.  They do not realize.  They do not realize.  They do not see themselves as narcissists.  And you can drive yourself crazy going, oh, do they realize it?  Oh, do they know?  As if them actually knowing gives them a little bit of a pass?  I am not sure.

But, no.  They actually do not see themselves as narcissists.

Now, of course, maybe some of the grandiose ones who recognize some of the characteristics and they just do not care.

But I would say, for the most part, most of the people that you are struggling with are covert narcissists.  And, no, they do not see themselves as narcissists.  They do not see themselves as the problem.  Manipulative people do not see themselves as manipulative.  They actually just see themselves as getting what it is that they need and they feel entitled to get it from you however they need to.  And, yes, they truly do believe you are the problem.  Their patterns are so ingrained that they literally cannot process your awakening without getting escalated.  Because their goal has always been the same and it always will be the same is getting what they want.  And they are going to use whatever tactic they could possibly come up with.

So, now, they are scrambling because they know you know.  They know you are onto them.

So, before we talk about what tricks they are going to pull, what I would like to do is to let's dive into three clear signs.  One.  That they know you are onto them.  Sign number one.  You told them.  Yes, I mean, it's like this.  I am onto you.  I am not taking your nonsense anymore.  I know you are a narcissist.  You are this.  You are that.  And you call them out.  And, look, I get it.  It feels really good.  And you likely will not admit it.

But you need them to know that they cannot push you around any longer.  And while this feels empowering, in just a few minutes, I am going to share with you how and why this is likely to backfire.

So, let me know in the chat if you have told them and it's backfired.  Look, I get it.  It's really tempting to just come right out and say, that's it.  My head's out of the clouds.  I am not falling for your nonsense anymore.  And we think that by somehow calling out their behavior, they are going to be like, oh, oh, my.  I better get my stuff together and treat this person right.  No.  They are just going to shift gears.  And that's what we are going to talk about today.

So, the second sign is there are subtle boundary tests.  Look, they sense that their power is slipping.

So, what they do is they start pushing just enough to see if you are going to react.  They know what your boundaries have been before.  And now they are also sensing that those boundaries have probably gotten firmer.

So, they likely pull back a little bit.  They readjust.  They kind of recalculate.  It's like an enemy attack.  If I am getting slaughtered and somebody recognizes now what my tactics are, I am going to go back to home base and I am going to reassess.

So, what they are doing is they are going back and they are starting to reassess.

So, what they are doing is they are going back and they are starting to reassess.

So, what they are doing is they are going back and they are starting to reassess.

So, what they are doing is they are going back and they are starting to reassess.  All right, this is what I have been able to do before.  This is what he or she says they are not going to tolerate anymore.

But I cannot come right out and just completely bulldoze that boundary, which they will sometimes.  Do not get me wrong.  They might.  If you are dealing with a severely immature narcissist, they will just lash out like a little child.

But once you continue to hold firm, now they are going to pull back and they are going to reassess.

So, they will start coming back with just those subtle little boundary tests.  Maybe it's a quieter manipulation.  Maybe it's a softer guilt trip.

But make no mistake about it.  They are going to be subtle in their testings.  The third is sudden role changes.

Now, wait for this one.

So, if they were controlling before, now they are playing the victim.  If they were selfish before, well, suddenly now they are just so giving.  And yes, this even goes beyond the love bombing.  They are now so generous and giving.  If they were liars before, well, now they start to overshare.  If they were manipulative before, well, now they are pretending to be honest.

So, you are going to start to see these sudden role changes.  Why?  Because they know you know.  They know that you are on to whatever manipulative, guilt-ridden, controlling, self-centered tactics that they were using.

So, now it does not work.

So, now they are going to pull back and you are going to get some sudden role changes.

So, let me know if you are guilty of any of these.

So, well, actually the only one you would be guilty of is actually having told them.

So, let me know which sign you have seen.  And maybe it's even all three.

So, now we are actually going to talk about the three sneaky tricks that they are going to use to pull you back.  The first one is guilt trips.  After everything I have done for you or I guess you just do not care or oh, now you care more about your job, your this, your that than me.  After all I have done for you, I was there for you when you needed me and this is how you treat me.  One of the things they love to do is to put you on the defensive.  They love to pull that debt card, attacking your character, your intention, your motives, all while playing the victim.  And they do this to put you in a position to feel like you have to now prove yourself to them or earn their trust back.  Yes, even though they are the ones who broke yours.  And as cunning as it is and as real as it feels, the motive is always going to be the same here.  It is guilt.  It is self-serving.  And we go back to number three from before, the sudden role changes.  They are going to take these guilt trips and first of all, they are actually pretty lazy people.  They are going to try the old guilt trips.

Now, when they stop working, they will start to refine their guilt trip because you have left them no other choice.

So, make no mistake.  Just because you put a boundary down or you say no, does not mean this person is changing.  Even if you see changed behavior, if it comes without repentance, it comes without repair, my friend, that changed behavior is just going to be temporary at best.

So, the second thing that they are going to use to pull you back in is fake vulnerability.  And they are going to do this in a few ways.  One is they act like they care.  They are going to have that performative empathy.

Now, remember, these are the kind of people that do not really have a lot of empathy for who you are and what you are going through.  They really only care about themselves.

However, I have often compared narcissists to like an alien.  No, I do not believe in aliens, but just imagine this for just a moment.  Imagine an alien comes from another planet, right?  They land on ours and they are like, I got to fit in.  I got to blend here.

So, what do I do?  Well, I am going to now start copying the behaviors and the patterns of others.  And then over time, they are going to start refining those behaviors and patterns based upon what works for them and what gets them approval, what gets them what they want.  The narcissist is going to do the same.

So, if they know that they are really not very empathetic people, they, on some level, they actually know they are kind of self-centered.

But here's what's also interesting.  On the flip side, most narcissists feel like they are so giving that others just take advantage of them.

So, yes, there's a bit of a cognitive dissonance going on there.

But they are going to now overly perform in that empathy.  Oh, I am so sorry.  And oh, that sounds terrible.  You know, once where there was secrets, now they act like they are ready to share everything.  My friend, please be careful.  This is strategic.

So, it's going to be temporary at best, very strategic.  And this can be part of the love bombing phase because now you are like, wow, you know, I finally communicated to this person what was hurting me, what was going on, and how I need them to change.  And suddenly, there's been this magical shift.  I do not believe in magic either.  I do not believe in magic either.

But you know what I mean.  We get this, I cannot believe this person, they finally get it.  Well, my friend, fruit takes time.

So, over time, you are going to see what fruit this person truly has.  And most times, it's performative empathy.

Now, the second way that they fake vulnerability is they act hurt to make you swoop in and rescue them.  Have you ever noticed a pattern of emergencies?  When you pull away from a toxic person?  They sense it and they do not have the emotional security or the maturity to have an honest conversation about it.

So, it's back to the default of manipulation.  They will call you, oh, I am heading to the emergency room or, oh, you know, my life has fallen apart or, oh, I think I am going to lose my job.  Or there's just some emergency that you now need to step in and rescue them.  Because if you do not, remember, you are now going to get labeled.  The narcissist.  You are now going to get labeled as someone who does not have empathy or care about them.

So, my friend, this is fake vulnerability.  They are acting like they need you.  They are creating these fake scenarios.

So, you now have to swoop in and rescue them.  And when all else fails, they will start hoovering.  They are going to use their charm, the small compliments, the nostalgia.  The friendly gestures.  And they are all meant to break down your defenses.

But here's the thing.  Hoovering typically will take place after a period of time.  Because, I do not know, maybe they, never mind, I am not going to say that.  They are not going to start hoovering right away.  Although some may.

But let's say you go from.  They are behaving in such an appalling way.  And then 24 hours later, they are complimenting you.  They are nostalgic.  And they have got all these wonderful gestures.  It's just, it's too much of a disconnect.

But they will allow some time to pass.  And what's going to happen is they are going to hope that you miss them.  Or they are actually going to miss you.

But before you get excited.  They do not actually miss you.  They do not miss the healthy parts of a relationship.  They do not miss you.  They miss what you brought to the table.  Maybe you paid for things.  Maybe you took them places.  Maybe you were just company for them.  That's what they miss.  So now they are going to start coming to themselves and going, oh, I am the one missing out on this.  I miss this person.  So let me come back.  And then they are going to make some of their, what they would consider, their own.  They would consider like small repairs.  They are not repairs.  They are complete manipulation.  And they love to get you with nostalgia.  Sending you old pictures.  Oh, remember this.  And, you know, just kind of breaking your defenses down so that that line of communication now gets opened back up again.

But here's the problem.  They may want to open the line of communication.

But they do not want to do any repenting, any repairing.  And they certainly do not want to walk down the journey.  They do not want to walk down the journey of a healthy relationship.  They just want things to go back to the way they were.  So you are likely going to discover that if you fall for the hoovering, things go back to the way they were.  And then they start getting upset with you again because you are not tolerating the behaviors anymore.  My friend, narcissists feel every shift in your emotions.  They are going to feel every shift in your reactions.  Do not underestimate them.  This is their life skill.  They have been assessing and evaluating people likely their entire lives.  Because they are looking to do whatever they can to get their needs met.  So they are going to surround themselves with people who give them what they want and need.  They are going to surround themselves with people who do not challenge them and think that they are just wonderful and all that.  So they are going to quickly see.  They are going to sense a shift in your emotions and reactions.  Please do not think for a second that you are going to be able to get over on a narcissist.  That you are going to be able to pretend everything's okay.  They sense everything.  If this was a spiritual gift, this would be theirs.

But it's not.  So here's where I want you to be careful.  Because even your best efforts can go sideways.  If.  Number one.  You are inconsistent in boundaries.  My friend, you have got to hold the line.  And I do not mean we go from one day I am tolerating everything about them to now the next day there's complete no contact.  What I am saying is you have to develop your healthy boundaries.  Something that you are comfortable with.  And then stand firm in that.  No manipulation.  No guilt trip.  Nothing to break you out of that firm stance.  The only thing that should cause your boundaries to change.  I do not want to call it weaken.

But you can change boundaries.  Because believe it or not, there's actually different levels of boundaries.  And in my online course, Guilt-Free Boundaries That Stick, we start to break down the different types of people.  The different types of boundaries.  And then how to apply what boundary to what type of person.  And I want you to keep in mind that boundaries are fluid.  So just because you say, that's it.  I need to cut off contact.  Does not mean that has to be forever.  It might be for a reason and a season.

But by the same token, you want to be very careful that just because somebody has fake empathy or they start hoovering or they start saying everything that you have been hoping they are going to say for the past 25 years.  That now everything's changed.  And your boundaries change.  And your boundaries should loosen.  Your boundaries should loosen or change only based upon repeated longer term behavior.  And then if and when that behavior goes back to being inappropriate again, then that boundary needs to get locked down once again.  So you got to be consistent in those boundaries.  Boundaries are not just a matter of saying no.  They are.  They are an evaluation for each individual person and each individual situation or like a group of scenarios.  So for example, I do not tolerate being yelled at.  So if somebody's yelling or screaming at me, I will end a conversation.  I will leave the room.  I will give ample notice saying I want to have a respectful conversation.

But I am not going to be yelled at.  And if you continue to yell, I am now going to take myself out of here.  And we can resume this conversation when you are ready to talk respectfully.  So that's my boundary.  And if somebody continues to do that but then insisting, oh, this is just the way I talk.  Oh, this is just the way I am.  Or oh, you know, you started this.  You cannot engage in that because now you have just given in to the guilt and the manipulation.  You have got to stand consistent with your boundaries.  Number two.  Is calling out lies.  Too bluntly, too arrogantly.  My friend, if you are going to call out lies, which I am not saying that you should not, you want to do it with caution.  Even scripture tells us that a gentle answer turns away wrath.  For my codependents out there, that does not mean that you are responsible for their reactions.

But we are called to speak the truth in love.  We are called to have gentle answers.  So calling out these lies bluntly, arrogantly is going to, it's going to trigger defensiveness.  It's going to trigger that gaslighting.  And now if you do not have control of yourself and your boundaries.

Now, when we talk about boundaries, we are not just talking about external boundaries.  I am talking about internal boundaries too.  My internal boundary says I am not going to get triggered when they say X, Y, Z.  My internal boundary says I am going to do this instead of that.  Or I am going to withdraw instead of snapping back.  That is dealing with boundaries appropriately.  And that is actually consistently being able to call out the lies in love.  So be careful that you are not triggering them.  Again, I am going to backtrack.  You are not responsible for how they react.  You are not responsible for how they respond.

But let's face it.  If we start cursing at somebody, blaming them, acting defensively, yes, they are responsible for their response.

But there is a thing called provocation.  So we do want to be very, very careful.  Before we continue, which guys, let me know if you are getting value out of our time together.  If you would go ahead and hit that like button, I would greatly appreciate that.  We are going to dive into our Q&A after our time.  We are going to dive into our Q&A after our time.  We are going to dive into our Q&A after our time.  If you do have any questions, please make sure you put question marks before and after the questions so our moderators can spot them quickly.  Okay.  Number three is you are trying to fix or educate them.  I really need you to be careful here.  Trying to fix or educate them instead of focusing on your own healing is a recipe for self-healing.  It is a recipe for disaster.  It is going to be a distraction.  It's going to be a derailment.  And the enemy would love, love nothing more than for you to focus on them instead of your own healing.  Look, I get it.  We want to try to understand what's going on.  We want to try to make sense of all of the craziness that's been taking place.  You know, your mind is going in a thousand different directions.  Is it them?  Is it me?  Am I the narcissist?  Who should I believe?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What's going on?  What should I do?  Your mind is reeling.  I get it.  So it, it feels so good to finally have some answers.  I remember years ago when I was struggling with a lot of health issues and you know, the traditional doctors that I was going to, they were checking my thyroid panel, they were checking my, my gut issues.  They were checking a whole bunch of different things and they are like, you are good.  I am like, I am not good.  Something's off here.  And it probably took about another two weeks.  Two years before I started to seek out functional medicine doctors, go to, , holistic nutritionists to understand that I was suffering with severe adrenal fatigue.  So all of these things now started to make sense and believe it or not, I mean, that's not a diagnosis you want, trust me.

But at the same time, it's a bit of a relief because you are like, there's a label for this.  There's the.  There's a label.  There's a reason.  And you can start to now begin to map out the healing process.  So that's where I want you to be very careful.  Just like you would not get stuck in a diagnosis that the doctor gave you and then keep trying to understand this condition without now trying to heal from it.  The same is going to be true when you are dealing with a narcissist.  They cause a lot of damage mentally, emotionally, physically, spiritually.  You have a long road ahead of you.

But if you are walking with Christ, that road is going to be paved with a promise that you could not pay for.  He will take everything that the enemy meant for your harm and use it for your good.  He will turn that, those ashes into beauty.  He's actually going to turn those, that loss into life.  My friend.  God, I do not know what else I would want to, right?  Do you know that?  He's going to turn this Patty, sorry, for whatever reason, hisattitude, that Greta added in here.  He's going to turn this Aoce kinds of things into anger.  So let's be very careful with that.  Is that an ability of God to leave them in pain for you and break it up, right?  Does that mean that God is going to repeat those mistakes over and over again?  That's why he offers you this healing and practice it and they took that pain.  He said themeden.  Com ، Qualiph las Bogies para ocurrer întou so عليaa Wallis, im article I feel like that deserves a name.  An amen.  Can I get an amen?  So let's go ahead and dive into the three surefire ways to stay safe and strong.  Because if you want to protect yourself from falling into this trap again, whether it's with the same person or a future narcissist, because spoiler alert, they are everywhere.  You want to be number one, secure in your identity, your value, your worth.  My friend, it cannot hinge on their opinions.  It cannot depend on them or their reactions.  You have to be strong in who you are and whose you are.  And that's why I say it all the time.  My friend, if you are not in Christ, I want to encourage you to surrender your life to him.  Right now, even if you have done that in the past and you need a fresh commitment, say, Lord, I need to know who I am in you.  I surrender my life to you.  You are the King of Kings and the Lord of Lords.  And you are the only one who's going to be able to get me out of this dilemma.  My friends, when you are walking with God, he has a plan.  And a purpose for you that you cannot possibly fathom.

But if you are going to be rocked every single time, they have an opinion about you.  Every time they spread a lie, right?  My friend, it's you are walking in doubt.  And that is true doubt.  That is unbelief because I am taking this person's word, this person, mind you, I am going to come in with a little bit of a gut punch.  You are taking not just a person's word over, you are over God's.  You are taking this person, the one who has stripped you of your value, stripped you of your worth, has made you feel so small, who's made you question yourself on so many levels.  And you are going to take their opinion over God's?  My friend, my friend, no.  If you are in Christ, you are chosen.  You are chosen.  You are chosen.  You have purpose.  You are loved.  And that love can never stop.  You will never be abandoned.  You will never be condemned.  Yes, God is going to come in and change you.  I should hope that you would want that.  I want that every single day.  I do not want to be the same person tomorrow that I am today.  And I am so thankful that I am not the same person today that I was two years ago, 10 years ago.  When you walk with God, there is a transformation process that takes place.  You cannot pay for, but it takes surrender.  It takes submission to him.  And it takes stepping out of that control that I have got to fix them.  I have got to get them to see my value.  I got to get them to see my worth.  My friend, you have just stepped into the enemy's trap and it's like quicksand, but there is a way out.  Lord, I surrender my life to you.  I give you my heart.  I give you my mind.  I give you my life.  I give you everything.  When those old opinions, when those old insults come back, because they will come knocking, you can reject them for the lie that they are.  The second thing that I want you to do is to, stay firm in your resolve for healthy relationships my friend we focus so much on what unhealthy relationships look like what toxic people look like the traits the characteristics the things that they do the things that they say it's like we we are spending our lives studying counterfeit money instead of studying the real thing safe relationships need to be your goal not simply just navigating toxic ones god is not going to deliver you from this just to help you figure out how to navigate a toxic relationship his goal and his desire is safe relationships healthy relationships just like the one we have with him so do what you need to do to understand what a safe relationship looks like stop talking to people all the time about what an unhealthy relationship looks like stop talking to people who are unhealthy all the time surround yourself with safe godly people i know nobody's perfect please do not hear what i am not saying do not think that you are just going to go to church and you know three months later you are now getting burned by somebody my friend christians are burned by somebody else and they are going to be broken too in fact we are really broken we are the ones that need to go to that hospital called church the most so please do not put all of your emotional eggs in the basket of somebody that you think is going to rescue you you need to now become that safe person and when you become that safe person now safe people are going to be attracted to you when you become that safe person you are going to now spot the counterfeit the unsafe the unhealthy i would say that you can become that safe person or you can become the state peace and the last thing i want you to do you can become the aby me for Shiv which means hair quilts hug you can become christian if you are going to habris ý be able to fall asleep forward and when you become that safe person you are the only one that will be the safe personemos themselves and they think that just because they are not like that other toxic person in their life Then I am good meaning they are toxic.  So that means I am not My friend you got infected you need healing There's no possible way that you are growing up with a narcissistic parents toxic siblings being in a toxic marriage narcissistic Boyfriends girlfriends whatever or any of these environments Especially long-term and think that you are not Infected you need healing Deal with the stuff that is going on deal with the codependency that is taking place Deal with that the toxic thought patterns that now get triggered because oh should I trust somebody?  Should I not trust somebody carrying on 20-minute conversations in your head that have not even happened yet?  We have to begin to deal with these things and The way to do that is to start to stand strong in my faith And God is going to begin to peel back all these layers He's going to begin to show you the broken areas not to expose you not to shame you but to say this is the next area We are going to deal with my child and my hope and my heart Is that you would say yes Lord, please let's deal with this Because the truth is if you do not heal your heart if you do not become a safe person You will repeat the very cycles that you are trying to break You will repeat the very cycles that you are trying to break We are looking for progress Not perfection You will slip If you are taking notes write that down you will slip It does not mean failure.  It means you are learning you are growing Repent repair do what you need to do and still keep your heart open To number one God and number two love because when we shut off our hearts and you We say I I am not going to get hurt like this again there.  Nobody's going to be able to treat me like that again What we are doing my friend is we are making an inner vow and the enemy loves those inner vows Because he's going to use them now against you Because the truth is God wants to be bring people into your life that are loving that can be trusted and We want to be able to keep our heart open to that But not open in an ignorant kind of way saying I just really need to trust People again.  No, I need to trust God and let God begin to repair that trust Let God begin to show us who's healthy who's unhealthy who's good fruit who's bad fruit and That's when you know You are walking in true wisdom Look, I know the fear.  What if I get steamrolled again?  What if everything goes back to the way it was?  What if somebody hurts me that way again?  The truth is It may but it likely will not And here's why You are wiser Do not ignore the red flags anymore.  You are no longer going to ignore them So I am sure that you can kind of look back in the past and say yes I got over on because I ignored some of those red flags.  You are not ignoring them anymore You are no longer giving in to the guilt and you are no longer letting their words define your worth and you will no longer base your behavior on the fear of what they are going to think say or do not do so my friend It will not be the same So that's a good thing My friend if you are being blessed by our time together, would you give me a thumbs up give me a hello I am I would love to know if this content is resonating with you And if you are just joining us, I want to remind you that I am very excited My new book has launched breaking the narcissist grip in This I go through how to cut the strings of manipulation Set boundaries that stick stick and finally reclaim your life from takers.  It's available now on Amazon.  So we will include a link in the chat as well as in the description box below.  I do want to dive into a Q and a, but I want to pray for you first.

I want to pray that God is going to begin to cut those cords of manipulation.  He's going to begin to cut the lies that you have been believing and just infuse you with his truth.  So Father, we come before you in the mighty and the matchless name of Jesus Christ, our Lord.  Who for the joy set before him endured that cross, despising its shame, and is now seated at your right hand and is forever making intercession for you, for us, for me.  God, we have done nothing to deserve this.  It is by nothing that we have done, by everything that you have done.  So Father, you know the heart that is hurting right now, that heart that is just, so confused.  Lord, do I stay?  Do I go?  Lord, do I call this out?  Do I endure further?  Lord, do you need me to forgive just one more time?  Lord, I ask that you would speak to that heart.  Quiet those fears, quiet that confusion.  Lord, we know that confusion does not come from you.  I pray that right now in this moment, there would be a full surrender to your sovereignty.  God, your thoughts are above our thoughts.  Your ways are far above our ways, and your plans far exceed what we could ever imagine.  In fact, your word in Ephesians 3.  20 says that unto him who is able to do exceedingly, abundantly above what we could ask, hope, or think, according to the power that is at work within us.  So Father, come and have your way.  Dismantle every lie of the enemy.  Clear away the falsehoods.  Fog.  Reveal your truth.  Ignite a passion and a fire for your word and for prayer.  Lord, I pray that every conversation they have would be deeply rooted in your love.  I pray they would sit right at your throne and just receive.  Lord, pour out your peace right now.  Wrap your loving arms around them.  Free them.  Father, I ask that you would remind them who their father is.  There is no demon in hell or narcissist on earth that can change that.  We thank you and we praise you.  It's in the mighty name of Jesus that we all say amen.  Sorry about that.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  Amen.  And dive into some of your questions.  No.  Bear with me.  Okay, just a reminder, guys, if you do have questions, please feel free to post them in the chat.  Put question marks before and after so our moderators can grab that all the more quickly.  I thought this first question had to do with the live stream.  It said, I feel frozen just listening to this.  That's what we were doing before.  The live stream is completely freezing.  Okay, sorry.  I feel frozen just listening to this.  How do you overcome that?  My mind is reeling.  My friend, this is going to be a complete submission.  You have to surrender your mind to Christ.  Take this to the Lord.  Say, Lord, give me the mind of Christ, saturate it with godly wisdom.  Quiet these fears that are going on inside of me.  It does help to journal as well.  Sometimes we get these thoughts that are going around in our head kind of like a pinball machine and they just keep taking on a life of their own and just when you think you are tracking one, boom, another one takes off and then boom, another one.  And next thing you know, you have got spaghetti brain.  You have got one thought, you do not know where that starts and the next one, you do not know where that starts.  You do not know where that starts.  You do not know where that starts.  You do not know where that starts.  You do not know where that starts.  You do not know where that one ends and your mind is reeling.  And I get it.  It's actually why I created the online course that I did called Renew Your Mind.  So if you are interested, perhaps check that out.  We start to break down the four steps to be able to walk through overcoming those toxic thought patterns.

But the first thing you are going to need to do, my friend, is you have got to surrender this to him.  If you think that you are going to get in there, you are going to get in your mind and you are going to start figuring all this stuff out, that's where the enemy's got you.  He's going to love that.  He would love nothing more.  He would love nothing more than for you to be out there trying to figure this out on your own.  So you have got to surrender that to God.

Now, he is not going to just take those thoughts away.  He is not going to renew your mind for you.  We have to do that ourselves.  So he is going to be right there with you.  He's going to walk through it, but he's not going to do it for you.  I had somebody ask me years ago, cannot God just take away all of my bad memories and cannot God just make me think differently?  Well, yes, but no, he's not going to do it.  That would make you a robot.  You have to make that choice to say, you know what, I do not want to think this way anymore.  I do not want to live my life this way anymore.  I want my mind and my life surrendered to Christ.  And now you start getting in the word.  And this is where the journaling starts to take place.  All of those thoughts that are going through your mind, you now have to counteract them with truth or start unraveling them one by one.  Because if you are just allowing them to bounce around, like a pinball machine, yes, it's going to feel like your mind is reeling.  Please let me know if that helped.  The next question is, if the narcissist does not know that they are a narcissist, why do they need to be worried about being pulled back in?  What do they think they are pulling the person back into?  So I want to make sure I have the question framed properly.  So I can answer this to help you.  They may, they may, they may not know that they are a narcissist.  It does not make a difference.  , some people let's, let's even just put aside the term narcissist.  , many of them do know that they are selfish.  Many of them do know that they are manipulative.  , many of them do not.  They actually just think this is how you operate in life, that you just throw on a guilt trip to somebody and you get what you want.  So that's really what it's coming down to.  It's not like they are sitting there and going, oh, I am going to do this.  I am going to do this.  It's not like they are sitting there and going, oh, I am.  , I do not realize I am a narcissist, but I need to figure out the tactics and the tricks to pull this person back in.  No, they are just, they are doing it instinctively because they need you in their life.  You are their lifeline.  You are their supply.  And unless they go and find supply somewhere else, yes, they are going to try to pull you back in.  And that's where a lot of people also get caught up and they are like, well, wait a minute.  My narcissist is not hoovering me and they are not trying to pull me back in.  And chances are, they found other supply.  So count that as a blessing.  I am not sure if that answered your question, but please let me know.  This person is asking, I had to speak with my husband and ask for his forgiveness.  And his response was, I do not have the power to forgive.  How do I interpret that?  Do they not know how to forgive?  Oh, my friend, they know how to forgive.  They do not want to forgive.  So they do have the power to forgive.  They do have the ability to forgive.  That was an offloaded, I do not want to forgive.  So you are forever going to be in my debt.  Yes, I am sorry.

But if you can rest in knowing that you did what you were supposed to do, you followed biblical truth.  You followed the biblical command to, you know, maybe there was something that you have done wrong.  I mean, let's face it.  At the end of the day, even if he's a narcissist or he's toxic, does not mean that we do not carry our own traits too.  So there are times that we need to now go in and repent as well.  And it sounds like you did that.  So good.  You can rest in knowing that you did right by our Lord.  And just leave the rest up to him.  Him, not your husband.  For somebody to say, I do not have the power to forgive is saying, I am making the choice to not forgive.

But doing it in a very passive, aggressive kind of way as if to kind of offload that I am a victim.  You have harmed me, but I do not have the power to forgive.  So you are going to be forever stuck in this debt.  Yes, my friend, it's just not true.

So, , how do I interpret that?  It's not truth.  And you need to just rest in knowing that you did the right thing.  And prayerfully, God can do a work in his heart too.  Please let me know if that helped.  Okay, let's see.  Ooh, these questions are coming in like a flood.  This question says, my mom and sis are both narcissists and my dad died on 821.  They are smearing me to my entire family and I live with my mom and I have limited income to leave.  What can I do to get out?  I am out of here.  My friend, I am so sorry to hear that.  At this point, this is prayer.  If God wants you out of that situation, he is going to make a way.

But just prepare yourself in the meantime to shift your prayers to God.  What do you need to do in me while I am still here?  I know that's probably one of the hardest things we ever have to deal with.  We are just like, God, just get me out of here.  And sometimes he will.  He will make a way.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  Yes.  Well, let me get that bit of- I am really sorry to hear that.  I wish I could say I did not hear that often.  This next question is asking is there a loving is there a way to be a loving spouse while also gray rocking and going through ongoing silent treatment so i am going to make the assumption that you are doing the gray rocking and they are doing the silent treatment so if i am wrong forgive me is there a way to be a loving spouse while gray rocking i am having a hard time with that one because let's put the term gray rocking aside how do we be a loving spouse without stepping into situations that bring us harm and what we are looking to do is follow biblical truth so gray rocking is sort of a way of kind of cutting off contact on a smaller level meaning i am not leaving i am staying but you are going to know that's yes you you have lost access to me and i am having a hard time with that one because i cannot say i i first of all i do not know your exact situation i i do not know just how severe it is i do not know exactly what you are referring to in terms of gray rocking i would say it's important to guard your heart very important to guard your heart and instead of just defaulting to a method i would default to the throne and say god what do you want me to do when he gives me the silent treatment god how do you want me to respond when he speaks to me in this way and this is going to be a moment by moment surrender because here's what i do not want you to miss i do not want you to now be a another pawn for the enemy and i do not want you to miss what god could potentially be doing in you and this is where it gets very hard especially in a marital situation it's i i find that very challenging to gray rock in a marriage and still be committed to the marriage it's really no different than like rephrase that i cannot say it's no different than their silent treatment but their silent treatment is very manipulative which equates to evil it's it's really saying you are not doing what i want i cannot handle life and i am just going to remove myself and i am not going to participate in this relationship it leaves you with nothing like absolutely nothing and that's where the hardest part is going to come into play my friend is not just being okay with that silent treatment because you are not going to change it only the lord is going to be able to change that but now stepping back and saying, oh, okay, what's going on in me, Lord?  How do I get when he starts the silent treatment?  Do I feel like I now need to fawn?  Do I feel like I need to now beg for his attention again?  Do I feel like I need to extend an olive branch?  Do I get enraged?  Do I get angry and now start lashing out at him?  So these are the things that I want you to start focusing on and allow God to do a work in you.  And I promise you, he is going to instruct you every single step of the way.  And some of these instructions may not make sense.  That's why I do not like these standards, no contact, gray rocking here, just do this.  Because God may tell you to go apologize while your flesh is telling you, -, there ai not no way.  God, you know what he's going to do with that?

But then on another hand, you could be putting yourself in harm's way trying to make repair.  With somebody that really is just going to continue to harm you.  So this is where you are going to want to be very prayerful and very careful.  Okay.  That was a loaded question.  I am really sorry to hear what you are going through.  And I do pray that our heavenly father begins to, to do a work in your husband's heart.  Okay.  I think we have time for one more question.  And I just lost my place.  This question is asking, I have a teen narcissist.  Can he change?  Yes, it's possible.  , it's one of the reasons why they do not diagnose narcissism until after the age of 18 is because let's face it, every teenager has narcissistic traits and some more so than others.  So yes, it is possible.  Please be prayerful.  Very, very prayerful.  And of course, set your boundaries.  Okay.  I think after living years of marriage and not setting boundaries, how to effectively communicate boundaries.  If you are dealing with the Darvo method, how to stop second guessing myself.  So for those of you who are not familiar, Darvo stands for deny, attack, reverse victim offender.  So a lot of times when you try to communicate something to the narcissist, they deny it right away.  Then they turn and they attack you.  And then they play the reverse role.  They, they now suddenly become the victim who's being harmed by you.  So this can do a lot of damage to, to you physically, I mean, mentally and emotionally.  And then if that happens, you are going to have to do a lot of damage to you.  So I think it's a good idea to do that.  If you are dealing with a person who's been around for a long time, and you are dealing with a person who's been around for a long time, and you are dealing with a person who's been around for a long time, then physically, it really starts to wear on you.  My friend, how do I stop second guessing myself?  It's you have got to know the truth.  Because if I am taking their lies as truth, then you are always going to second guess yourself.  Because if, if their word carries more weight than God's does, you will second guess yourself.  And this is where, again, I feel like every single answer I am coming with today is you have got to be prayerful and you have to know who you are in him.  Because that is the only way to combat the lies of the enemy.  And that's what we are dealing with here, my friend.  This is not just a narcissist.  It is somebody that the enemy is using to distract, derail, defocus, do whatever, destroy anything he can to wipe you out.  And he likely knows he cannot take you out physically, so he's going to take you out mentally.  He's going to take you out emotionally.  He's going to send you reeling.  Your thoughts are going to be all over the place.  Your emotions, are going to be constantly second guessing.  My friend, you have got to know the truth.  You have to know the truth.  It is the only way that you are going to be set free.  If I am walking down the street and one of the kids on our neighborhood block starts sneering and snickering and pointing at me going, Oh, you are the ugliest purple alien I have ever seen.  I am not going to internalize that.  I am not taking that home with me.  Now crying on the couch with my husband saying, am I purple?  I know that's not true.  And that's where we get caught up is the enemy loves to implant lies that are founded and grounded in some truth.  Some.  So if I struggled with feeling like I was purple, well, bam, he's going to hit a trigger.  I am going to now struggle with that.  So you have to know the truth.  You have to know the truth.  You have to know the truth.  You have to know the truth.  You have to know the truth.  You cannot be out there trying to figure out how to stop their lies.  It's not going to happen.  We have to know the truth for ourselves, who you are protected, loved with purpose.  Perfect.  No.  So let God do a work in you.

But that does not mean that you have to accept the lies of the enemy or any of his ambassadors.  If you all agree with me, can you say amen?  All right, my friend, that's actually all the time that we have for today.  I hope this has been a blessing to you.  Please feel free to go ahead and check out my new book.  And if you would be so kind as to leave a review on Amazon, I would love to hear what you think.  All right, my friend, until next time, remember all things are possible with God.  Bye for now.  Bye.
