Okay, so have you ever felt like your emotions are on a roller coaster that you cannot control?  That is emotional dysregulation.  So when your feelings seem to have a mind of their own.  And today we are getting real about this, like really misunderstood experience with an article from our very own Sandstone Care.  Emotional dysregulation, 11 types, causes, and best treatments.  And it's a lot, Deb, but it's so relevant.  It really is, Clint.  And it's packed with insights.  You know, the first thing that stood out to me was how they define emotional dysregulation.  Like it's not just being emotional, right?  It's about struggling to control those emotional responses.  Yes, and that struggle can look like so many things, which is why they break it down into three core types of emotion regulation.  You have got your attentional control, cognitive reappraisal, and response modulation.  And those are not just psych jargon.  This is really useful stuff.  So stick with us.  Okay, so unpack that a little bit for me.  What do those even really mean?  So basically, attentional control is about focus.  Can you shift your attention away from something upsetting?  And then cognitive reappraisal is how you interpret a situation.  Like, is it a catastrophe or just a Tuesday?  Yes.  And response modulation, that's about the intensity of your reaction.  You know, a measured response or a total meltdown.  Okay, so there are examples like someone cuts you off in traffic.  Attentional control is if you can stay focused on driving safely, instead of getting totally consumed with anger.  And cognitive reappraisal is, you know, maybe they are having a worse day than me, not really assuming that they are out to just ruin your day.  Exactly.  In response modulation.  That's the difference between a quick honk in the horn.  Yes.  And like tailgating them for the next five miles, right?  And these skills or, like, a little bit of a jerk, but they are not going to hurt you.

So, you know, that's a good thing.  They impact every single part of your life, your job, your relationships, even just how you feel about yourself on a daily basis.  So it's like the foundation for being a functional human, basically, which actually brings us to something I know is pretty relevant for you.  ADHD, right?  So this article emphasizes that people with ADHD often experience emotions more intensely, which can make regulation actually pretty tough.  Yes, it's really well explained in the article.  Like, you know how most people find it annoying when they spill their coffee?  Well, for someone with ADHD, that can trigger the same fight or flight response as like a serious threat, which leads to those intense emotional reactions that seem to come out of nowhere.  And makes you realize that it's so much more than just telling someone to calm down or get over it.  You would not tell someone having a panic attack to just chill out.  Right.  And when I think back on my life, I have.

But it's not just about the panic attack.  It's about the panic attack.  It's about the panic attack.  And it's about the panic attack.  And it's about the panic attack.  And it's about the panic attack.  And it's about the panic attack.  And it's about the panic attack.  And it's not just about willpower.  It's about understanding their nervous system, how it might be hardwired to be more reactive, especially if there's a history of trauma.  So even childhood trauma can make the nervous system seem super sensitive.  So it feels like a minor annoyance to one person can feel like a full blown crisis to another.  Okay, so how do we even begin to untangle that?  Because it's obviously more complicated than just snapping your fingers, right?  And this is where the article gets really helpful, because they start talking about solutions.  So they are talking about solutions for emotional dysregulation.

But what does that even look like?  Is it all about like meditating on a mountaintop and hoping for the best?  Well, mindfulness can be a piece of it.

But the article gets into some more, you know, we will say concrete approaches like dialectical behavioral therapy, also known as DBT, and cognitive behavioral therapy, also known as CBT.  Right.  And do not worry, we are going to give you guys a minute to Google those.  All right, welcome back.  Just kidding.  All right.  So the important thing is that these therapies are not just about like venting your feelings.  They are about equipping you with actual skills to manage those emotions in real time.  So it's less about feeling better right now and more about like building a toolkit to handle whatever comes your way.  Exactly.  Think of it like learning to ride a bike.  You would not expect to just hop on and be a pro, right?  You need practice.  You are going to fall a few times.  Learn what works for you.  Probably.  And you are going to wear a helmet while you are at it.  Yes.  Helmets are a good idea.  And these therapies, they are like providing the training wheels and the helmet for emotional regulation.  They teach you how to recognize your triggers, to challenge those negative thought patterns, and then to find healthier ways to cope with stress.  Okay.  So instead of reacting to every emotional speed bump, you are learning how to navigate them more skillfully.  Yes.  And what I find really insightful is how the article ties this back to the causes of emotion.  If you think about it, you know, if you are on a bike, you are going to be on a bike for a long time.  You are going to be on a bike for a long time.  You are going to be on a bike for a long time.  You are going to be on a bike for a long time.  And when you are on a bike, you are going to have a lot of anxiety and you are going to have a lot of anxiety.  And so that's why people are so focused on the emotional dysregulation.  Remember, they said it's often a symptom of something bigger.  It's not a disorder on its own.  Right.  Like anxiety, PTSD, BPD, even autism.  So you could be trying all the coping mechanisms in the world.

But if you are not addressing the underlying cause, it's kind of like putting a bandaid on a broken bone.  First of all.  Problem and then finding the most effective path forward.  Which really sometimes it might involve medication.  Absolutely.  Medication, it can be incredibly helpful for managing those symptoms of the underlying conditions like anxiety or ADHD.

But it's not a cure all.  Exactly.  And this is a really important point.  Medication can be a powerful tool, but it's not a magic solution that instantly gives you those emotional regulation skills.  It's like the difference between turning down the volume on a siren and figuring out how to shut the damn thing off.  You might get some temporary relief from lowering the volume, but you are still going to be on edge until you can actually address the source of the noise.  Right?  Absolutely.  And that's why the article emphasizes the importance of therapy alongside any medication.  It's about addressing both the symptoms and the underlying mechanisms driving them.  So we are talking about emotional regulation as a skill you can build and not like a character flaw that you are just stuck with.

But this is not just about like understanding yourself, is it?  It's about understanding the people around you, too, right?  Yes.  And this is where the article emphasizes all the different ways emotional dysregulation can manifest.  And it is so important.  Because it's not always as obvious as someone like having a meltdown, is it?  Right.  We tend to focus on those outward bursts.

But for some people, emotional dysregulation might look like complete withdrawal or isolation.  Yes.  Even shutting down completely.  And it is so easy to misinterpret that, especially if you are looking for the more obvious signs.  Absolutely.  Someone might seem like they are just being quiet when actually they are battling this like hurricane of emotions and they just do not know how to express it.  Which is why this whole article has really been such an eye opener for me, because it's not about just slapping a label on anyone.  It's about actually understanding that emotional dysregulation exists on a spectrum.  And whether you can relate to it personally or you are seeing it in someone that you love, this resource gives you a starting point.  It really does.  And it highlights how important it is to approach these situations with empathy, not judgment.  Because telling someone to just get over it is about as helpful as selling a fish to climb a tree.  Also, do you talk to fishes?  Very often.  OK, so this conversation, it has sparked a lot of my own curiosity.  And if it sparked yours, definitely check out the full article on Sandstone Care's website under treatment resources, because really we have only scratched the surface, but hopefully it's given you a new perspective on emotional dysregulation.  And maybe even some actionable takeaways to help yourself or someone that you care about, because knowledge is power, right?  And sometimes a little bit of understanding can go a long way.
