# Phase 01: Requirements â€“ Secure Multi-Agent Context Sharing via Cipher

## Goals
- Enable secure, modular, and testable context sharing between Node.js (TypeScript) and Python agents using campfirein/cipher.
- Integrate Cipher with existing memory-bank and agent workflows.
- Ensure all context operations are validated, auditable, and HIPAA++ compliant.

## Functional Requirements

1. **Cipher Client Initialization**
   - Agents (Node.js, Python) must initialize Cipher client using environment variables for secrets.
   - No hard-coded secrets/configs allowed.

2. **Agent Registration**
   - On startup, each agent registers its identity and capabilities with Cipher.
   - Registration must be validated and logged.

3. **Context Sync (Push)**
   - When agent context changes, serialize and encrypt context, then push to Cipher.
   - Context must include agent ID, timestamp, and change reason.

4. **Context Fetch (Pull)**
   - On context request, fetch, decrypt, and validate context from Cipher.
   - Validate context integrity, agent permissions, and compliance.

5. **Error Handling**
   - Handle sync failures, validation errors, unauthorized access, and network issues.
   - Provide clear error codes/messages for each failure type.

6. **Audit Logging**
   - Log all context sync operations (push/pull) for auditability.
   - Audit logs must include agent ID, operation type, timestamp, and compliance status.

7. **Test Hooks**
   - Provide hooks for simulating multi-agent context sharing and conflict resolution.
   - Enable automated tests for registration, sync, validation, error handling, and audit logging.

## Edge Cases

- Missing or invalid secrets/configs.
- Network failures or Cipher service downtime.
- Unauthorized context access attempts.
- Context conflicts between agents (simultaneous updates).
- Data integrity failures (tampering, corruption).
- Audit log write failures.

## Constraints

- All secrets/configs must be loaded from environment variables.
- All context data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- All operations must be HIPAA++ compliant and auditable.
- Pseudocode must remain implementation-agnostic (no library-specific details).
- Each spec module < 500 lines.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Agents can securely register and handshake with Cipher.
- Context push/pull operations are validated, encrypted, and logged.
- Error handling covers all specified failure modes.
- Audit logs are generated for every context operation.
- TDD anchors cover all critical flows and edge cases.

## Glossary

- **Agent**: Node.js or Python process participating in context sharing.
- **Context**: Structured, serializable agent state (memory, intent, etc.).
- **Cipher**: Secure context sharing service (campfirein/cipher).
- **Audit Log**: Immutable record of context operations for compliance.
