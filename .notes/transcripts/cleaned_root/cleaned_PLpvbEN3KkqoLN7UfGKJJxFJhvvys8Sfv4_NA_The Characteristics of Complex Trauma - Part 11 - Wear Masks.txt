We have been working our way through the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, doing a deep dive on them just wanting to really understand what each one is about, how to change and heal, so that we can become healthier people.  And tonight we are going to come to wearing masks.  And I should say I usually do some research on these topics on the internet, and so I put in wearing masks, and I came up in 95 masks, et cetera, for COVID, and then I said psychological masks, and I came up with psychological effect of wearing masks, and it was a really hard topic to research.  So I just had to draw on all the kind of stuff I put together in my mind over the years.  So let's get started.  One of the things that happens when children in complex trauma have to wear masks in order to survive, is they have to be somebody else than who they really are.  They have to adopt roles, they have to take on personas in order to survive.  And as a result of that, they feel like imposters, that they are not authentic, they are not the real them.  And so that's led to what has become known as a technical term called imposter syndrome.  And so most people from complex trauma would have imposter syndrome.  Here's just a simple definition.  Imposter syndrome refers to an internal experience of believing that you are not as competent as others perceive you to be.  In other words, because you have shame, that's all part of wearing masks, whatever you are the mask is you wear, you feel less than that mask.  Somebody else has said this, imposter syndrome is the experience of feeling like a phony.  You feel as though at any moment you are going to be found out as a fraud, like you do not belong where you are, and you only got there through dumb luck.  A graph of or picture of what, how to kind of put it in a picture form.  So in the yellow circle is what you know about yourself.  And because you are wearing masks and being something that you are not, you end up not really knowing who you are.  And so your circle of what you know about yourself is quite small, but you assume that everybody else sees through your mask, they see and know a lot more about you, they know the truth.  Whereas in reality, they do not know anymore probably than you know about yourself.

But for a person with shame who feels like an imposter, the circles on the left are kind of what goes on in their mind.  And so here are the characteristics of imposter syndrome.  So a lot of self doubt because you are just acting apart.  You fear that you will not live up to expectations and inability to realistically assess your competence and skills.  Because you do not really know what you desire, what your passion is because you are not allowed to go there, you just have to perform attributing your success to external factors.  You do not even know what you are doing is genuine and therefore worthy of success.  Be rating your performance.  Overachieving always feel like you are falling short.  Sabotaging your success because you know you are an imposter and you are pretty sure others are going to figure it out sooner or later.  So let's just sabotage.  Having very challenging goals and feeling disappointed when you fall short.  So what I want you to see there is that a person with imposter syndrome never feels good about themselves or what they do.  There's always a fear underneath that they cannot get rid of.  I want you to think of wearing masks from the context of complex trauma.  That's really what this series is about.  How does complex trauma push a child to the point where they need to wear masks in order to survive?  And so I have a series of circles here and it's in the context of shame.  So when a child is abused, abandoned, neglected, their needs are not consistently met, they assume it's their fault and so they feel not good enough.  I must not be lovable, I must not have value.  And so shame is what they believe is their identity, less than.  So that's what they think is at the very center, the real self.  And that they think they have to hide because they think if anybody else sees their real self, they too will abuse them, abandon them, neglect them and not meet their needs.  And so the first thing I want you to see is that is not really their real self.  That is a distorted, mere picture of their real self.

But they think it's the real them that they have to hide.  And so what happens in the dark green circle around them is they are constantly berating themselves, criticizing themselves.  And we talked about that internal critic that's always finding fault with what they see is their real self.  And so to survive, they go to the next circle and create personas, mask, rolls.  And that's what I am going to present to the world.  I am not going to let them see the real self, but I will put on this front.  Hopefully then they will not abuse me and not abandon me and they will meet my needs.  And then in their mind, they have the outside circle, which is, if only I could be like this, then everybody would love me.  So they create this idealized self of what they think they should be.  Now the problem with that is that the inner critic, the shame-based critic, looks constantly at that ideal self circle, compares their current actions to that and always has something else to criticize.  So they always go, I should be there, shame-critic goes, yes, you should be, that means you are a loser and it feeds the shame, it feeds off itself, it keeps all of the shame alive.

But that is what is happening when it comes to wearing masks from the perspective of shame.  Another way to look at people is if you look on the right at an authentic person, who you are and what you do are very, very similar.  You live out of who you are, you act out of who you are.

But a misaligned person who then wears masks is a person who, who they are, is different from what they do.  And they might intersect a little bit, but there's quite a big difference between who they are and what they do.  And so a person who wears masks would be known as a misaligned person.  Now I want to get you to think about wearing masks and multiple purposes for doing it.  From the perspective of the dysfunctional complex trauma family.  So up in the left there's dad, and I am just going to put him as a narcissist.  And it's important to understand that complex trauma in children usually has a parent who has narcissistic tendencies or is a pure narcissist or they both could be, okay.  So I am going to pick dad where it's his way where he wants to be selfish and kids serve him, do what he wants.

But he's there to take care of his needs.  There's a double standard, all kinds of different things are going on.  Typically, he's never satisfied, so there's a lot of anger.  So that's dad on the right is mum.  And she is, he said any price, she enables dad's behavior, she runs around, trying to keep him happy, doing whatever he wants, giving up her needs, making all the sacrifices in order to meet his needs.  So that, you have to have a narcissist and a co-narsicist in order for that relationship to work.  So it's not healthy, but they figure out kind of how to make it work.  And then I am going to put three children who come into the world.  So these children all have needs.  One of those needs is they want to connect with mum and dad.  Another need is they need to be validated by mum and dad.

But they also sense there's a lot of anger in the household and that's making them feel unsafe so they want to get rid of the anger.  So let me just walk you through that in more detail.  Picture yourself living in that home and many of you have lived in that home.  And number one priority for the children of that home is do not get dad angry.  Do it ever it takes to keep him happy.  That is the number one need.  Now often what happens on top of that is mum, the enabler is going to be putting pressure on the kids to do it dad wants to just stop doing that because you will make dad angry.  You better do that because you do not want to get dad angry.  So mum, both parents now are putting pressure on children to behave in ways that prevent dad from getting angry.  And so that means they have these two authorities in their life that they have to keep happy which means they cannot be real, they cannot be authentic.  To be authentic would make dad angry which would make mum angry and then they would be in big trouble.  So in other words, the children in many ways are acting like the parents because the parents are acting like little children.  The children are the true victims of self-centered narcissistic parent but yet the parents are acting like they are the victims.  Like dad, you got to keep him happy, he's going to blame everybody for his problems.  He's going to act like a victim.  So the children are in these reverse roles where they are truly children, truly victims but they have to act like parents taking care of adults who are acting like victims.  And many of you relate to that.  And so the first priority then is we need to reduce the anger and the tension in this house.  We need to keep people happy.  Secondly, we need to get our needs met.  We want to be treated with respect.  We want it to be loved unconditionally, accepted, validated.  We want to fit into this social system of mum and dad and our family.  So that's a priority in the brain and we want to connect with our parents.  The problem is when we try to connect by being authentic, we are getting rejected, we are getting shamed, we are getting punished.  So if we want to connect, we have to be inauthentic.  We cannot be authentic, we have to be something other than we really are.  And then because we do not feel good about ourselves, because we feel all this shame less than, we wonder if maybe we act differently, we will be treated better, we will be treated as valuable and lovable and that will heal our shame, that will fix our shame.  Problem.  And then a lot of the emotions that we experience right now are painful, negative emotions.  And the brain is wondering, is there a way to get these negative emotions to go away?  So those are six different priorities.  That the child has at a subconscious level in his brain.  So here's the brain's solution to the problem.  Number one, do not be authentic.  Being authentic always makes things worse.  It always results in pain.  And so where mass, adapt, if you are going to get your needs met, if you are going to reduce the total amount of anger in the household, if you are going to make your emotions feel better, if you are going to connect, if you are going to get rid of your shame, you have to adapt and adopt a role or wear mass that will get you accepted, that will get you validated, that will make people want to connect with you, that will make people respect you.  So adapt, adapt, adapt.  And so typically we talk about some of the roles that children develop in order to try to get these six competing priorities met.  So the hero child, and they are going to be the perfect child, the responsible child, they are going to take care of everybody's needs, they are going to do extra chores, they are going to be the angel, never get into trouble.  And their hope is, if I am not way, then dad will not be angry, mom will be happy with me, people will like me and want to be with me, people will respect me, that will make me feel better about myself, then I can connect with people, see, if I am the hero, it will meet all six of those needs.  And then some go to the comedian route, let's just not have any anger or sadness, let's just be happy all the time, so I am going to be funny, I am going to be a great storyteller, a joke teller, I am going to pull practical jokes, I am going to always keep the mood light and keep everybody laughing, and then everybody will want to be my friend, everybody will want to hang around me, and so that will help me connect, that will help me be respected and accepted and belong, and all the anger will be gone, well, being a comedian seems to fit and meet all of the different needs that my priorities, that my brain has.  And then there's the invisible child, and they say I am not going to have any needs, I am not going to be a burden to anybody, because if I am not a burden, if I am not in the way, if I am not annoying, then nobody will be angry, then maybe people will respect me and look up to me as being such a wonderful child.  And so that will meet all of these six competing priorities, and so what I want you to understand is that the masks that these children wear were adaptations to survive, adaptations to try to get many different needs met, and they seem to work for a little while, now I should point out that for some children they try multiple roles and masks just to see which one seems to work best for them, and sometimes they use one mask with one person and a different mask with a different person, and they are good at slipping back and forth between the two, almost becoming a chameleon, but that is what they do to survive, and that is so key to understand, it seems to work to get the needs met, now we are going to see that in the long run it does not work, but to a child it seems to help, and one of the things that makes it difficult for the child, and again all this is happening at a subconscious level, one of the things that makes it difficult is that sometimes when they wear that mask they get validated as being a good kid, a wonderful kid, maybe once in a while the mask does not work, they get punished or made fun of, but inconsistent rewards is what I am driving at here, and that always gives a child hope, that maybe the next time I put on that mask or adopt that role, I will get accepted, I will fit in, people want to connect with me, I will be respected, now there's another possibility, sometimes a narcissist parent, and a nabler parent will cast the roles for the children, so it's not necessarily the children adapting, but it's the children being put in a role and expected to perform that role, and so the father could see a talented child, and make him that child his hero, that child has a great report card, let's show them off, that child is athletic, let's put them on display, and so this is their trophy of how good he must be as a dad to have this wonderful child who's so capable, it's a reflection on him is what he wants it to be, or he could have a child who's just, his buddy, he likes the same things as him, so dad likes football and other sports, this kid loves sports as well, dad loves fishing and hunting, this kid loves fishing and hunting, so this one becomes dad's buddy, and he's stuck in that role, and then another one might be dad's little princess, the pretty cute, always agreeable child that dad just loves to show off because of their beauty and how pleasant their personality is, so what a child has with that is if I stay in this role and do it well, I will get lots of validation, and so they learn that well, they try to convince themselves that it's them, but often sadly it's not the real them, it's not what they would naturally want to do or be, and so they are getting validated for performing, not for who they are, which often deepens shame, I hope that helps you understand how complex trauma contributes to the need to wear masks, now there's three kind of categories of masks, and so the one would be task-oriented masks, where you are an accomplisher, task-driven, the second one would be people-oriented, all of your masks are about social interaction, being friendly with people, and then there's a third category of masks, and that's the people who have the masks that we would call destructive or negative, or self-harm type masks, so you are angry all the time, you are harsh, you are intimidating, you are a risk-taker, all of those things, that is how you survive in your world, and that's the mask that you adopt, so what I want to do is take you through just a smattering of different types of masks that people adopt, it's no, by no means a comprehensive list, but maybe it will help you just think through what mask you have worn in your life, so there's the perfectionist, and that's the one who does everything perfectly, and so they think it's going to get them respect because they do everything perfectly, but deep inside they are always focusing on what they did not do perfectly, and it feeds their shame even more, and causes more fear and anxiety, then you have the superhero who's always competent, who's always helping out, who's always rescuing people, problem is often underneath, they feel so inadequate, and if they run into situations where they cannot be superhero four, it makes them feel even more inadequate, and then there's the ones that are just the expert, they are very smart, they read widely, they know lots of trivia, lots of information, and so they get their prestige by always having answers for people, and that's their mask, then the soloist, and this is the person who people look at and go, wow they are so self-sufficient, they can do almost anything, they are a jack of all trades, they do not need any help ever, wow I wish I had that strength, I wish I had that ability to just be able to do everything alone, sadly for many of these people they can never ask for help, because that would expose weakness, and so they stay in this isolated place where they have to be totally self-sufficient, but underneath they feel that they are not cutting it, and then the rescuer who's always there to help, and then there's the rescuer who's always there to help people and trouble, people who are hurting, people who are sick, and so they are just the empathetic person that's rushing in to help them do what they need done, and then a bunch of just very quickly the social butterfly, so this person just flits around like a butterfly at social gatherings, talking to everybody, it's all very superficial but it's very light, it's fluffy, it's fun, that's what they are good at, the comedian we have talked about has always got a joke, an interesting twist that makes things funny, a great storyteller, and then there's the cool guy with ice in his veins, nothing seems to bother them, they are just always under control, and then the martyr, the person who's always making sacrifices, and they talk about all the things they have done, and the hardship they have been through to help others, and that's their identity, and then the bad boy who just, he's just going to break rules, that's going to be who he is, he's not going to fit into any social norms or customs, he has to be outside of the norms in order to be himself, he thinks, and then prim and proper, the person who cannot go out in public unless every hair is in place, and they have all the social etiquette down to a science so that everything is done perfectly in social settings, in relationships, and then the stoic, the person who never shows any emotion, the person who's unruffled, the person who can be going through a crisis, and there's still nothing showing on their face, very stoic, then you get that very hard person, their eyes look cold, their eyes almost look dead, dark, and that's that hard shell that you see, and then the coy, flirtatious person who's always drawing attention to their body, their sexuality, and flirting with people, and then like I said, the chameleon, you just fit whatever you need to be in that situation in order to get people to like you, so you could add your own, and I think it might be a good exercise for you to just make a list of the things that you have done as masks to try to get those six competing priorities met in your life, but what are the results of wearing masks?  It seems to work, it keeps the child somewhat safe, it lets them survive in an unhealthy, unsafe situation, but what are the long-term consequences?  It does not solve the problem, your inner critic knows that you are an imposter, and it's constantly telling you that you are fake, that that's not the real you, that if people knew the real you, they would abandon you or abuse you or neglect you, and so wearing masks always feed shame.  It makes shame even worse, and that is that very sad core identity that is the root of so much that comes out of complex trauma.

The next thing is that you can wear masks forever, but you get to be a certain age where you want to stop, so you could be 40, 50, 60, and you say, I am done with this, and then you go, who am I?  I do not know what I like, I do not know what I am good at, because I have always just worn masks and performed, and then as long as you are wearing masks, you can have fake connection with people, but you cannot have true connection, because true connection requires authenticity, and so the very things you were trying to get, connection, respect to fit in, now has disappeared in the long run because of masks, so the very thing you are trying to get, you are actually preventing from happening, and that is to me such a sad thing.  So Brunei Brown, who's done a lot of work in this area, says this, if you trade your authenticity for safety, you may experience the following, anxiety, depression, eating disorders, addiction, rage, blame, resentment, and inexplicable grief.  In other words, in the long run, everything that comes out of wearing masks leads to pain, it leads to making things worse.  So let me talk about how do we change, how do we get healthy?  Number one, do not beat yourself up that you wore masks, you had to wear masks to survive, so do not beat up that little child for trying to survive, but understand that you are not going to stop wearing masks until your shame is starting to heal.  So begin working on your shame, and we have got a whole series on shame, and what that means is accept yourself, accept the parts of yourself that you used to want to hide, that you thought led to your needs not being met, that led to you being rejected or abused, you accept that, and that starts a healing process, but understand this, you can only stop wearing masks, heal your shame, become authentic if you are with safe people.  As soon as you are with unsafe people, authenticity cannot, it's something that might not be safe, it might get you hurt, and you might have to go back to masks, so you need safe people around you if you want to begin to change.  Somebody that says this, healing our relationship to ourselves, which is what this is about, is the first step towards leading an authentic life, we have to accept ourselves, we have to accept that little us that we despise when we were younger, it's the bedrock of our true potential.  Now let me read you a couple quotes from Bernabé Brown.  Authenticity is the daily practice of letting go of who we think we are supposed to be, and instead embracing who we are.  Another one, authenticity is a collection of choices we have to make each and every day.  It's about the choice to show up and be real.  Another one, true belonging is the spiritual practice of believing in and belonging to yourself so deeply that you can share your most authentic self with the world and find sacredness in both being a part of something and standing alone in the wilderness.  True belonging does not require you to change who you are, it requires you to be who you are.  Another one, because true belonging only happens when we present our authentic imperfect selves to the world, our sense of belonging can never be greater than our level of self-acceptance.  So again, self-acceptance, definition of authenticity.  What happens when your love of truth becomes more important to you than what others think?  So you have to accept yourself and want your true self more than you want what others think of you to be your deciding thing in life.  Robert Amon said this, one, authentic self is the meaning or value you put on yourself as a person.  So you cannot be expecting everybody else to put value on you, you start by doing it yourself.  And that means whether or not you are satisfied with yourself and not that you are trying to satisfy everybody around you.  You want to be real and satisfied with yourself.  Okay, so let's go back to this healing.  We want to become authentic.  That means finding safe people.  So let's say you find somebody that you think is safe.  Now take the risk.  And that means you are going to say I am going to reveal a little bit of myself to them.

But as soon as you think of that, you are going to feel fear.  So you get to walk through fear and reveal a bit.

Now, to be totally authentic does not mean you tell them everything about yourself all at once.  To be totally authentic means I am only going to show you a little bit of myself to see if you are a safe person, to see if I can trust that you will handle it correctly.  If you do, then I will reveal a bit more.  So reveal, be authentic, but reveal yourself gradually.  That is what I want you to see.

Another thing that's really important to understand is if you go back and look at the mass that you wore as a child, they probably were a blend of who you really are your personality plus what you learn to do to perform.

But there was a part of the real you there.  And so part of your journey today is figuring out okay, that was my mass which part is the real me which part was fake.

But hang on to the part that was the real you.  And then begin this journey of getting to know yourself.  And so act like a fly on the wall at times watching yourself.  And as you go through different things in the day, go, why did I do that?  Be curious about your motivation, your talents, the way you talk to people and then get to know yourself.  It's part of the journey.  Now just something that might be of interest to you.  I have a lot of people that say to me, I am very authentic.  And what that actually means is when they meet people, they tell them freely about themselves.  So I usually ask them, okay, you tell them information, but do you reveal all your emotions?  And they stop and they go, no, I am always happy.  So I go, you are authentic with information, but you are not yet authentic by being feeling safe enough to reveal all your emotions.  So authenticity has an information aspect, but it also has a revelation of my emotional world and values.  And so that goes to the next one.  Start exploring your values and beliefs.  You knew what dad believed, but what do you believe?  Start thinking about dad.  Then what do I really enjoy?  I know what they had me do and validated me for, but what lights my fire?  What do I get passionate about?  So try different activities and explore hobbies and different recreation to find out your passion.  And then something very practical that you can do is you may all have dressed the way that you were kind of told you had to dress to fit in, try dressing the way you want.  See what happens.

Another thing that you may probably have done is that when you start a relationship with somebody, you are afraid they are going to reject you.  So you let them take the lead and say when they say, what do you want to do tonight?  You go, whatever you want to do.  What do you want for supper?  Whatever you want for supper.  Why do not you say, here's what I would like to do tonight.  Risk being authentic, risk putting yourself out there.  And then take the risk of expressing your beliefs with somebody that are deeper beliefs than just superficial things.  Now always pay attention to times when you are tempted to put your mask back on.  And when you are tempted, ask yourself, what's going on here?  Why am I reverting to putting masks on again and go digging to find out what is the fear that is causing me to do this and then learn from that and grow.  Being authentic is what this is all about versus wearing masks.  Being authentic is the goal, the desire of everybody that comes into the world, complex trauma strips that away.  So getting healthy is returning to being authentic, which is starting to drop the mask.  And that creates fear that if people see the real me, they are going to reject me.  That's the lie you have believed for years.  So you are fighting lies, you are fighting fears.  And I hope this has just helped you in that journey.  That's the end of part one.  We are going to take a short break and then I am going to come right back and do part two, which is the Christian part.  And if you are not interested in that, we are not offended.  You are free to go.  Thank you for everybody else.  I will be back in a minute.  Well, welcome back for the Christian part.  I decided I wanted to take a little break from Peter today because there's been some stuff on my mind and it ties in with being authentic what we just talked about.

I want to take you back to the very first chapter of the Bible, Genesis 1.  So in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and then it goes through day one, he created this, day two, he created this.  And then when it gets to day six, it says then God said let us make human beings in our image to be like us.  So you notice us, our, us, plural.  And what that is hinting at right in the very first chapter of the Bible is that God is made up of more than one person and we have come to call it the Trinity, the three in one father, son, spirit.

But what I want you to understand is God is made up of a Trinity of people.  Now why is that?  Well, let me take you to first Timothy 6 and this kind of repeats what is said in other places in the Bible, but it says the blessed and only Almighty God, the King of all kings and Lord of all lords.  The blessed, that word means eternally happy, total joy, zero, sadness, pain, emptiness.  So what I think the Bible is showing us right up front is God as three one is the most happy beings in the entire universe and the reason they are happy is because they are totally connected.  They agree on everything.  They are in sync on everything.  They communicate at all levels freely.  And so it is saying look at God.  The reason for his total happiness is because it's total connection, total authenticity.  And what we emphasize over and over is true connection comes from true authenticity.  And that is what God is showing us.  The first thing in the Bible, God says I want to make humans like us.  And that means I want them to be connected so they can experience our joy, our blessed state.  It comes out of connection.  And so the greatest happiness does not come from drugs and alcohol, does not come from playing sports.  The greatest happiness comes from true connection, but true connection can only take place when you are authentic with a safe person who loves you unconditionally.  Then you will have true happiness.  Now as you follow through the Bible, you begin to notice things.  The first thing is death enters and why is death so painful?  Because it breaks the connection.  And then you have this concept of sin against God and against each other, hurting each other, hurting God.  Why is that such a serious thing?  Because it breaks the connection.  So the Bible is all about the connection of relationships, both horizontal and vertical, and the things that break that connection.  And that's the stuff it says is bad stuff.  Because once you break connection, joy disappears.  And so connection becomes critical.  This past Friday, the staff here in Winnipeg had a going away party for Kim and I.  So after 33 years of being in Winnipeg, we are moving to southern Ontario to Windsor and they had a going away thing for us and they showed a video and it had a lot of the graduations of react clients.  And as I watched the video, many of the clients, I immediately just, my heart was worn when I saw their picture on the screen.  I remembered them doing well and they are still doing well.  We have a connection.

But then I realized there were some people I recognized their face, but I could not remember their name.  And then there were other people I did not even remember that they had attended react.  And I go, what's that all about?  And I started thinking about it.  Here's what I put together.  The ones that I remembered were the ones that I connected with.  The ones that I connected with, it was not about me, it was about here's a client who was willing to take down his walls, take down his office mice and be risk being authentic and opening up and allowing others in.  Those are the ones that did well in the program and are still doing well.  They got connected and they have stayed connected.  The ones I did not even remember are the ones I tried to connect with, but they were not going to let me in.  They were not going to take down their walls.  They were not going to take off their mice.  And those are the ones that I could not remember and many have relapsed.  And it just stood out to me like, wow, in recovery, if you do not get connection, if you do not risk taking down the walls and taking off the mice, your chances of succeeding go way down.  Connection is vital.  That took me in a different direction in my thinking.  And I am going to share a little bit of my story with you.  Some of you may find it weird, but stick with me and I will make a point at the end.  As I look back at my childhood in my teen years, I never once rebelled.  I had zero interest in rebelling.  I never once smoked a cigarette, drank alcohol, tried pot or any drugs.  Never went to a party, did not interest me.  And I thought, why was that?  And the answer is loud and clear in my thinking, and it's because I felt so connected at home.  That's where I fit in.  That's where my needs were met.  That's where I was loved and valued.  That fitting in out there was not much of an attraction to me because I already fit in.  And that was a lot to do with my mom.  My dad more so in my teens, but in my early years, my mom.  And so because I would come home and connect every day with my mom, I had no desire to try and connect fit in out there.  Now you have to understand something.  As I look back on my life and my childhood, I realized, wow, I was an odd duck.  I did not think like other kids.  I did not like talking about the things other kids talked about.  There was something in me that operated at a deeper level.  And that made me kind of odd.  I got thinking, what would be like for my mom and dad to raise odd duck me?  And I go, it would have been really challenging.

But here's what I want you to understand.  It would have been very easy if I had been raised in a different home where parents would have tried to change me and make me something I am not, where they would have criticized me for the type of thinking and pursuits that I had as a young kid.

But the beauty is that my mom accepted me.  My dad accepted me.  My mom figured out how to connect with her odd duck son.  My mom figured out my love language and loved me with that language.  I was a challenge to fit in.

But they figured out how to do it.  They did not try to change me.  They adapted to me to connect with me.  That was what caused me to feel connected.  This is my home.  I do not need to find a home out there.  Now let me take it to the next part because you might be going, why is this guy in addiction treatment world?  And trauma sounds like it was a pretty good place for him.  Hang in there.  I will get it to it.

But I want you to understand it was a good place.

But it gave me a core that I built the rest of my life on.  So when I left home when the university started working, I still did not fit in out there.  I still had my mom and dad.  I could chat to.

But I often now felt kind of without a home.  Then I got married and Kim and I started making our new home.

But what I want you to understand is during this time, I would go to churches.  And I would get involved in churches.  And I would try to connect in churches.  And sadly and very frustrating for me is I found I was not fitting in there.  People did not share at a deep, authentic, vulnerable level.  They were just talking superficial stuff.  And so I go, that's not feeling like a home to me.  And then I became a pastor.  And again, in a church environment, trying to create a home where people could be safe, vulnerable and authentic.  And I just found it was constantly fighting against this whole mindset that was very different.  And so I still felt without a home.  Just I had Kim.  And we had our three children.  And that was my home.

But I was not fitting in anywhere else.  And then I remember this first or second day I started as an addiction treatment counselor.  And I started in a group session.  And people started opening up.  And I asked questions that took them deeper.  I pointed things out that took them even deeper.  And they went there with me.  And they were authentic.  They cried.  They got upset.  And I go, I think I found a home.  And now I have the privilege of being a surrogate father in this home to help people know they can be safe here and be authentic here.  And what I love so much about kind of one of the outcomes of addiction and trauma is it makes you dissatisfied with the superficial world.  It makes you see through a lot of the lies of our culture.  And it brings you to a point where you ask the hard questions that nobody else is asking in our culture because of all the comforts and ease that they experience.

But they come to a place of pain, a place of a bottom.  And they start asking hard questions they want to understand themselves at a deep level.  And I connected.  And then we started a family.  And so what I want you to understand is connection is what God introduced first off when he created human beings.  He said, let us make them like us so they can connect.  And everything flows out of connection.  And all of the problems flow out of broken connection.  And healing is restored when we start connecting again.  Let's pray.  Father, thank you for connecting with us.  Thank you for making us as connecting beings.  And just help each person here to just begin to risk connection with safe people, risk authenticity with themselves, with you, with others.  And just bring the joy that comes out of connection to their lives I pray.  Amen.  Well, that's the end of our Friday night.  Thank you so much for being here with us.  I look forward to seeing you again next Friday.  Have a great weekend.
