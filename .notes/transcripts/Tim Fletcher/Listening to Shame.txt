What I want to look at tonight is to me one of the most painful sad results of complex trauma and I see it in every person I deal with that has experienced complex trauma and it is this complex trauma and I'll show how but complex trauma shapes how I see myself it shapes what I believe to be true about myself it shapes my self-identity and it is not a pleasant picture that gets shaped and that picture that we develop that self-identity picture begins to affect almost every single person that we see in our lives and that's what I want to look at tonight. I want to focus on everything we do negatively and that's what I want to focus on tonight and I just warn you up front is that this might stir up some painful stuff and I do it just so that you begin to make connections in your mind as to what has happened in you and that you're able to be honest with yourself and then hopefully with others about what you're really dealing with in your life and how you see yourself. So let me start with this how do we get a sense of who we are the common question that I hear addicts ask and people from complex trauma is I've never known who I am and I've always wondered who am I and and how does a child get a sense of identity so there's questions that every child asks on a subconscious level and it's hard to get a sense of who you are, so there's a lot of questions that every child asks on a subconscious level and it's hard to get a sense of who you are and so if you think about it, you've asked them too. So number one, we all come into the world asking, do I have any value? Do I matter to anybody? Do I make a difference in anybody's life? Do I have anything to offer to people around me? Do I have value? That is a huge question all of us have. The second one that is just as big is, am I lovable? Am I somebody that people would desire a relationship with? Am I somebody that is considered desirable? Massive questions in the heart of every child. What then happens in our lives that gives us the answers to those questions? So there's a couple of things. Number one, as much as we may not realize that we are affected by our culture in answering those questions. So as we look at Hollywood and culture advertising, what it is doing constantly is telling us, here is what makes a person valuable. Here is what makes a person lovable and desirable. And so every child growing up in our culture is getting this presentation from culture. If you want to be lovable, you need a perfect body. If you want to be lovable, you have to have certain characteristics about how you behave, about your money, about your position, about your possession. All of those things are subconsciously and overtly sent to our children and to all of us about what the standard is to be lovable and valuable. But beyond that, we have to have certain characteristics about how we behave. And beyond that, we then interpret how people treat me as answers to those questions. So if people treat me a certain way, I go, I guess I have value, or I guess I'm lovable. And then we pay attention to what people say to us. And what they say to us also answers those questions. So those three things begin to shape our self-identity. Now introduce complex trauma. And this has the most profound effect on what shapes a child's identity because what a child has got going on in their mind when they're being abused or neglected or their needs aren't being met or they're being abandoned is they're saying, this must be my fault. I must have done something or I must be not good enough. That is causing this treatment to be happening to me. Let me take that a little bit further to help you kind of get in your mind what begins to happen in a child's mind at a subconscious level. A child might say, because my dad is always too busy at work, that must mean I do not matter. Instead of saying dad's got a problem, the child says it means I don't have value or I must not be lovable. And if dad is always watching the TV when you want to talk or he kind of half listens while he works, you begin to get the message to you, I must be a bit of a burden to my dad. I must have something about me that causes me to be a burden where dad really, it's a chore for him to give me a burden. It's a chore for him to give me a burden. It's a chore for him to give me attention. I must be a bit of a pain. Do you get the what's happening there? You're starting to interpret dad's responses to you as being the truth about who you are. And it is all negative. You go beyond that and you say, as you get into your teen years, nobody is my friend right now. I don't have a boyfriend or I don't have a girlfriend. So I guess that proves nobody loves me. Which therefore proves that I'm not lovable. And you begin to interpret that. And then if you get bullied or laughed at or made fun of about stuff, then you're always starting to get the message, I'm really dumb. I'm really a pain. I am not a good person to be around. I must be incompetent. If people roll their eyes when you talk, if people laugh at you because they hurt you, or they encourage you wet your bed, or that you stutter, you all take all of those messages in and say, man, I am not a good person. And then when people respond to you when you fail, and it might be where you do something bad, but it might be that you're just a child, you wipe out on your bike or you spill your milk. And how do people respond? Do you? Do you? Do you? How do you respond to people when you fail? If they're laughing at you, if they're criticizing you, if they're getting angry at you, if they're calling you stupid, you'll never learn. You can't do anything right. You're interpreting all of that and you're taking it in and saying, that must be the truth. And so the picture that slowly develops from thousands and thousands of responses and verbal messages, is, I am not good enough. I am not a valuable person because nobody wants to take time for me. I am not a lovable person. I am not a desirable person. I feel less than and inferior to others. I feel like I'm a burden and a pain. And that becomes your internal picture. And my guess is that almost everybody here, that those were the messages that you got. And whether you are honest with yourself about it or not, if you stop and think about it, you know that feeling. It's there. You've lived with it. We call that, kind of in technical terminology, shame. And I'm not talking about, oh, you should be ashamed of yourself. Shame is that core belief about my identity. It's a core belief about who I am in terms of value and being lovable and being worthwhile. And shame is a negative belief that I'm not good enough and that I'm not lovable and that I am a burden. And that core belief is what comes out of childhood trauma. And that core belief, what we're going to see, begins to shape and affect everything you do. How you cope, how you relate to other people. It is like this massive earthquake takes place and it just starts going out into all corners of your life. Now let me give you two things to think about in regards to this. Number one, that core belief of shame is actually distortions. You were given lies. You were given stuff about you and how people treated you, responded to you and what they said to you that isn't the truth about you. But you believe the distortion. So you need to understand that up front. But secondly, I want you to understand how difficult and how deep this goes and how difficult it is to deal with. I don't know if you've ever been into like the Red River Acts or Disney World where they have the House of Mirrors. With a little bit of a twist. With all the distorted mirrors. And so let's say that you're six feet tall and you're very skinny. Okay? And you walk into a House of Mirrors and there's a mirror there that makes you look four feet tall and four feet wide. Okay? And you look at that and you laugh and go, wow, that is amazing to be that way. Now just imagine this. Imagine you're six feet tall and skinny but you grow up in a home where there's only one mirror. And that one mirror is a mirror. And that one mirror shows you to be four feet tall and four feet wide. And that's the only mirror you're ever allowed to look at. So every day when you wake up and throughout the day when you pass by that mirror, what is reflected back to you is a kid who's four feet tall and four feet wide. Imagine that's every day. What would happen when you got to be 18 and you moved away from home. Imagine you went into a home where there was an accurate mirror that showed you to be six feet tall and skinny. You go, there's something wrong with that mirror. You wouldn't say, wow, that mirror I had growing up is screwed up. You go, no, that mirror I had growing up was the truth. That mirror there on that wall that says I'm six feet tall, that's crazy. You want to know what happens if people were to come to you if you've had this distorted mirror that gives you the message of, shit, I'm six feet tall. That's crazy. That'sahr кл tadi glaghetti ce� Raphaelake this is everything you'd realize because the mirror acceptable? This is the absolute truth. It's what's unknown. And theBar This is not the image that goes straight into the eye. It's beyond3000.' The street is so many days of not being able to adjust. Many people think I don't say it. That's true by a Howard Rodman as they kill life in Africa. But I know the word from mankind Maybe as much as I wanted to say, I was a D法 this is all my Second Age. No one says I who chose what they wanted to do, they knew symbolically ab침 van myiana Please, tell me parts of me. No one says I thought Michael thePorch snagged me. thing or some of you would go wonder what they want they're working me that's why they're being nice here they've got a secret agenda and so you could not accept compliments from people why because your shame mirror said you do not deserve compliments you are not a good person you are not a lovable valuable person and so when somebody says that to you it's like that mirror that says you're six feet tall and skinny you go something's wrong with that mirror that's how big this issue is and that's how hard it is to deal with it so let's look at how we respond to shame after complex trauma creates the shame last week we said that with complex trauma the first priority is to treat the trauma as a tool to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem we have to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem and to deal with the problem is i never want to get hurt again the second priority that comes now with shame is i must hide who i am because if other people see the real me which all these me this these mirrors in my family have been giving to me if they see that person that's not lovable and not valuable they'll reject me and abandon me and they'll abuse me as well so i have to hide i have to hide and so priority two becomes hiding and you do a lot of different things in order to hide and and some you will do that i am not going to include on this list but let me give you some of the things that we do to hide that person that we are ashamed of and want nothing to do with first is we will go into isolation and isolation can be geographical and that is i'm not hang around people because if I hang around people they might see me and I can't risk that so I'm going to hide by being a turtle and I'm going to go away and not be around people then the second way of hiding is I'm going to hide behind walls and you might say I never hide because I'm a social person I love being around people and what I might would say to you if you have shame is you're probably hiding behind walls you're not going to let anybody get close you might be the life of the party you might talk to everybody and talk their leg off but nobody's getting close to you to see the real you and so for some people they use humor to do that that is a big thing and then the next thing that we do is that we wear masks we put on if we're with a certain group of people and they're all uppity upsies and they're all like oh my god what's up with you and they're all like oh my god what's up with you and they're all like oh my god what's up with you and they're snooty types we act all uppity up snooty type if we're down with kind of people that are really rough and tumble then we're acting that way and we switch masks to fit in so that we'll get accepted but it's not the real us it's an act we get good at playing roles and some people actually become chameleons and the chameleon is put it in a black environment it changes its color to black put it in a green environment it changes its color to black and then we come back to be chameleons and environment, all of a sudden it changes to green. I will be whatever you want me to be, just don't reject me and don't find out what I'm really like. Stop and think about kind of how that works. What happens is it looks like it's working. You're wearing these masks, people seem to be accepting you, people seem to like you, but what's going on in your head? Well, they're accepting me because I'm wearing a mask. If they knew the real me, they wouldn't accept me. So what have you solved? Nothing. But what have you actually done is not just that you haven't solved anything, you've actually made it worse because now you've got more insecurity because these people like me. What happens if they see through my mask? Oh my goodness, now you're getting anxiety, you're starting to panic, and that is what begins to happen. Next way that people hide is to create an image, and this is tied into the mask, but it's for some people is that you will create in public a perfect family. And I don't know if you were raised in this, but you could all be swearing at each other and hitting each other, but then it was time to go to church or it's time to go out for a social thing, and everybody had to get their dress and their best clothes on, and every hair had to get licked into place, and you got worn to be on your best behavior, and you walked out and you're smiling at each other and hugging each other and acting like this perfect family, and it's wow, this is really a good family. The minute you're back inside the house and the doors are shut, all that's gone. Now here's what happens with a lot of people, and this is a big issue if you're in recovery. If you're very smart and very talented, you're able to create an image of success quite easily. And so you could be saying, I am going to be the most successful kid because I'm going to use my brains and my abilities, and you get a good job. You can afford a nice house and a nice car, and you start to get all the symbols of success in place, and you act the part. You're good at acting like you got your act together. And then addiction takes you out or relationships break down, and you start to see that you're in a good relationship with your partner, and you start to see that you're in a good relationship with your partner, and you start to see that you're in a good relationship with your partner, and you start to go through a divorce. And so what is going on there? When you are creating an image, it's not the real you. It's a phony facade like a house of cards. And what you're doing is, I can't change the inside because I have so much damage. I am not lovable. I am not valuable. Whatever I do, so I will try to fix my problem by the external world. I can't fix my internal world. I will try to fix my external world. And many of you have done that, and you have pulled it off for a lot of years, and then crash. There's a chink in your armor, and a house of cards come falling down. And that's where I say to people that that can be when addiction is a blessing. Because it exposes the truth that you can no longer avoid. And you can no longer just rebuild your house of cards. Now, I want to add something. What happens to a lot of addicts in recovery is, I go into a treatment center, and what you're thinking is, please give me information so that I can maintain my image better. So I can be more successful at maintaining my image. And what I say to them, no, I won't give you information to do a better job on keeping your image. So I can be more successful at maintaining my image. And what I say to them, no, I won't give you information to do a better job on keeping your image.

What I say to them, no, I won't give you information to do a better job on keeping your image. the minute you get into the car the radio goes on or you're texting when you shouldn't be and all of that kind of stuff and then you're on the phone and you get home the TV's on you're playing video games and if you have to sit there your legs just the bouncing because you can't your antsy you can't live with yourself and so you need constant distractions because living in your own skin is terrible existence okay that's how we the first thing their second priority is to hide now the what we do from there is this nobody wants to walk around feeling like they don't have any value there's something in us that is driven to I want to feel valuable I want to feel that I have importance so we begin to try and create things that give us a sense of feeling important and everybody's different in what they do but let me give you some of the things that people do to try to deal with their shame and try to feel value if you were born to be one of those people that just naturally has a very beautiful face and a very beautiful body you probably if you're a girl you're probably in school had a lot of guys asking you out for dates a lot of guys drooling over you and and and you're looking around and saying nobody else is getting this kind of attention huh I'm pretty hot well that just makes me feel valuable so now what has happened in your mind is my value does not come from Who I am or my character my value comes from my body and my looks and so now what do you have an obsession about I have to maintain this body and then when you get 40 and 50 you're having major crises because it's getting harder to do all the nips and tucks and maintain the body the thing that gave you value is disappearing but you see how that works some go well I might not have as hot a body as Miss hottie over there but I can get more guys to sleep with me than she can and I'm better in bed and so I'm going to use my promiscuity my ability in bed to start keeping track that I've got more people that I've slept with and I am hotter in bed that's my value and if you grow with that and all of a sudden you come into recovery and you go I think I need to change a lot of my sexual behavior that's a crisis because now you're going well then what will give me value because that was the source of my value huge issue some you just get the money and the possessions and you use that to get a lot of money and you could have give you a sense of value or your position your career that becomes what gives you a sense of value and that if that's the case for you that's why retirement is a huge crisis for somebody because now they're not working and that's what gave them value and so now who are they they weren't a human being before they were a human doing and now that they're not doing they don't have a sense of value a big issue some people get into religion and they're going to be the best person in that religion and they'll get their value from that others are say you know I can't compete in any of those arenas I don't stand a chance but man I can be bad so I'm gonna be the baddest of the bad and that will give me my sense of value but you want to know what happens when you go down that road of finding value it seems to be working but it always leaves you having to prove yourself every time a new person moves into the school that's good looking all of a sudden you're I got to prove that I'm hotter than them and you got all of that and so you got insecurities start to happen jealousy all of those things it does not properly solve the value issue it does not properly solve the shame problem the next thing that some people do to try and get a sense of value is to go into relationships but the problem is is that shame always messes up those relationships so let me we're gonna save this to go into detail in a couple weeks but let me just mention it very briefly a person in shame the worst thing to be is alone because if I'm all alone without being in a relationship well that seems to prove I'm not lovable nobody wants to be with me and so therefore the goal becomes I always have to be in a relationship and some of you understand that and if a relationship starting to fall apart you won't end it till you got another one ready to go so you can move from one to the other and so that becomes a very important thing I have to be in a relationship that proves and confirms I'm desirable and I'm not lovable and I'm lovable others what happens because of the shame is I long for intimacy but I'm scared of intimacy if I take this wall down and I let them in to start to know me I'm pretty sure they're going to abandon me and so you want to have an intimate relationship but you're afraid to you live with a fear that they're going to leave you and so that fear of abandonment causes you all kinds of games that you play in order to try and stop that or test them and then it causes all kinds of jealousy because what you're thinking is once they find out what I'm really like they're going to find somebody else because bottom line you feel you're not much of a catch where I like to put it this way you feel like you're chopped liver and I think we all have in success you always have a chance to shock yourself but I mean you do and it's in our character to move and things matter there is no doubt it do you know it usually it doesn't help if they only taken a beating it does it help if it makes you balls a bunch of makeup媽 and you know who this guy has was my Nearly two years something to flour go and say I'm sick I'm sick I'm dislocated but it's okay eventually we'll get better yes but you've got to come back to yourself to understand you understand women when you voltage young for good now we see it's more self-reliant to love to control them so they don't leave you for that steak and and it gets really messy and it begins to break the relationship down the other thing that happens is when you have shame you always end up feeling inferior and so you're thinking is if I could just feel superior then that would be the answer to my shame and so most relationships of people with shame are people who are always inferior superior somebody's always trying to be better than the other and you want to know something you cannot have a healthy intimate relationship if those are the dynamics and we'll look at that in more detail and so the sad result of all of the shame is it messes up relationship but what is interesting and I still don't know that we have a perfect way of explaining it but a shame person always seems to attract other shame people some people will say to me all the time why do I always attract losers then they're beautiful people in many ways but it's because there's shame and a person with shame is an antennas out there that says oh I can smell another person with shame and I know the dynamics for how that those relationship work and then before you know it you're in a relationship that starts out like it's the most wonderful relationship in the world because you both have got masks on and as soon as those masks are coming off and the real person comes out it's World War three and it's not a pretty sight okay let me end with this how do you begin to heal from shame it's one thing to understand it to analyze the problem but where do you go to start to change that my hope for everybody here if you grew up with a distorted mirror that said you're four feet tall and four feet wide is that someday you can look at an accurate mirror that says you're six feet tall and thin and say that's the truth I believe it but that is a journey to get there and so let me just say this there's a couple basics I'm not going to expand on it I'm just gonna give them to you quickly but number one hang around healthier people who will be more accurate mirrors that will reflect to you and a more accurate picture about your value and how lovable you are here's why I emphasize that what happens for many people in recovery is they're afraid to make new relationships with people so they go back to old friends or they go back to unhealthy family and you want to know what going back to unhealthy family is it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's not healthy family it's going back to a distorted mirror and so you could be in treatment I've seen this happen over and over where you're starting to feel better about yourself you're starting to heal from your shame and you go home to visit family and mum raises an eyebrow and makes a comment and all of a sudden you feel like that person has no value and is a pain and a burden and not good enough it all comes rushing back and so you need to begin to think about putting up to heal and then starting to revive and try to make the choices that are important to Бойти Lavender. boundaries with people who aren't healthy mirrors in your life. And I just add that for many people, the spiritual relationship is an important piece in healing at this level of starting to get the proper messages about who I am. The next thing is you have to start on a journey that says, okay, I received a whole lot of distorted messages. Some of them might have a little bit of truth about who I am, but much of it was lies. And I need to begin to sort out what is the lie that I was told about me? What are the tapes that play in my head that say I'll never amount to anything? I need to identify the lies in there and begin to replace it with the truth. And that is a journey and it is a journey. A slow but steady progress type of journey. The next thing is maintain a clear conscience. You want to know what happened when you're feeling really good about yourself and you're starting to say, I like me a little bit. And then you do something that you really hurt somebody else and your conscience is eating you up. It brings all the shame feelings back. So you need to keep doing that stuff that keeps that conscience clear and you're dealing with the truth. You're dealing with the truth and you're dealing with the damage that you've done in the lives of others. And then there's value in serving because as you begin to help in various ways, you begin to learn where you have value. You begin to learn. I'm really good at helping people in that way. I'm terrible in this way. But you begin learning where your strengths are. And then the next thing that I think is absolutely essential is you need to talk about your shame stuff with people and with your friends and your family. And I'll give you a few examples of people who are safe. People who will accept you. The fear is if I talk about this, these people are going to make fun of me. They're going to judge me. They're not going to want anything to do with me. You want to know what usually happens though? When you get honest about how you really feel, people appreciate it. People say, now I want to be your friend because you're real. And I want that kind of a friendship. That's territory don't just go up to somebody and say Tim said I need to start talking about it so sit down I'm gonna barf all over you for the next two hours probably not wise go gradual okay so the final thing is be patient with yourself when you received if you think about it probably millions of shame messages growing up you don't undo all of that in a day you don't undo it in a week it is a journey and you might have made a whole bunch of healing and really really grown and ten years from now you walk into a situation and something about that triggers something from your childhood that brings stuff back and you want to say oh I haven't learned a thing no you've learned lots you just now have a new thing that has come up that you can grow and heal a little bit more in let me end with this if what I've said tonight has caused you to realize something maybe there's a lot of pain happening inside please be honest with somebody about how you're feeling and possibly some of you are hearing this and there's one voice in this year saying yep that's the truth and there's another voice saying I don't want to go there I don't want to go there let's whistle a tune so I don't have to listen I hope you can get honest it might feel like you're dying when you get honest about this but actually it's the path to actually beginning to feel alive let's just pray father such a important but painful difficult topic but so much damage comes out of it and I just pray you'd help each person tonight where they're at amen
