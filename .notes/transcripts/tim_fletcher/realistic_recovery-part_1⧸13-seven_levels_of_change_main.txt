Tonight we're starting a new series.

And what I want to look at is what does recovery look like realistically?

And over the years I've dealt with many clients who come into recovery and they have all these unrealistic expectations about what recovery is going to be like.

They think there's a magic bullet somewhere, they just got to find it, and then they'll be magically cured.

They think it'll be easy.

They think they'll just do certain steps, they'll be fixed and never struggle again, and on and on and on it goes.

And so part of what I do, and it's not always the fun part, but I have to try to paint a realistic picture of recovery, and it's a lot of work.

I don't know much in life that requires more work than recovery and dealing with trauma, but I say that not to discourage you because I think there's a ton of hope.

And there's a lot of hope.

There's a lot of hope if people will do what they need to do.

So one of the things I want to do is come at this recovery topic from a whole bunch of different directions.

So that each week you'll get a little different part of recovery and hopefully understand it just a little bit better.

So that gradually a bit of a roadmap will come into play in your mind, and the encouragement and hope that you'll have to be able to do that.

And I think that's what I'm going to do.

And I'm going to do it in a way that's going to help you to begin this journey, which I think is well worth the effort.

So tonight I want to come at it from a perspective that talks about seven levels of change that are required in recovery.

And I do this because a lot of people come in and think they only got to change one thing, and then they're going to be okay.

So these levels basically are going to go in the order that I'm going to present them, but they don't necessarily have to go in that order.

But you're going to find it's kind of like layers of an onion.

You get through one layer, then you get to the next and the next, and it just gets deeper and deeper.

So that each layer takes you to a more difficult part than the one before.

And eventually you get down to the core.

So we're going to start on the outside and work our way to the core.

And it'll give you a great big picture of about what is involved in needing to be changed in recovery.

So the first one is you can't get recovery unless you have some abstinence.

And that's the first goal is to be able to stay clean and sober.

Now I always feel the need to add this.

People who are really serious about recovery, they do have relapse.

They do have relapse.

That doesn't mean they go back to zero, that they didn't learn anything, that they messed up and nothing was accomplished.

What my goal when a person relapses is what can we learn from it so we don't repeat it.

So as you work towards abstinence, you might have some slips here and there.

Don't see that as a total failure or the end of the world or you can't do this.

See it as an opportunity to learn so that you have a greater probability of getting this abstinence.

So you can learn some stuff, but what you're going to find is this.

If you keep slipping, you're only going to grow to a certain point then stop.

So the abstinence does become important at some time if you want to continue the healing, growing, and recovery.

So you're going to start to realize that you have to change situations in your life.

And what I mean by that is this.

Your old life, party life, spending time with buddies at the bar, doing the things that you did with using friends, that's got to change.

Most people realize they can't continue to go to bars and parties and expect to stay clean and sober.

They have to change.

They have to begin to develop new situations, new circumstances, new locations, new people.

They got to replace the old stuff with new.

And for many people that is a huge change.

Because it's like everything you used to do, you can't do anymore.

You have to now start to replace it with new activities in new locations, with new groups of people.

And that can be an overwhelming feeling type of change because it's like everything is going to change.

But that's only layer two.

The next one we get into are behavior changes.

We teach all the time that relapse is a process as well as an event.

So the event is when you pick up.

The process is the behavior.

The behaviors before the event that fall like dominoes.

So you could have, let's say somebody really pisses you off.

And all of a sudden your anger goes where your anger goes.

Then the dominoes start falling.

So next you could go and you could become super negative, criticize everything, find fault with everything.

Then you have self-pity.

You go on the pity pot and have a little party.

Then you start to isolate.

And then you start to lie.

And then you start hanging around with old friends or checking them out on Facebook.

And then you pick up.

So it didn't just happen in a day.

It was a process.

And so what you begin to realize is I'm not just changing using to not using.

I'm changing lying to being honest.

Isolating to meaningful relationships.

Negative thinking to beginning to look at life accurately.

I have to change all kinds of behavior.

So that's another major overhaul for a lot of people.

Because if you spent your life in survival mode from complex trauma, that means you spent your life lying in order to survive.

You spent your life unknowingly.

You spent your life isolating in order to survive.

But now those very things that kept you safe from the trauma as a younger person, now those very things are leading you to a relapse.

And so you begin to realize I got to start changing from my old survival behaviors to new skills.

I got to learn new tools which include new behaviors.

And that is absolutely necessary in recovery.

So then the next layer is you got to start changing your thinking.

So I don't know if you ever thought about how much your brain affects whether you stay clean and sober or get healthy or not.

So a lot of things that you have in your brain that you might not even realize is you tell yourself lies all the time.

When you're stressed out, your brain says the truth about this situation is you need a holiday so let's relapse.

And you have to be able to say no that's not the truth even though it feels like it.

That's a lie.

And then when you make a mistake and you start saying I'm a loser, I can't do anything right, I might as well give up, it's useless.

You have to say whoa that's a lie.

And if I follow that lie and keep beating myself up, that takes me back into old behaviors and that takes me to a relapse.

So I have to begin identifying the lies that I believe about myself, about happiness, about life.

Because if I don't change those lies to the truth, I'm never going to make it.

Then the next thing that happens with people coming out of complex trauma is you have this, if you're old enough to remember, eight track tape.

You know you have to be really old to remember.

You have to remember that.

But they are continuous loops.

So you would get to the end of the tape and you didn't have to turn it over.

It would just go back to track one and start all over again.

Okay, so for your young people you can go check that out on Google and find out about it.

But here's what I want to say.

If you grew up in complex trauma where nobody had time for you, where you got abandoned, where you got criticized, where you got abused, you were made to feel that you were the problem.

And that you weren't good enough and that you weren't lovable.

And you were told things that were very hurtful.

And you put those in your brain in an eight track cassette tape and that plays now every time you do something.

And you go, you're useless, you can't do anything right, you'll never amount to anything, the world would be better off without you.

And you start playing the tapes.

And that you don't even have to think about consciously.

It just happens subconsciously.

But what I want you to realize is I've never seen anybody stay clean and sober who keeps playing those tapes.

Now what many people think is they're powerless to stop those tapes.

I want you to understand those tapes are powerful because they have been reinforced and reinforced for years.

But you are not a little child anymore.

You are a big person.

You are a big person who can say, no, I don't have to keep saying that to myself.

I can stop that tape.

I do have the power to do that.

And that can be huge.

Next thing that happens in your thinking is we develop unrealistic expectations about life, about recovery, about people.

We expect everybody to treat us perfectly.

We expect everybody we meet to be perfect.

We expect recovery to be a breeze.

You realize what you just set yourself up for?

To be mad all the time.

To feel sorry for yourself all the time.

To think life gave you a dirty deal all the time when it's your expectations that are out of whack.

And so you have to go and look at that.

And then our brain has a part that remembers the greatest moments of our life.

The greatest pleasure times.

So as soon as life starts getting a little rough in the here and now, that part of our brain goes back to the euphoric aspects of using a long time ago.

And it gets us starting to think about that and about how tough recovery is.

And it ignores the bottom that we were at.

It ignores all the damage and hurt we've done.

It just starts to make relapse sound like the best idea in the whole world.

And recovery the worst idea in the whole world.

So your brain, what I want you to see is, it has constant wars.

One part of your brain with another part.

They are fighting all the time.

One wants to do the right thing, the other wants to do the wrong thing.

And that's part of the battle is learning to deal with that stuff.

And then the last part of your brain is that good old limbic emotional part of your brain, the child brain that gets triggered by fear and anger and embarrassment and depression and all of those things.

And when it gets triggered, it just goes crazy with intensity and power.

And that messes up a lot of people.

So the fourth layer of this onion, you got to change a lot of behaviors.

You got to change a lot of stuff in your life and who you hang around with, what you do.

You got to change your thinking.

Next one.

This starts to get to the more painful part of what's got to be changed.

So I hope what you're seeing is you're changing your external world, but you're changing your internal world.

You're changing your external world about where you go, what you do.

But you're changing your thinking.

You're changing your emotions.

Every part of you has to change because every part of you has been affected by complex trauma and addiction.

So the emotions.

Letting yourself feel.

We just did a little series on painful emotions.

You have to learn how to identify your emotions and know what's going on inside of you.

You have to be able to start talking about your feelings and processing them.

And then learning how to deal with them is very important.

And then you have to catch yourself because you have this tendency subconsciously to start disconnecting from your feelings.

Because you don't like feeling.

And as soon as you start disconnecting, you usually end up making some bad decisions.

And then you have to realize that a lot of the decisions you make in life are based on how you're feeling.

You're stressed.

You're angry.

You're lonely.

You're depressed.

All of those set the dominoes falling.

And so I need to be aware that these have to be dealt with.

Even though emotions make life feel messy, if I don't deal with them, they will start the dominoes and I'll never get healthy or stay clean and sober.

So the emotional stage.

Next level.

Relationships.

So now we're back to our external world.

So we're intellectual beings.

We're physical beings.

We're emotional beings.

But we're relationship beings.

And I think one of the toughest parts of recovery for most people are the changes in this area.

That you have to begin to cut some people out of your life.

Hopefully not a whole lot, but there probably will be some that you have to cut out of your life.

Because to allow them to stay in your life is going to keep you sick.

And it will keep you never growing.

It'll keep you in all your pain.

That means then, you're going to have to learn to set boundaries with people.

And that's not easy, especially if you're afraid to say no to people.

Especially if you're afraid of people not liking you.

But you have to say, hey, I'm worth fighting for.

I'm worth investing in.

And I have to set some boundaries because these people aren't good for me.

Where I'm at right now, I am too vulnerable.

And I have to protect the fragile me.

Then, your families.

Some of you have supportive families.

Most of you don't.

And so most of you have to figure out how in the world do I have a relationship with my family that is either somewhat sick or toxic.

Because if I don't figure that out, they keep dragging me into their stuff.

And every time I get dragged into their stuff, I get messed up.

That is really hard, but it is so important.

And then, what you just did is cut out pretty much everybody in your life.

So now you're all alone going, now what?

Now you got to build some healthy friendships.

And you go, wow, that's too hard.

So you want to know what a lot of people do?

They go back to their family.

Because it's too hard to sit alone and have patience to build new friendships.

Let's just go back because I'm lonely.

And then they're messed up again.

And so part of recovery is realizing I have to sit in a bit of loneliness for now and then put my energy into starting to build healthy relationships.

And you don't get that overnight.

That's a bit of a journey that you have to do.

Now the next thing people do is go, okay, I'll get into healthy relationships.

Anybody want to date me?

Here's my phone number.

I'm available.

Now you've got all kinds of what you think are healthy relationships.

So be careful around the romantic relationships.

Because that's where people go when they're lonely if they can't go to family and they're tired of waiting of building friendships slowly.

And that'll mess you up big time.

And then you have to learn how to be a parent to your children in a healthy way.

And they're probably already affected by stuff that you've done.

They've got their own complex trauma.

And so part of your journey is learning how to help them with their stuff.

Keep working on your stuff.

Heal the damage that you've done.

And that takes a lot of learning.

And then we talk about lonely.

We didn't quite get to horny, but that's the part that we're getting to now.

Everybody in recovery, believe it or not, has to deal with their sex drive.

And it's loneliness will kill you or the horniness will.

And if you don't deal with it, you're messed up.

Okay.

So that's six done, number seven.

So you see, we've started on the outside and we've been working in.

And now the final one, which a lot of people don't see right away in recovery.

But what you're doing in recovery is looking at your deepest core beliefs.

And you're saying, what do I believe about happiness?

What do I believe will make for a satisfying life?

What do I believe about how life should operate as far as children, relationships, employment?

And you're going to your core.

And you're saying, have I been building my life on lies at a deep level?

So a lot of people say, happiness is being my own boss and doing whatever I want to do.

Well, you tried that.

And that wasn't happiness.

That ended up in misery.

You thought it was going to give you freedom.

It led you to become a captive to your dark side.

And so now at your very core, you got to say, I got to rethink life.

I got to rethink what makes this world work in a healthy way that leads to happiness.

Because I've been following the wrong roadmap.

And I got some deep thinking to do.

And then, you're really saying, I have to be willing to look at every piece of my life, everything I've built my life on.

Is it a reliable, strong foundation?

Or is it a weak foundation?

I got to look at my emotions, my thinking, my relationships, my behaviors, my friendships, all of that.

Or else I could be in trouble.

And I'm going to be in trouble.

And I'm going to be in trouble.

And I'm going to be in trouble.

So bottom line, You got to change everything.

If you hadn't figured that out yet, you're gone.

So that's why a lot of people say, this is too hard.

And I don't know if I want to do it.

So you got an option.

And it's called that fork in the road.

So down one road at the fork in the roads, it is, well, just relapse.

And you go, no, I know where that road ends up.

And then the other fork in the road, says I got to do hard work.

You know, I don't like that option either.

Is there a third road somewhere you're not telling me about?

But that's where you're stuck.

And so you can sit at that fork in the roads for a while.

But if you sit there too long, do you guess what road you automatically go down?

The relapse road.

And so at some point, you have to say, really, I don't have any viable option except to work.

Because nothing else works anymore.

So I might as well buckle down and do it.

And hopefully you'll do that.

And you'll find it very rewarding.

Now I got to add one thing.

Let's say you decide I want to change.

So I put that little diagram up there for you.

So picture yourself back in addiction.

So if addiction is a very strong addiction, so if addiction never got worse and worse and worse, you'd still be an addict.

And so what caused you to change as you were going along in your status quo of I'm an addict and I love it, is it got worse.

And it got very painful.

And pain makes us think, maybe I need to change something.

And so that's what pain did.

And so now people make changes and life gets better.

And they go, great.

This is fantastic.

I'm so glad I gave up drugs and alcohol and I'm living a clean life.

But they're not prepared for what happens next once you start to change.

And that's where it starts to feel like it's going downhill.

It starts to feel like your life is getting worse again.

So let me take you to some of the things that will begin to happen as you start to change.

So the first thing is, all of a sudden you're entering unknown.

Nobody told you how to live in this new way of life.

You've never been in this new way of life before.

And now you're going into unknown.

And what happens when your brain hits unknown?

It goes, uh-oh, something bad's going to happen.

It always does.

So let's just sabotage.

Because we're going to screw up anyways.

Then the next thing that happens, the more healthy you get, life has less and less chaos and drama.

And then you go, this is boring.

This recovery is dull.

So let's have a bit of excitement.

So let's sabotage that as well.

And then all of a sudden you're working with people who are 40 and they act like 40.

You're 40 and you act like 10.

And you're hanging out with people who are 40 and they act like 10.

And you're hanging out with them and all of a sudden you're embarrassed and self-conscious and insecure.

And you think, I bet you all these people just are judging me.

And they're thinking I'm a loser.

And they don't want a friendship with me.

Well, what's the point?

And you give up.

And then when you were in your chaos, at least you knew what to do.

You kind of felt in control.

But now you're in this brand new life and you feel out of control.

Because you don't know exactly what to do.

And then I always picture a little kid that's going to go and dress up like dad.

So they go in dad's closet and get out his suit.

And then they come out and it's so baggy and it's hanging off of them.

I think that's what a lot of people feel like in recovery.

This doesn't feel right.

This is awkward.

This feels like it belongs to somebody else.
