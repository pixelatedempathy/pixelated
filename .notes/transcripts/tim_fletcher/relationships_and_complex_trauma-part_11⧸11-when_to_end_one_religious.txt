They'll get over it.

But if you stay, you hurt yourself for months and years.

So you have to become convinced that you're valuable enough to protect, that you're valuable enough to take care of.

And that will involve hurting people's feelings at times.

But that's okay.

That's life.

That's what you got to do sometimes.

But you're worth it to do that.

So that is the ending of relationships.

What I find interesting, if you were to follow my life as a counselor, is probably 75% of the time when couples come to see me, I say, I don't see any hope here.

Probably be a good idea to just talk about ending it.

Now it's bad when a counselor, 75% of his advice say it's post.

Get over it.

There's very few times when I say, yeah, keep working.

Because usually so much damage has been done that it's irreparable.

And what I say to people is this, you scrambled an egg.

It's really hard to unscramble an egg.

And that's what you're dealing with.

So part of my job is just to help people see the reality of it, to validate some of their perceptions and feelings, and then leave the choice with them.

Some do end it.

Most say I'm going to keep trying.

And then they come and see me a year later and things are even worse.

So you're going to have to make those hard decisions.

All I've wanted to do tonight is lay out some of the things that are very important to think through, process, and I hope you'll make good decisions.

So we've been doing with this relationship piece in the Christian section, the relationship with God.

And we've been looking at it.

We've been looking at kind of the difficulties that people from complex trauma have when it comes to developing a relationship with God.

So first it's, I don't think God would want a relationship with me.

I've screwed up too bad.

How could He love me?

And then I don't know if I can trust God because I've always seen Him as kind of an angry, mean God.

So we've been talking about that.

Tonight I want to talk about one of the most difficult parts of this trusting God.

Because we've said that the relationship with God is really a relationship where you just grow in your trust of Him, His promises, and all of that.

So the scenario is like this.

If God is a loving God, and He was watching me getting sexually abused and I prayed and begged for Him to stop it, why didn't He stop it?

How can I trust a God who didn't enter into my life?

Why didn't He answer my prayer from a very painful place as a child?

And I want to say up front that that is a very difficult question to answer.

I don't know if we can ever totally answer it.

I'm going to try to give you pieces to the answer tonight that I hope will help you.

But I want you to understand that I don't pretend to say I have the whole answer for that.

But there's two things that are important to factor into your thinking.

And that's what we're going to talk about tonight.

Number one, though God is God, when He created this world, He did not create us to be robots that just loved Him or did nice things to each other.

He created with us a free will.

Now in order to have a free will where I can choose to love, I also have to have the option of choosing to be unloving.

Otherwise, free will means nothing if I only have one option.

So God created us with the ability to love or to hurt.

Now when God set up the world, He basically made an agreement with Himself that He would not interfere.

If people want to be nice, fantastic, if people are going to hurt each other, I will not interfere.

So He is not a God that comes and stops every person who's about to do something wrong and say I'm going to take away your free will for a while and I'm going to make you a robot again because you can't hurt.

He says no, to give free will I have to accept the ramifications of people having free will and not interfere.

So what we find out early in the Bible is that as soon as people come to God, they kind of turn their back on God, they started hurting each other.

And then generations after generations of hurting each other and God did not interfere.

But what He did was, He said two things.

Number one, hopefully the pain that they cause will cause people to say this is no way to live, I need God, I want to come back to live by God's design so that the pain and heartache would be a motivation of driving people back to God.

And many of you have sat in detox or at a bottom and for the first time in years in your life you've reached out to God and said please help me.

So it turned you back to God.

Second thing, God says when a person turns back to me and surrenders their life to me, Romans 8.28 gives us this beautiful promise, God causes all things to work together for our good.

For those who love Him, those who have surrendered to Him.

Notice it doesn't say God just takes the good things we do and turns them for good.

He says all things.

The bad crap that happened to you, the bad decisions you've made, God says if you surrender to me, I will take all of those negatives and turn them into a positive.

And that is His promise.

And I can honestly say I've seen Him do that in my own life.

And I've seen Him do it in thousands of lives.

Do you realize in my own life the things that have caused me the greatest pain and heartache are now the things that I have that make me a good teacher to addicts.

Because I learned from them and God turned them into a good.

So that's the story I want to tell you about.

Last week we talked about Jacob the master manipulator.

And remember he wanted to marry, his cousin Rachel who was drop dead gorgeous and he ended up getting Leah whose name means cow.

Okay.

So they didn't get along together.

And he favored Rachel over Leah.

But Rachel couldn't have kids.

She was barren.

So she says no problem.

I will go and get my servant girl and she'll sleep with Jacob.

And the rules at that time was any child she has would be Rachel.

Rachel's child.

So they do that.

So now Rachel's got three women he's sleeping with.

If you're following that.

And then Leah who is like a rabbit and popping them out all of a sudden couldn't have babies.

So she said I'm going to get my servant girl to sleep with Jacob.

So now he's got four.

So there are 13 kids.

Four moms.

Now Joseph was the first born son of Rachel.

So she eventually was able to conceive.

And she had Joseph.

So favorite wife has a child.

Guess how Joseph is treated by Jacob?

Spoiled rotten.

Favorite child.

So what we are told he does is he gives Joseph a coat.

Now if you went to Sunday school you heard the story of the coat of many colors.

And in your mind you're going oh there was a red line and an orange line.

And a blue line and a green line.

There was many colors.

That's not what it means.

What it means was it was a coat that said two things.

Number one it said you don't have to work.

So it was a coat where the sleeves went right down to the wrists.

So in that culture when you worked you pushed your sleeves up so your arms were free.

But if you got a coat like that you didn't have to work.

So he was spoiled in the fact that everybody else had to go to work.

He didn't.

And then it meant you're going to get the inheritance.

So all the older brothers and he had ten older brothers they're not getting the inheritance you are.

So can you imagine how the ten older brothers felt about little Joseph?

And then to make things worse Joseph has this dream.

And he comes out and he wants to announce it at breakfast to all his brothers and his dad.

And he says I had a dream and I became the most important person in the world and you bow down to me.

Now they're going this has gone to his head.

This guy's got an ego problem.

He's got a head the size of a barn.

He is out of control.

Instead of Joseph seeing their reaction he has a second dream and he announces it at breakfast and says same dream just a little different but I'm still the greatest person and you're all bowing down to me.

So what happens we're told is that those brothers hated him and in the Bible it says they hated him and then it repeats it how much they hated him.

They hated him with great hatred.

All of those things so you get the idea.

They couldn't stand him.

And so they became very abusive to him.

They verbally abused him.

Always putting him down.

And so he lived in a family where there's favoritism was very dysfunctional and now there's all kinds of bullying and abuse happening.

So what happens one day the older brothers they were shepherds have taken all the sheep quite a ways away from home because that's where the pasture was and they've been away for a while and so dad's Jacob says to Joseph please go check that your brothers are okay.

So Joseph goes off to check on his brothers and they see him coming with his fancy sheep.

And they go here is our chance to get rid of this jerk.

And so they basically decide they're going to kill him.

And then one of the brothers says no I couldn't do that.

Let's sell him.

So there was a band of traders.

So they were right on the major trade route in the whole world.

So all eastern people that were going to Egypt which was the world power traveled right by where they had to and they were going to Egypt and they were going to Egypt.

They had their sheep.

So they see a bunch of traders coming and they offer to sell Joseph to them.

And they buy Joseph.

So he is taken down to Egypt and sold as a slave.

Now that's a tragedy.

You are taken and he would be stripped naked he would be put on an auction block he wouldn't understand the language people would be poking at him because his skin color was a little bit dark and he was a little bit different.

And he would be abused and then he was purchased as a slave.

And that meant he was at the lowest rung of the ladder.

Can you imagine that little guy he is still in his teens saying God where are you?

You gave me a dream I was going to be the greatest person in the world.

This isn't what is happening here.

He was missing dad.

He felt abandoned total rejection.

He felt totally lost and confused in a foreign culture.

He felt great pain because of his new slave status and the abuse he was receiving.

A major tragedy.

Doesn't end there.

He is purchased by a guy by the name of Potiphar.

And what we are told about him is that he was Pharaoh's bodyguard.

The head of the bodyguards.

And what that means is he was deeply trusted by Pharaoh.

He was very close to Pharaoh who is the king of the world.

And Pharaoh says I will put you in charge of my safety.

So he is a really really high up guy.

So he buys Joseph.

Joseph is a slave.

But Potiphar begins to notice that Joseph is smart.

And he is really good and organized.

And he has a really good attitude.

He is not like a bitter angry slave that he is used to having.

So he says I am going to make him responsible for more things in the house.

And over time he puts Joseph in charge of everything.

All his money.

All his possessions.

He trusts Joseph that much.

Problem.

He has got a wife who is horny.

Potiphar is away a lot.

Joseph is a young good looking buck.

So she starts saying Hey Joseph.

I would really like to go to bed with you.

Now think of you are Joseph.

Some of you are saying okay go ahead.

Let's go.

Joseph said no.

I will not hurt my master by cheating with you.

She keeps it up.

Now Joseph could have said well she is the boss.

I guess I better do what I am told.

He keeps saying no.

He says I can't do that to my master.

And I can't do that to my God.

And you go whoa.

He still believes in the God that let him become a slave.

This guy is trusting this God even though he is a slave.

That is amazing.

So one day Potiphar's wife says Joseph come to bed with me.

And that morning she made sure nobody else was in the house.

She got rid of all the other slaves.

And she grabs him to force him to go to bed.

And he runs.

So he lets go of his coat.

She is grabbing his coat.

And he is running off.

Potiphar comes home that night and guess who is standing there with the coat.

His wife saying Joseph tried to rape me and I grabbed his coat.

No trial.

Joseph is put in prison.

But it is not just a prison.

It is a dungeon.

It is a dungeon where people went who were the worst criminals.

It was dirty, wet, rat infested.

That is where Joseph went.

Well so much for my dream of being the greatest person in the world.

Here I am again.

I just started getting my hopes up again.

I was getting responsibilities and respect.

And now I am falsely accused.

Terrible injustice has been done.

And I am stuck in jail until I die.

There will be no trial.

Imagine the confusion and the pain and the hurt he would have had.

Well the jail keeper, the boss notices this prisoner that is not like other prisoners.

He is polite.

He works hard.

He does his chores.

He is not angry.

So he starts giving him responsibilities around the jail.

And he does a beautiful job.

And he says you know what I am going to put him in charge of the care of some of the most important prisoners.

So Joseph gets elevated again in a jail.

And then one day two people land up in jail.

And they are Pharaoh's baker and cupbearer.

So there were three people in Pharaoh's life who were the closest to him that he trusted his whole life to.

His bodyguard, Potiphar.

His baker and cupbearer.

They tested the food the baker did before Pharaoh ate it.

And the cupbearer drank every liquid before Pharaoh drank it.

So if a person wanted to poison him the cupbearer would drop over dead.

If the baker dropped over dead Pharaoh would stay alive.

So somebody has tried to poison Pharaoh and he has gotten very sick.

And Pharaoh says well it is either the baker or the cupbearer that is the only way poison could get through.

So both of them are going to jail.

So Joseph has them.

And he builds a relationship with them.

Treats them with respect.

Gets to know them.

One morning he comes to them and they are so sad and troubled.

And he says what is the matter?

And they said we both had a dream.

And we don't know what it means.

Now if I was Joseph I would say don't believe dreams.

You want to know what he says?

God gives dreams and God can give me the meaning of your dreams.

Tell me your dreams.

So he listened to the dreams.

So he is still trusting God somehow.

He listens to the dreams and he says to the baker your dream means you are going to die.

You are guilty.

Cupbearer you are innocent.

You are going to get restored.

Happens just as it happens.

Just as Joseph said.

So as the cupbearer is going off to be restored.

Joseph takes him aside and he says you have got to know me.

I am in jail.

I didn't do anything wrong.

It is unjust.

Please put in a good word to Pharaoh for me.

And the cupbearer says sure thing I promise I will talk to Pharaoh and you will be out of jail.

He promptly forgets all about it.

So you can imagine Joseph the next morning waiting at his cell door.

They are going to let me out today.

Maybe I will shave and comb my hair.

Nobody shows up.

The next day, the next day, nothing, nothing.

Two years pass.

Nothing.

And you go where is God in all of this?

Well then amazing thing happens.

Pharaoh, it is his birthday and he has a dream.

The night of his birthday.

And he talks to all of his wise men.

And they can't tell what his dream means.

And his cupbearer goes bingo.

I remember a guy that interprets dreams.

He is in jail.

Oh did I ever blow that one?

I forgot.

And they rush and they get Joseph and says to Pharaoh the mightiest man in the world tell me your dream.

And he tells Joseph his dream.

He says here is your dream.

Here is what your dream means.

There is going to be seven years of plenty.

Bumper crops for seven years.

Seven years of famine.

He says here is what I do if you don't mind me giving my opinion Mr.

Pharaoh.

During the seven years of plenty tax the people 20% of the grain and fill up silos with grain so that when the famine hits there is enough food to feed everybody.

And Pharaoh says what a wonderful idea.

You know what?

I am putting you in charge of the whole land.

You are the boss.

I will be higher than you in title but you are going to be the king of the world.

Wow!

There is a dream.

Now why did that happen?

To really appreciate it you have got to understand there is another perspective happening here.

So way back God said when he brought Israel into Israel as it is today.

He said there is still nations all around Israel that are so screwed up that it would like taking a little kid and putting him in prison and say raise my kid.

It would destroy them.

So my little wee nation I have got to take and put them kind of in a bubble for a while so they can grow and get strong.

So I have got to take them out of their promised land and put them in a safe bubble for 400 years so they can grow as a nation.

Now how am I going to get people to go from their nice little new land that they love and are not going to leave.

How am I going to get them to leave it?

I am going to send a famine.

If there is a famine where would they go for food?

Well Egypt has the Nile River and it is the bread basket of the world so they will go to Egypt to get food.

That is great so far but there is a problem.

Egyptians hate people from Israel.

So the only way they are going to let them come to Egypt to eat is if somebody who loves Jews is in Egypt in the government.

Well how am I going to get somebody who loves Israel into the government and for them to get into the government they have got to rub shoulders with influential people.

They have got to get to know how the government runs.

They have got to get training on being a good administrator.

How am I going to do that?

Well I have some brothers who hate their brother.

I am not interfering.

I am just letting people do their thing.

They are going to sell them.

He is going to be a slave.

He is going to get training with Potiphar.

Rub shoulders with the high and mighty.

He is going to go to prison.

He is going to get training there and rub shoulders with the three closest people to Pharaoh.

Pharaoh is going to have a dream.

Well isn't that interesting?

So what happened was this.

The famine hit.

Guess who shows up one day?

Juan and Graeme.

His ten older brothers.

Now if that was me I would say you are all dead.

Because you screwed me over.

But here is what he says.

It says his brothers came and bowed before him just like his dreams said they would do.

And they thought they would never do.

But they came and threw themselves into the fire.

They threw themselves on the ground before him.

And here is what he says.

You intended to harm me but God intended it for good.

To accomplish what is now being done.

The saving of the world.

So he says yeah you guys did wrong.

You guys hurt me greatly.

But I have a God that took all of that crap and worked it into a plan so that good came upon me so that good came out of it which is the salvation of many lives.

You want to know?

That is the promise God makes to you.

Crap happens.

You are going to get hurt.

And you are going to wonder where God is.

And God says hang in there and trust.

And you will find that I will take that crap and I will turn it into good and use you to help others.

Trust in God and you don't get hurt so easily.

You didn't want to go to heaven saying I'm going to turn you into what God thought you were and how would I be?

You are going to be Ryan and I will turn you into this dead body.

Thank you.

You are already going to, in your healing we now say give me our supplication on the
