Today where I want to go is to the results of trauma.  And if you were to go to the average program for being offered to people with trauma, what you would probably get is a program that focused on the physical results of trauma.  So they would talk about if you become emotionally dysregulated, the startled response, the hypervigilance.  And all of those are debilitating things to have to deal with in adult life.  They can really mess stuff up.

But I would say that that's not the most negative consequence of trauma.  It's not in the physical stuff.  It is in shame.  It is in how it shapes our identity.

I want to start with what I would consider to be the greatest negative consequence that comes out of trauma.  And that is it creates a negative identity.  I find it very interesting.  We have had other programs, other agencies that have checked out our program, our material, and have basically said to me, we teach basically most of what you teach, all except for the shame piece.  And I always think, wow.  You have missed the greatest negative consequence.  The most far-reaching consequence of trauma.

Now, this shame word is a really tricky word because it's a word that's not clearly understood.  It's not a word that we talk about much in our culture.  It is a word that most people do not understand.  And so most people, when they hear shame, they think, oh, I do not have shame.  When actually, it's a very clear word.  When actually, they are probably controlled by shame.  They have tons of shame.  It is just buried so deep or not even recognized because it's not been taught or understood.

But it is running their life powerfully in a negative way.  And so that is why I really want to take tonight to develop and help you understand what is shame.  So that you get a very clear, picture of it.  And then you can begin to understand if you have it in your own life and how it's impacting you.  Where most people begin when they think of shame is really the wrong start starting point.  They think of shame as an emotion.  So they go, I feel ashamed.  So that's what shame is, which is I feel embarrassed or shame on you.  That emotion part of shame.  So let's start with it.  Shame, yes, is an emotion.

But shame, primarily, is not about emotion.  Shame is about a belief, a core belief about my identity.  And it's that core belief that produces emotions if that belief is triggered.

But shame is about a core belief about my identity that I am not going to let go.  That I am not good enough.  I am not valuable.  I am not lovable.  I have a negative identity.  That is the core understanding of shame.  So when you take the word, I feel ashamed or shame on you.  What is actually happening there is there's blending of two concepts that are similar, that overlap, but are different.  And that is shame and guilt.  And that's where a lot of people get confused because they think shame equals guilt.  So let me explain the difference.  It's really important to understand it and then how they overlap.  Guilt is about what I do, actions wise.  Shame is about who I am.  So guilt is a radar system inside of me that is triggered.  Every time I do something that violates love.  So I tell a lie.  I am unkind to somebody.  I am abusive.  I feel guilt.  It is saying what you have done is harmful.  It is wrong.  If you continue doing that, you are going to hurt your relationships.  You are going to hurt yourself.  You are going to hurt others.  So guilt is a negative emotion.  That is to be a positive motive.  A positive motivator to get back to living lovingly.  To doing things that are characterized by love.  So guilt is a negative emotion that is designed to motivate me to resolve it.  Which means change my behavior.  Shame is about who I am.  Shame is basically saying, I do not have value.  I am not lovable.  I am not good enough.  I am less than.  So what can happen in many complex trauma homes is parents can say, You did something bad so you are bad.  And they blend and confuse guilt and shame.  So because you did bad actions, your identity is bad.

But the problem with shame, it's this painful emotion but the child cannot resolve it.  Because if I am bad, how do I fix that?  Because I keep doing some bad things.  And so now guilt feeds shame.  Every time I do something bad, I not only have guilt, I now go, oh that proves I am bad.  And it feeds that negative identity.  So that's where they overlap.  That's where the one can feed the other.  Now there's another piece that comes out of this in complex trauma.  And it's false guilt.  And it's a poorly trained conscience.  And that's where a child is made to feel guilty for something they did not do wrong.  So dad says, I drink because you are such a bad kid.  So now the child feels guilty every time he drinks.  And the child feels guilty every time their dad drinks because they think I have done something wrong.  Or I am angry and it's your fault.  Well dad might be angry because they did something that triggered his anger.

But he's angry because of his stuff.

But the child now feels guilty every time the parent has a negative emotion.  It's my fault.  My parent is going through that emotion.  And I am going through that emotion that way.  And so false guilt gets blended in.  And you cannot resolve false guilt because you did not do anything wrong.

But you feel guilty anyways.  And that feeds into shame even more.  So hopefully that helps you understand the difference between guilt and shame.  Guilt about what I do.  Shame about who I am.  So let's move into this topic of how does a child develop an identity?  So subconsciously a child comes into the world.  Who am I?  That's the question.  I do not have a clue who I am.  And so am I lovable?  Do I have value?  Do I matter to anybody?  Does anybody delight in me?  Do I have anything to offer?  All of those are happening subconsciously in a child.  How do they get an answer to those questions?  They do it by how do the significant people in my life treat me?  Respond to me?  What do they say to me?  So do I matter becomes do I matter to them?  If I do not seem to matter to them, then I do not matter.  Am I lovable?  Well, am I loved to them?  By them?  Am I lovable to them?  If I do not seem to be lovable to them, I must not be lovable.  So they get the answers to those questions based on how mom and dad treat them.  That becomes their basis of answering those questions.  And so do you see all of those questions are identity questions?  Am I lovable?  Am I valuable?  Am I desirable?  Do I have anything to offer?  Do I matter?  How do mom and dad treat me?  And what do they say to me?  That answers those questions.  So if mom and dad neglect me, well, I guess I do not matter.  And what happens then in the child's mind is it's my fault.  They do not have the ability to say mom and dad have issues.  It's their stuff.  I have value.  No, they go the reason I am being neglected is I do not matter.  It must mean I am not valuable.  And so they begin to form their identity based on how mom and dad treat them.  So a good metaphor for this is to think of a mirror.  So a child comes in the world and they do not have a clue what they look like physically.  How do they get the picture of how they look like?  They look in a mirror and it reflects back to them a picture of who they are.  A child comes into the world and they do not know who they are internally.  How do they get a picture?  They look at the mirror of mom and dad.  And mom and dad reflect back to them a picture of who they are.

But if mom and dad are messed up, they are getting a distorted picture back.  And so what you begin to see is shame is a picture that a child develops about themself that is all based on lies.  It is based on distortions.

But to the child, it's the truth.  Because that's how mom and dad are treating them.  So let me take that example further.  I do not know how many of you have been to a house of mirrors where you go in and see all these distorted mirrors.  So let's just imagine that you are six feet tall and very thin.  And you walk into a house of mirrors and you look in the mirror and you are four feet tall and four feet wide.  Okay, so take that picture and put that into a complex trauma family so that a child grows up and the only mirrors they have are distorted mirrors.  And so every time they look in the mirror, they are four feet wide and four feet tall when actually they are six feet tall and skinny.

But every day they look into this mirror, four feet tall, four feet wide.  That's all they see.  That's the only picture they get back to them.  And then one day they go to a friend's house who has an accurate mirror and it shows them as six feet tall and skinny.  What's going to go on in their head?  Something wrong with that mirror.  They are not going to question the mirror at home.  They are going to question the friend's mirror because to them the mirror at home is the truth.  And so what happens to a lot of people that come out of complex trauma with a distorted mirror that says I am not lovable, I am not valuable, that's why I am being abused, that's why I am being neglected.  It's my fault.  They come into recovery and they come and they meet somebody like you and you say to them, I am getting to know you, you are a wonderful person.  You just contradicted the mirror.  So what's going on in their head?  , they are just saying that to be nice.  They do not really mean it.  They just discounted your message because it did not match the mirror.  Or they go, I wonder what they want.  They have got to be manipulating me somehow.  That's why they are saying nice things to me.  And so that core identity has been so reinforced over the years that now when you try to change it, you run into all these roadblocks that discount the truth because it does not match the core message.  And that's the challenge in dealing with shame.  So you could go to that person and go, do you have value?  And they could go out of their cortex, yes, I am a wonderful person.

But they are operating out of that old mirror that says I am not lovable.  And when they get into relationships, all of those things come out.  They become people pleasers, perfectionists.  And they do all kinds of things because they think if you get to know me, then you are going to treat me like mom and dad did.  You are going to abandon me, you are going to neglect me.  And so shame then governs how they approach relationships.  So that's a little taste of what we are getting into.  Some of you might be wrecked already, but let me take it further.  Here's the key piece, I think, to put this into a picture for you.  If you look at a child growing up in a home that is healthy, what identity are they going to walk away with?  Their needs are consistently met.  They are being validated, they are being nurtured, they are accepted for who they are.  They are being loved, comforted when they are crying and all of that.  They are being connected with by parents who want to be with them.  When parents see them, their eyes light up.  They go, I have value.  I am lovable.  I matter.  They have a positive identity.  That's the way it should be.  And then they go into life with that positive identity.

But what happens again?  What comes when that does not happen?  You get neglect and abuse.  I guess I am not lovable.  I guess I am not valuable.  I guess I am less than everybody else.  And so then you have all the self-esteem problems that come out of that.

So, we are going to go into the heavier part now and go through some of the causes.  So what are some of these mirrors that send back to a child this distorted message that they interpret as their core identity which is actually a shame identity?

So, we talked about any type of abuse.  The child says, it's my fault.  I am being abused because I must be bad.

So, physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse.  Then you take a child that's put into children's aid society.  Children that go through being adopted.  Children that go through a divorce where all of a sudden they are separated and they feel somewhat abandoned.  They feel, I guess I am abandoned.  I guess I was put up into children's aid or all of that because I am not good enough.  And if they are adopted, they might end up with wonderful parents.

But deep down, there's this haunting question of why did my original parents not want me?  Why did they get rid of me?  And they can know that the parents did not have the ability to take care of them.

But there's still this original message that says something must have been wrong with me.

And so, that is a powerful thing.

So, there's actually new studies coming out to study the effects of divorce that we are seeing so rampant in our culture.  And more and more, all the tests are saying it's having way more effect on children than we thought as far as because of the trauma and the shame message that comes out of that.  Then the neglect.  We talked about that last time, the emotionally unavailable.

But it does not have to be necessary that parents just like their work more than their kids.  It could be a parent who has a chronic illness and just cannot be there for the kids.  It could be parents who have mental health issues that just cannot be consistently there.

And so, the children, they still interpret it that it's my fault.  And they develop the shame message.  Okay, now let me go into some new stuff.

Let me go into some new stuff here.  If a child grows up in a home where every time they offer their opinion, it kind of gets laughed at, they begin to get the message, you are stupid.  You do not matter.  Your opinion does not matter.  If parents roll their eyes, if brothers and sisters roll their eyes, or snicker whenever they say something, it sends that message back to them.  If they were told by parents, or brothers and sisters, you will never amount to anything, you cannot do anything right, you are such a failure, that's a powerful, powerful message that shapes their core identity.  Families that find humor at others' expense, teasing, name-calling, practical jokes, where the other person is always made to feel embarrassed, stupid, laughed at, that sends that message to them.  Or you get families with kids come home with straight A's and one B, and the parents do not congratulate them for the straight A's, they go, how come you got a B?  So it does not matter how good they try, how hard they try, it's never good enough in their family.  They can never be good enough.  And that sends the exact same message.  Or parents that say, why cannot you be like your brother?  Why cannot you be like your cousin?  Or father, when father is close to you day and night.  It does not make sense.  It's your fault that their kid is one step too far away from them.  If you are too impressed, their needs are not consistently met.  The next one is huge.  Children when they are struggling or they are excited about something and they just want to connect with their parents and tell them about it or cry or get help and they try to connect but the parents are not wanting to connect.  That sends the message you do not matter.  You are not valuable enough to connect with.  Or families where you cannot express all your emotions.  So you are going to keep crying.  You are going to go to your room and do not come out till you got a smile on your face.  If you are going to keep crying I am going to give you something to cry about.  What that says to the child is there's parts of me that are bad.  There's parts of me I have to hide.  I have to hate because they make me undesirable.  And that sends a shame message.  Or parents that make promises and break them to the child.  In the child's mind it must be because I am not good enough.  That's why my parents keep breaking their promises.  Flip side of all of that is you get the spoiled child and you go how could a spoiled child ever end up with shame where they are given gift after gift after gift.  They are led away with stuff.  They can do whatever they want.  Do you want to know what the child wants?  Do not try to buy my love.  Give me yourself.  And if you are not going to give me yourself then I do not feel valuable.  Regardless of the gifts you give.  And if you cared enough you would set boundaries for me.

But the fact you set no boundaries and just let me do whatever I want.  Bottom deep down says you do not care.  And they get the same message out of that.  Conditional love.  Parents that give the silent treatment.  Parents that withhold love until the child does what they want.  That sends the same message.  Shame-based parenting.  Where if you do something wrong it's not the parents response is not just to correct it and to love you back.  The parents have got to shame you.  They got to make you really feel bad.  That sends the same message.  Or you have parents who are all about their image.  So their value system is money, things, the house, the car, how they look in public.  And what the child is getting, is that matters more than me.  Because the parents put more energy into that than the relationship with me.  And then other possible causes.  It's very interesting to me that studies have been done on children who bed wet.  So about 10% of children bed wet.  Past kind of when they are potty trained.  Of those who become addicts and end up with more severe trauma, that bed wetting goes on.  And what often happens is the parents response when they are exasperated with the bed wetting is they start to shame the child.  They start to do things that put the child down.  Which feed shame.  Which sets a child up for addiction.  Because addiction medicates the pain of that shame.  Families who are very poor.  So everybody else at school has new clothes.  They are always wearing hand-me-downs.  They are always wearing hand-me-downs.  They are always wearing hand-me-downs.  Worn out clothes.  They cannot do other stuff.  It's subtle.  The parents may not control it.

But the child is perceiving that even in society I am not good enough.  I do not make the mark.  Children coming from a different ethnic culture.  Who then come into a Canadian culture and they do not fit in.  They do not feel understood.  They are teased a little bit.  That can send all of that.  Or back in the day where there were big families.  Parents love those kids to death.  They just had no time for them because they were worn out from taking care of all the others.  So the child felt neglected like they did not matter.  So those are a whole bunch of things that can send the shame message.  Self-awareness.  Begin to understand what triggers those shame beliefs and feelings.  So what triggers you to feel shame?  Or to start thinking shame lies?  Or to start beating yourself up?  Understand those triggers.  So self-awareness.  And then understand once you are triggered.  How do you behave?  How does it affect you?  How does it affect your actions?  How does it affect your thinking?  How does it affect other emotions?  As you begin to understand your triggers and your patterns.  What's going to happen is the next time you are triggered.  You start to act you are going to go oh shame must have been triggered because that's what happens when i get triggered by shame wonder what's going on here and you can stop it before it progresses and you can get to what is going on so that you can begin to heal it second thing replace the lies that shame has taught you about yourself with the truth so there's an element of healing from shame that is cognitive it's your thinking it is changing that now what's important is that's only one piece of the healing a lot of people try to put all their eggs in that one basket and say just change your thinking and that will fix it that's one part you got to do a whole bunch more though if you are going to actually heal from shame third one gain a sense of what gives me value you you you you Vanguardorage 8 Bad to S Matrix Magnlane I offers a life experience to heal and switch from that type of place we become Eleusting and everyone is able to change I know you know the!

But Humans have inherent value.  That's why we treat babies the way we do.  And that's why we treat elderly people who can no longer keep a job, who have Alzheimer's.  We still care for them because they have value.  So you do too.  So that's where you begin is by saying, I do not feel value, but I know I have it.  And that's a good enough place to begin.  Next one.  This is important.  So we are going to look next time at our brain.  And we have a limbic brain, which is our emotional brain, and then the cortex brain, which is our thinking adult brain.  The limbic brain is the child brain, and that's where shame is.  And it creates the feelings of shame and the distorted beliefs of shame.  So what happens when I get triggered is my limbic brain makes your illusions and your feelings of shame and the distorted beliefs of shame.  And that's where the emotion of shame is.  And that's where the emotion of shame and the distorted beliefs of shame is.  So I am going to go to my cortex and say, but I know I have value.  That's the truth.  My limbic brain is lying to me right now, so I am going to believe the truth.  Second thing is your limbic brain says, treat yourself the way you are feeling right now.  So if you are feeling like a loser, treat yourself like a loser.  Beat yourself up.  The cortex says, no, you have value.  Treat yourself with respect, even though you feel like you do not deserve respect.  And so the battle begins by getting out of my limbic brain into my cortex and acting based on what I know is true, even though it does not feel true.  And I treat myself with respect, even though something in me wants to beat myself up and put myself down.  I choose to be true.  I choose to treat myself with respect.  So what we often say to clients is, you are acting your way through your cortex to a re-education of your limbic brain to a new way of feeling about yourself.

But it has to start in your cortex.  Next one, choose to accept yourself.  Choose to accept the body that you have.  Choose to accept the personality that you have.  It's a choice.  It begins there.  That is, very difficult, but it is an important part.  So healing shame is not feeling better about yourself as the first step.  Healing shame is choosing to accept the package, who you are.  And that's where it begins.  Next, accept your past.  Many people look back and it feeds their shame.  I am a loser.  Look at all the crap that happened to me.  Look how nobody wants me.  Nobody wanted to be with me.  And they just keep feeding off of all of that negative stuff in their past.  And what I say to people is, you cannot go back and change your past.  You cannot go back and get new parents.  You cannot go back and get a different childhood.  Accept that and learn from it.  And let it guide you to actually growing.  And then accept the slow growth process.  We all wish there was a magical, pill somewhere that would instantly heal shame.  Do you want to know how long it takes to heal shame?  The rest of your life.  There's no magic pill.  It is the slowest healing part of the trauma journey.  And when you think of it, it's the first thing that started right from infancy.  That belief.  And so it's not going to heal quickly.  It's going to heal up, down.  You are going to make progress.  You are going to regress.  It's messy.

But it heals.  So what you are going to find as you grow is, you are going to begin to get triggered less often.  And then when you are triggered, you are going to be able to process through that trigger quickly.  Whereas in the past, that trigger might have taken you down, spiraling down for two days.  Now you can get through it in half an hour.  And then as you keep growing, those triggers will become less intense.  Because you are quickly going to be able to go, that's their crap, not mine.  And so it's not going to bother you as much.  So accept the slow journey.  And then learn to forgive yourself and deal with this internal critic.  A lot of people find it helpful to see that internal critic as kind of somebody else.  And have an argument with it and say, would you shut up?  Because you are telling me lies right now and I do not have to listen to you.  So learn to deal with that.  So here's a big piece of all of this that I want you to see.  Many parents use what we call shame-based parenting, which is the way to motivate a child is to tear them down, criticize them.  That will make them want to improve.  And that works short term.  And studies have shown that.

But if you do that as the norm, it eventually, beats the child down so they do not want to.  So what happens to a lot of people when they come into working on themselves, is they still try to shame-based parent themselves.  They beat themselves down.  Thinking that's going to motivate them to want to change.  And they actually feed their guilt, they feed their shame, hoping it's going to motivate them to change.  It does not.  So there's over a hundred different tests that have been done to say, what is the one main thing that causes lasting change and a desire to change?  People are expecting shame.  Guess what it was?  Self-compassion.  Be kind to yourself.  Forgive yourself.  Say, hey, I cannot go back and redo that.  I am not going to beat myself up, but I am going to learn and I am going to change.  I am not saying it was okay, but the solution is not beating myself up, the solution is changing.  So learn that self-compassion that is such an important part.  And then find accurate mirrors.  People that reflect back to you a more accurate picture of who you are.  And that means boundaries with unhealthy mirrors.  So if you still have family that is constantly criticizing, putting you down, you might have to have some boundaries with family.  See them less often.  Say, if you are going to talk to me that way, I am not going to be hanging around.

But you need boundaries.  So what I see all the time is people come into our program and they heal tremendously in their shame.  Then they go visit their parents for Thanksgiving or Christmas.  And they all come back just beaten like a little puppy again.  And what I tell people is shame when you heal initially is so fragile.  It can be undone.  It can be broken.  It can be broken in a heartbeat if you are back around the wrong mirrors.  So you are going to have to look at mirrors or boundaries with unhealthy mirrors.  And then connect with healthy people.  Shame is healed.  Bottom line, what's my goal been?  Nobody wants to connect with me, so I am going to hide.  I am going to connect with people.  And when I find people want to connect with me, you fill that little ribbon back into your mind and then there's a picture.  Ruby said that and we added mind-savingköhal Mode and show me how to prevent that.  Can someone say that to me too?  Do not let me find myself sitting here right next to you.  Die young on the edge.  I do not care anymore.  I do not already care anymore.  To help.  Next.  The healthiest, in a mutant case, with clean mind.  Continue learn to give and serve and this is tricky with shame because that can take you back to externals but there's some healing that comes when you are serving and you go my life is making a difference in others and then the spiritual mirror that we talked about can be such a healing source for many people so that is the shame healing let me say a final piece about it sadly to me many complex trauma families want their children to be humble but their definition of humility is actually shame that the child should think of themselves as not as good as others put themselves down never get never you talk about their accomplishments so their definition of humility is actually the shame the cure to shame is actually true humility and what's true humility it is seeing myself accurately it is seeing that i am just as important as you my needs are just as important as your needs so if i am in a relationship with you we are going to learn how to meet your needs and mine you and mine my needs and we are going to learn boundaries and I am going to learn to stand up for myself and I am going to learn to talk about my needs and so humility is what actually heals shame but for people that come out of complex trauma humility is scary because every time they tried to do that as a child they got humiliated and humiliation is their nose was rubbed in it they were made fun of and it was painful it fed shame and so it's an important process for them to learn true humility which is see myself accurately see my value stand up for my value but recognize that we are equal you.
