# Knowledge Synthesis & Future Optimization

## Learnings
- Modularization of clinical logic and bias detection is critical for maintainability
- Mock LLM invoker enables robust testing before full model integration
- Real-world edge case coverage is essential for clinical fidelity

## Patterns
- Use single-responsibility methods for analysis workflows
- Leverage Promise.allSettled for robust async operations
- Integrate audit logging and HIPAA compliance at every layer

## Future Optimization
- Upgrade to full LLM as dataset and compute allow
- Expand evaluation modules for therapist feedback
- Enhance cultural adaptation and crisis scenario coverage
