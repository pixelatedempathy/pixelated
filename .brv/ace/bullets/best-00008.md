Multi-modal risk assessment combines 5 data sources with weighted scoring: emotional (25%), behavioral (25%), clinical (25%), biometric (15%), contextual (10%). Each modality returns 0-1 risk score. Composite score determines risk level: minimal<0.1, low<0.25, moderate<0.5, high<0.75, imminent>=0.9. Always include confidence score based on data completeness and consistency.
