I love you.  I love you.  I love you.  Morning, honey.  Morning.  You woke me up.  Again.  How?  You were sleeping when I got up.  As usual, you wake up first and then you try to wake me up.  What?  You always do that.

But I was not trying to wake you up.  I just wanted to see if you were awake, maybe.  And that you woke me up.  Of course.  I hardly touched you.  Gosh, I was half asleep by myself.  I let you alone, did not I?  Why are you so bitchy this morning?  Have you slept poorly?  No.  I slept perfectly till you had to wake me up.  Can you please stop now?  Or do I want to ruin the whole day?  Here are your eggs.  Thank you, honey.  You know, I am sorry.  Maybe I did sleep badly.  I cannot really remember.  Thank you for the eggs.  It's okay, darling.  I am sorry.  I should not have touched you when you were asleep.  I know you do not like that.  It's okay.  It's not so important.  Let's eat now.  You cannot expect me to always clean up after you.  We are not in the 50s.  I have a job.  Why cannot we have a proper conversation about that?  Why do you switch now?  Fighting again?  Really?  Everything was just so fine.  You are always doing the same thing.  You are always ruining everything.  I do not want to talk to you.  I am sorry I am calling so late.  It's just.  I said.  He said.  Love at first sight makes you happy.  It's a big Ch product.  You get aÃ§Ãº iruli for any of yourss.  The killer's eyes.  InHey,d?  You talk about your doll, inherent pig of your stomach.  Anything that's uncomfortable.  At this particular moment, there's still a knife thatword of Vipshop finally scored my touching.  So.  Oh, attitude is so important.  You are looking great inside.  I am a little scared and distressed at yourys.  If you say shit like.  Buradan supervision only.  All the bad on the surface.  You want to go back and start getting patted matches?  You are not listening to Yusakun.  It's not like you have any contact with him.  You have said it so often.  It's clearly not what I consider necessary.  Sorry.  Who was it?  No one.  It does not matter.  So next week?  Yes.  Yes?  Great.  What do you have to say?  -oh.  Wait.  Let's find out.  Good night, honey.  Good night, honey.  Good night, honey.  Come on, come on, I do not want him to wait.  It's just five minutes.  I waited for you to leave the apartment, remember?  Now you command me to run?  I just cannot get anywhere because of the stupid five minutes.  I just cannot get anywhere because of the stupid five minutes.  Did Peter call you?  Do we have to hurry up?  No, but I do not want to be disrespectful towards him.  Go faster.  It's five minutes, just ride him.  I will not ride him.  Come on.  No.  We will be late.  Do as I say.  Are you crazy?  I am not your dog.  I do not want to make him wait.  Why?  It's so awful to let him wait five minutes.  What the fuck, Alex?  Just hurry up.  I do not want to make him wait.  If you say this one more time.  He seriously thinks I have to run after him?  I am not having this.  Goodness.  Not now.  Hi, Vicky.  Look, there are ways in which you can talk to me and others in which you cannot.  Look, there are ways in which you can talk to me and others in which you cannot.  It's non-negotiable.  If you bitch at me like that, I will not follow you anywhere.  If you bitch at me like that, I will not follow you anywhere.  It's your decision how you talk to me but it's also my decision if I am having that or not.  You understand?  Yes, you are right.  I know what you mean.  I should not talk to you like that.  Look, I am with Sonja now and I have to go to work soon, okay?  See you later, darling.  Okay.  Bye.  I really do not need stress like this before work.  Such a drama.  Why did you have to make such a.  ðŸŽµ Last week you did not close the door for me.  Come on, I am a show-in now.  I told you days ago, of course you know how to close the fucking door.  We have been living here for two weeks by now.  I cannot believe this.  Oh my god, I even sent you a fucking video of me closing the door for Christ's sake.  Leave me alone with this shit now.  Maria Caroline, from that show, then.  Are you insane?  We are talking grown-up women here and that includes me.  Would you ask a man, let's say Peter, to do the same thing?  If you did not close the door before, of course I would.  You fucking bastard knew you would not.  Stop it now!  You always know everything better.  You have got a problem, Vicky.  And it's also the reason why I do not have so many friends.  Open the door, Vicky.  What the fuck?  Go have your dinner.  That's hysterical, Vicky.  Do not you think you are a bit neurotic?  It was not for nothing.  Calm down, please.  Okay?  You are really overreacting right now.  I am sorry.  You have a talent for bringing me up the wall.  So why do you do that?  Do you enjoy having a tantrum.  Sorry.  Why do you do that?  What?  You know, we talked about that many times already.  Your anger problem and all this.  And I really do not want to talk about it anymore, but something will have to change.  You know?  Exactly.  Also, talking about old things is not really healthy.  You know that.  We talked about that too.  You seem really exhausted.  Maybe you should rest for tonight.  Hey, hey, how are you?  I am good.  You know what?  Today I went to the massage parlor, the new one down the street.  It was so painful.  Oh, I hate when they do that.  Yes, right?  And the thing is, I did not say anything.  Can you believe that?  I mean, I do not understand.  Why did not I tell her to not hurt me?  It was really painful.  You know?  Yes.  I am sorry.  I am sorry.  You know, sometimes we are so busy with getting hurt, like processing the pain really, or simply needing a moment to feel the relief in between that we cannot stand up for ourselves, I think.  You see, if the breaks between the painful experiences are too short, there's simply no energy left, I guess.  You know what I mean?  We hardly have enough time to gasp, let alone defend ourselves.  Oh my god.  You are so beautiful.  You are so beautiful.  You are so beautiful.  You are so right.  I mean, I did not even tell her when I was paying.  You know, like, the only time when they asked you if everything was alright.  Well, you probably did not feel like it because you did not say anything before.  And mentioning it now would seem rather stupid, would not it?  Yes.  Yes.  Without you acting all weird.  What is your problem?  Why do you put it on me?  Do you think you are a good person?  Careful.  You are such a crazy woman.  Maybe I should part with you.  Alright.  Am Iially sleeping with you?  Am Iially sleeping with you?  Am Iially sleeping with you?  Thanks to the viewers that made it in to honoring.  Let's do different things.  There are many possibilities in life but you are there.  Thank you.
