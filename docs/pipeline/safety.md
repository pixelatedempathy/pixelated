# Bias, Safety & Ethical Filtering Pipeline

## Overview

Phase 4 of the dataset pipeline implements comprehensive bias, safety, and ethical filtering to ensure the therapeutic AI training data is safe, fair, and compliant with clinical and ethical standards. This phase integrates clinical safety detectors, demographic balancing, bias detection with explainability, manual review workflows, configurable thresholds, comprehensive testing, documentation, monitoring, environment-specific configurations, and audit trails.

## Safety & Ethical Framework

### Clinical Safety Detection
- **Crisis Detection**: High-recall detection of crisis indicators (suicide, self-harm, violence) using keyword matching + BERT-based classifiers
  - Recall Target: 98% (prioritize catching all potential crises)
  - Precision: Reviewed manually for false positives
  - Flagging: Conversations with crisis scores > 0.7 quarantined for expert review
- **Harm Prevention**: Detection of harmful content (hate speech, misinformation, exploitation) using multi-model ensemble
  - Models: Custom TF-IDF + RoBERTa fine-tuned on therapeutic safety data
  - Threshold: Safety score < 0.8 → Flag or quarantine
- **Ethical Guidelines**: Compliance with APA ethical standards for AI in therapy
  - Checks: Consent language, confidentiality markers, appropriate boundaries
  - Integration: Pre-release ethical review for high-risk content

### Bias Detection & Mitigation
- **Demographic Bias**: Analysis across age, gender, ethnicity, socioeconomic indicators
  - Metrics: Disparity in representation (target: <5% deviation), conditional bias scores
  - Tools: SHAP for explainability on BERT embeddings, LIME for local interpretations
  - Balancing: Up-sampling underrepresented groups, down-sampling overrepresented
- **Content Bias**: Detection of biased language patterns in responses
  - Categories: Gender stereotypes, cultural insensitivity, ableism
  - Implementation: Custom bias classifier trained on annotated therapeutic dialogues
  - Explainability: SHAP values highlighting biased tokens in input/output

### Pipeline Integration
- **Gating Mechanism**: Safety checks as mandatory pipeline stage post-standardization
  - Block: High-risk content (crisis score > 0.9)
  - Quarantine: Medium-risk (bias score > 0.6 or safety < 0.7) for manual review
  - Flag: Low-risk issues (bias > 0.4) with metadata labels for downstream awareness
- **Thresholds & Circuit Breakers**:
  - Configurable per environment (dev: lenient, prod: strict)
  - Circuit Breaker: If >10% quarantined in batch, halt processing and alert
  - Adaptive Thresholds: Adjust based on dataset version and risk profile

### Manual Review Workflow
- **Quarantine Store**: Dedicated MongoDB collection for flagged/quarantined items
  - Fields: Original content, risk scores, explainability reports, review status
  - Workflow: Operator dashboard for review/approve/reject/edit
  - Audit Trail: All changes logged with reviewer ID, timestamp, rationale
- **Review Queue**: Prioritized by risk score (critical first)
  - Integration: API endpoints for review tools, webhook notifications for experts

### Testing & Validation
- **Unit Tests**: Individual component tests with representative vectors (e.g., crisis scenarios, biased examples)
  - Coverage: 95% for safety logic, edge cases for false positives/negatives
  - Frameworks: Pytest with parameterized tests, mock data generators
- **Integration Tests**: End-to-end pipeline tests with mixed safe/unsafe data
  - Scenarios: Crisis injection, bias injection, demographic imbalance
  - Assertions: Correct flagging/quarantining, no false negatives on critical content
- **Test Vectors**: Curated dataset of 1000+ annotated examples (safe, biased, crisis)
  - Sources: Synthetic + real anonymized therapeutic data
  - Metrics: Precision/Recall/F1 for each detector category

### Monitoring & Drift Detection
- **Drift Alerts**: Monitor model performance drift using KS-test on validation sets
  - Threshold: Drift p-value < 0.05 → Alert and retrain
  - Metrics: False positive/negative rates tracked per batch/version
- **Fairness Monitoring**: Demographic parity, equalized odds tracked in production
  - Dashboards: Grafana panels for real-time metrics, alerting on thresholds
  - Automated Reports: Weekly bias audits emailed to stakeholders

### Configuration & Environment Support
- **Environment-Specific**: Separate configs for dev/staging/prod (e.g., prod: stricter thresholds)
  - YAML config files with validation schemas
  - Secrets: API keys for bias models, thresholds loaded via env vars
- **Version Control**: Safety checks versioned with dataset (v1.0: initial, v2.0: enhanced bias detection)
  - Backward Compatibility: Graceful handling of legacy data

### Audit Trail & Reproducibility
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logs for all decisions (flag/quarantine/approve)
  - Levels: DEBUG (all actions), INFO (batch summaries), ERROR (failures)
  - Storage: Structured JSON logs in S3/MongoDB for compliance
- **Reproducibility**: Seeded random states, fixed model versions, deterministic processing
  - Checksums: Dataset integrity verified post-filtering
  - Lineage: Full provenance tracking from raw input to final output

## Integration with Downstream Components
- **Pre-Training**: Filtered dataset fed to SFT pipeline, with safety labels as additional metadata
- **Model Evaluation**: Safety metrics included in model cards, bias reports generated post-training
- **Deployment**: Runtime safety checks on generated responses, using same models
