 to do tonight is I want to give you really a bunch of background information. What the latest  research has been showing us and it's quite fascinating to me and what finding freedom is really  built on is the latest science and research around addiction. But if you have an addiction and 97%  of people with an addiction have what we are going to look at as this underlying issue, a trauma  issue. But it goes beyond that. If you have major anger issues, major emotional problems, major  relationship problems, if you struggle a lot with anxiety and depression or if you've been  diagnosed with borderline personality, probably this same underlying issue is what is going on  inside of you. And if you have this buzz word that is called codependency, that will be tied in as  well to this underlying thing which we talk about as complex trauma. So let me present what  finding freedom is about this way. We teach that though many people say addictions of my problem,  we say in a sense we agree it is a problem, but maybe a more correct way of looking at it is  that you viewed addiction as the solution to your problems. In other words, addiction is a symptom  of deeper problems. And that's what we are going to be trying to explain and understand.  So in the last 10 years, there's been a body of research that has been started, much of it  kind of spearheaded by Dr. Gaber Matei from Vancouver who's written a wonderful book on addiction  called in the realm of hungry ghosts. And he began the research and he said everybody I deal with  who's an addict has childhood trauma. And that led to a bunch of research that happened in all  kinds of different areas. And AFM published two years ago that 97% of addicts have complex trauma.  So what I want to do is explain that tonight. And then what we're going to do in the next few months  is that complex trauma, if you have it, it results in 50 different ways of living, coping,  relating. Addiction is only one of the 50. So we want to look at the other 49. And for some of you  it'll be depressing. For some of you you're going to go wow, am I ever screwed up? I knew I was a  little screwed up but not this screwed up. But for others of you you go okay now it makes sense.  Now I understand why I do what I do. And now I understand that to heal from addiction and recover,  I don't just need to stop using, I got to get healthy in those other 49 areas. Because if I  don't get healthy there, those other 49 areas will take me back to using again or to our relapse.  So trauma by definition is simply being in a dangerous situation or situation that you perceive  is so dangerous that it is beyond your ability to handle it. And so you are afraid that you are  either going to get hurt real badly, die or go crazy. So that is a definition of trauma. So it's  an event that is super dangerous, super scary. Two types of trauma and that's where this complex  thing. So simple trauma is what most of us would know as trauma and simple just means one time.  So it's a car accident, it's being raped, it's being jacked, all of those things, one time events,  scary like crazy. And that's you get over it or some don't, but it's a one time event. Complex  is just simply taking simple one time complex all the time. And what it simply means is that  if one of persons in an ongoing environment of danger, so it's not just a one time event,  it's where they always don't feel safe. They always feel they have to be on guard or they're  walking on eggshells and they are always ready to fight or flight. And that is the trauma response  is I don't have the tools to handle the danger. So my only options are to fight back or to flight or  get out of there as fast as I can. Now if it happens to a child, you're too little to fight back  and you're too little to run away. So there's a third option which is freeze. Shut everything down.  Try not to feel any any emotions, any pain, anything that would make me vulnerable or weak,  freeze everything up. And so that is what 97% of addicts experience growing up. So there's  four environments in which a person can experience complex trauma and they're listed from most severe  to least severe. And what you need to understand is there's a spectrum of complex trauma from  high severe complex trauma to milder doses of complex trauma. But in the end, they always seem  to take you to the same place. Fight, flight or freeze. And when you find drugs in alcohol,  you think I found the perfect way to fight, flight or freeze. So why do I need to do anything else?  I have found the solution to all my problems, the way to cope and it becomes your best friend.  So that is why 97% of people with complex or addicts have complex trauma. So the four  environments, number one, abuse. So physical abuse, verbal abuse, emotional abuse, sexual  abuse, spiritual abuse. If a child is worried on any given night that dad might be drunk and  beat mom up or beat the kids up or dad might yell and tear a strip out of you,  mom might pote, mom might give you the silent treatment, mom might call you down, mom might tease  you laugh at you, make fun of you, that's abuse. And what happens to a child with that,  that's a scary way to live. Because every day you're afraid you're going to get hurt or humiliated.  And so you live on eggshells, you live on guard, always ready to fight or flight.  And so many of you and for many years this was the only area that we looked at when it came to  understanding why people became addicts because it was the most obvious. The second one is a band-in-men.  When a child is abandoned, mom and dad aren't there for them. They're in a strange environment  all by themselves. What that means is they are now facing a dangerous world, a dangerous home,  a dangerous school life all alone. Without resources to handle it, without tools, without support,  to handle the dangerous world that they're in. So a band-in-men is one of the most severe,  but it's an emotional thing as well as a physical where you grow up feeling all alone. Your only  way of coping is nobody's giving you any other tools is fight, flight or freeze. And then the third one  is neglect. So what is coming out of the research is that neglect by a parent and what I mean by that  is your parents could be there physically for you by providing your physical needs. So you lived in  a nice house, lots of food, the best clothes, sports teams, all of those things. They're just not  there emotionally. Dad might be sitting in the same room, but dad is not emotionally available.  Mom might be in her depression, in her own addiction, in her own world. She is in the house,  but she is not there. So the child's emotional needs get neglected. And what we're finding is that  is justice severe as physical abuse. And it is justice severe as a bandiment because what happens  when a child is neglected, they feel abandoned. They feel all alone. And so as we look at the brain  of a child that is neglected, we see tremendous damage done. It doesn't develop in a healthy way,  and we will look at that in more detail in the future. The fourth is the most subtle,  but is probably maybe the most important in my mind. All of us as children have certain needs.  So we have a need to be loved unconditionally. We need to have a need to be accepted,  warts and all. We have a need to be valued that we matter and we need those needs consistently  met in us. But if you grow up in a home where you're teased and told your chubby all the time,  and that's your pet name, or they make fun of you because you're dyslexic and you don't read very  well, or you have buck teeth and braces and they make fun of you, all of that you don't feel accepted.  And what happens when a person doesn't feel accepted, you're always unguarded because somebody might  take a shot at you. Somebody might make fun of you and humiliate you. So you live in fight,  flight or freeze. So those are the four different scenarios that result in children having complex  trauma. Now you know what the sad reality is? Probably about 75% of our culture anymore has complex  trauma. How many of those people, if they live in a nice house and they got a good paying job  and they respond by being a perfectionist and an ultra achiever and a super responsible person,  how many of them are going to stop and say maybe I need to look at some problems in my life?  No, but addicts will because it takes you to a level of pain where you realize I better deal with  this or I'm in big trouble. So here's the diagram I use when I explain complex trauma. So in the  blue circle, there's the danger trauma pain that is there. If a child in a healthy family faces danger,  faces potential problems, they get fear. But what happens to that child is parents who love them  unconditionally come beside them and say it's okay. Here's what you need to do and they give them  tools and then they say we'll be with you. We're here and they support them and the child goes  through that circle and comes out on the other side with more tools, maturity, confidence and feeling  loved. Now here's what happens in complex trauma. You get to that trauma, you get to the danger,  the problems, nobody's there to show you how to do it. Nobody's there to support you. So you say,  I think I can figure this out and you head into the circle and you get hurt. You get hurt badly  and you run out. Then you face the next problem and you say, I think maybe I can figure this one out  and you head into the blue circle and you get hurt badly. Guess what happens after a while?  You say all problems, all danger, all pain is bad. Nothing good ever comes out of that. You only  get hurt. So the only thing to do whenever I face danger is fight, flight or freeze. So you don't  try to learn any tools because nobody's taught you tools and now because of fight, flight,  freeze you go, I think I found the perfect tool for dealing with problems and danger. I will fight,  flight, freeze. So here's what begins to happen. Let's say your belly button age, that's your  birthday, your physical age, is 40 years old. But at age 10, you reached a point in your life  or you said, nobody is helping me through problems. Fight, flight, freeze is my only way of coping  and at age 10, excuse me at age 10, you started coping, fight, flight, freeze is your main way  of dealing with life. You kept growing physically, you stopped growing emotionally. So you're  an 40 year old body but you're a 10 year old skill set. You're a 10 year old in your emotional  world. And that's one of the sad realities of complex trauma. Is it causes a child to stop growing  at a certain age? What recovery then is is saying, okay, I'm 40 years old but I'm really 10 years old.  I have to go back there and learn the skills I should have learned as a 10 year old. That feels  humiliating. That feels shameful. And a lot of people get angry about that. And you rightly  use should. But if you don't accept, I've got to go through this learning. I got to go back and  learn that. Then you're just going to get angry and you're not going to grow. Second thing I want  you to realize, you see the first arrow down says, FFF, fight, flight, freeze.  The greater the pain, the brain says, why do I wait till I'm in pain to fight, flight, freeze?  Let's see if we can find a solution to that. Let's back up our fight, flight, freeze, escape time  to anytime we feel uncomfortable. Anytime we feel uncomfortable emotions. So what we call that  in technical jargon is complex trauma people have distress intolerance. So as soon as they feel  any distress, I'm out of here. I'm not waiting around until there's a problem. I'm out of here  not just when I feel pain but now if I feel stress, if I feel embarrassed, if I feel a bit of anxiety,  I'm gone. So you backed up your escape hatch to any negative unpleasant emotion.  But then the brain goes, I don't like sitting in unpleasant emotions for very long.  Let's back it up even further. So now complex trauma people have a new title and it's called  hyper vigilance. And so now what you do when you come into a room, you're checking everybody out.  Are they safe? You've already checked me out probably and you've made your own conclusions but  that is what you're doing is looking for danger. But guess what you're doing? You've trained or  you're training your brain to look for problems so you stop seeing things accurately. You're zeroed  in on negative. And you train your brain to focus on negative. And many of you understand that  very well. But then your brain says, why should I wait for danger? Something now starts to get  distorted and this stops working. So anybody this way before I give you the final one,  the response of fight flight to trauma a one time event is what we call an adaptive system in the  body. That means the body quickly adapts to danger, gets through it, and then goes back to dealing  with life in a safe environment. So they don't have to be in fight flight mode. They don't have to  be in survival mode because they have got through the one time event and returned. What happens  in complex trauma? When you live in danger, you live in survival mode. You live in fight flight  freeze mode. And what does that mean? If I'm constantly in danger of getting hurt, don't trust  anybody. That helps you survive. But what does that do 20 years later when you try to have a  relationship with somebody? If you say, my number one rule is don't trust you never have a  healthy intimate relationship. So the very thing that kept you safe as a child in the moment  now is messing up your relationships. So an adaptive system has become mal adaptive. So let me do  that further. If I was to say to you, when you came in tonight, can I talk to you after we're  done tonight? Where did your brain go? You and the man able to hear a word I'm saying all night  because your brain went to, I wonder what I did wrong? That's a mal adaptive system. So what happens  now is you take everything that happens and you read negative into it. You jump to a worst  case scenario. They showed children from healthy homes and children from complex trauma homes  and pictures of faces. So they showed both of them a happy face, both kids said happy. They showed  a side face, both kids inside. They showed an angry case, angry face, both kids said angry. Then  they showed a blank face. What do you think the kids from complex trauma said? They're angry.  So they've learned to read danger into where danger isn't. So let me go back to that example.  If I said I would like to talk to you after we're done tonight, some of you would have said  he must be mad at me. He's going to chew me out about something. I've done something wrong. And  you would have gone into fight flight freeze and I'd never see you again because you're gone.  So what you just did is you just lost a good friend. All imagined in your mind,  you made it up. And so complex trauma takes a beautiful survival system and makes it work against  you. So the very things you're trying to avoid being hurt, being abandoned, what did you just  create? You abandoned me. You say all abandoned him before abandoned me. Same result you still end  up with abandonment. So you create what you're trying to prevent. And that's the tragedy of complex  trauma. So the very things that kept you safe in the moment now are hurting you. So another way  to say this complex trauma, you got wounded as a child, now you wound yourself. Or another way to  say it, studies have shown that people from complex trauma get adult life and they create their own  trauma. And they keep setting up danger in their life to keep hurting themselves. So what we're  going to look at over the next few months is a 50 fight flight freeze, things that come out of  complex trauma. So you're going to see some deal with how I see myself, some deal with how I cope  with stress, with sadness, with loss, all of those things, some will cover how I relate in  relationships. All of those are going to come out over the next few weeks tonight. We're only  going to do the first one. That's all we're going to have a chance for.  And this is one of the hardest ones to explain, but it's very important to understand. Because what  happens when you live in survival mode is without you realizing it, it changes your priorities.  And I'm going to explain that and develop it for you, but the priority that becomes number one is  safety. That matters more than anything else in your life, personal safety. But in order for that  to be number one, it had to bump down some other priorities. And so something changes without you  realizing it at your very core when those priorities change. So let me explain it as best I can and  I hope I'm clear. What happens when you're in danger? Safety becomes number one priority. But what  that means is a child that is worried about dad beating him up tonight or the babysitter sexually  abusing them. They're not thinking ahead with I so what they're thinking is right now. What do I  do right now tonight to stay safe? What do I got to do to stay safe? They're not thinking about if I  do this tonight, what will the consequences be in 10 years? That's stupid in their mind. Who cares?  I got to stay safe tonight. So it makes you base your decisions on immediate. And so with complex trauma,  two priorities come in immediate safety and grab any pleasure you can along the way because you're  not going to get a whole lot. So instant gratification becomes the two main priorities. But something  even deeper happens than that. When you're in danger, your safety is more important than loving  other people. Or put it another way. When I'm in a relationship and I feel danger, I matter more  now than the other person. My needs now are more important than the other person. My safety means  I will stab you in the back, throw you under the bus, lie to you, cheat on you, betray you,  because I got to stay safe. Your needs, you as a person, aren't as important right now as me.  So guess what is happening there? You are changing. So in a healthy home, what happens in  there is two things. Number one, people are equal. I love you. You love me. Your needs matter  just as much as my needs. I will make sacrifices at times to meet your needs. But if it's a good healthy  home, you will make sacrifices at times to meet my needs. And it'll be about a 50-50 thing. Secondly,  there is love as the number one priority. We will always treat each other with respect. We will  always tell the truth to each other. That's love by definition. You respect. You tell the truth.  We will accept each other. So love is what a child experiences in a healthy home. So they learn  to give and value people as equals. They give not to get. But they give knowing the other person  loves them as well. And so that is healthy. But here's what's happening in complex trauma.  My needs are becoming more important than your needs. Love now takes a backseat to my safety.  So I will love you only if I don't get hurt. But you're becoming a narcissist.  You know, a narcissist is. It's all about me. What I need right now matters more than what anybody  else needs. I am the most important person in the world right now. And that has to have priority  over whatever you want, whatever you need. So complex trauma without you even realizing it  turns you into a narcissist. In narcissists, it's kind of an ugly word. Let me give you an example.  Borderline personality disorder. You may not know that, but probably about 50% of you here have it.  You just haven't been diagnosed, but it goes like this. Borderline personality.  The main first criteria was these people don't like themselves very much. Number one, lots of  shame. Number two, they are emotional not jobs. If they get triggered, they go from zero to a thousand  in a nanosecond. And usually that's anger. And so they just are having a beautiful day.  Something happens. They lose it. And they've had a terrible day. And they hate themself for it.  Then they found this. What causes borderline personality is a fear of being abandoned.  And so as soon as they're in a circumstance where they fail, where they're rejected,  where they're disrespected, where somebody doesn't give them attention,  they start to fear abandonment. And what happens at that moment is they go crazy.  But what happens in the craziness? They are classic narcissists, which basically means  your world better start revolving around me. You better do it. I want you to do now or else.  And they become so self-centered, so selfish, why? Because the greatest pain in their life  has been abandonment. And now they're afraid it's going to happen again.  And they go narcissistic. And so what you're going to find is that everybody from complex trauma struggles  with, it's all about me. Addiction took that to a new level, where it was all about me all the time.  Now here's what will happen in recovery. You will begin to heal. And when you're in a good place,  it's not all about you. You're going to learn how to love. In narcissism, you don't love people. You  just use people. You use people to get what you want or what you need. But in recovery,  you begin to heal and learn how to love. And it's possible. It takes a lot of work, but it's  possible, but you're going to get triggered. Something will trigger your fear. And in that moment,  you'll become a narcissist again, or you'll be strongly tempted to become a narcissist again.  In that moment, that nanosecond when you're triggered, that is the most powerful force to try to stop.  It is like having rains on a team of eight horses that are determined to go that way,  and you're determined to stop them from going that way. It feels almost impossible.  The early days of recovery is starting to walk into that circle of problems, life, pain,  getting your fear triggered, wanting to go to fight, flight, or freeze, but saying,  no, it's different now. I've got tools I didn't have before. I got supports I didn't have before.  Let's calm her down, let's walk into it, and you get out the other side, and you go, hey,  that was good. Scare me to death, but I made it. And that is part of the journey.  All the research around complex trauma is making very clear. You can't do it alone.  You need a surrogate family. You need a new set of surrogate parents, people who will teach you the  skills, the toolbox that you never got. People that will support you as you start on this journey.  Now, I want to talk just to end this up. What does recovery look like? What's this healing from  complex trauma look like? Just imagine I got up here tonight, and I had my shirt button one button  down. So I didn't button up properly. It has happened before. How do I solve that problem? Do I just  take the top button off and fix it? No, the only way to fix a shirt that hasn't been buttoned up  properly? You got a totally unbuttoned and then buttoned up right. And you know, I know what happens  with complex trauma? You got to unbutton that shirt. You got to take that old toolbox with all  those old tools that kept you safe, but made your adult life a mess. And you say, I get rid of that,  and I got to start it square one and relearn how to live life. That's the challenge.  I would say in my life experience, healing from complex trauma is probably the most difficult  task anyone has been called to do. It takes total devotion, but it's possible. You can do it by yourself,  but with support it is possible. It is slow. It is sometimes very messy. Sometimes it's two steps  forward, one step back, but it is a journey that is possible. So to make that, I think you have  to start with humility. And what I mean by that is this, complex trauma turns people into a narcissist.  What does healthy look like? Humility. Now, that's not going around saying, I'm a piece of junk.  I'm no good. That's not humility. You might have been taught that.  All that humility means is I see life accurately. And what that means is you're equal with me.  You're just as important. We have different abilities, but we're just as important.  So I will treat you as an equal, and I will see myself as an equal, not as a piece of garbage.  It's really hard for people from complex trauma to get their head around humility,  because for many of you, if you humbled yourself as a child, and we're vulnerable,  open, honest, shared a struggle, you got humiliated. You got your nose rubbed in it.  You got made fun of. You got punished. You got picked on. And so in your mind, humility equals  humiliation. And so what you have to understand up front is I have to heal with safe people where  I can be humble. People, if I get humble, aren't going to humiliate me. People that aren't going  to blab it around. But if I'm with safe people, I can start to open up and be honest. I can be vulnerable.  I can start to see myself as having value, as being just as important as  and equal with everybody else. And as you develop healthy humility with healthy, safe people,  that's where the healing starts. If you come into recovery thinking, I'm better than everybody,  so I'm still going to be a narcissist, and I'm never going to admit all my struggles,  you're not going to do very well in this journey. If you come in saying, I'm such a terrible person,  I can't open up to anybody. You're going to stay stuck. So there's a risk that has to be taken.  And that is right up front, I will take the risk of choosing to check out some people to see if  they're safe. Then if I think they're safe, I would choose to trust them a little bit. And  in trusting them a little bit, I'll open up a little bit. And that's the healing process,  and that's where it begins.
