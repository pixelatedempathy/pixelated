Instead of beating yourself up and say, oh, I got to stop this approval seeking or attention seeking. Why do I do that? Where does this come from? So kind of three big things that come out of complex trauma. So number one, it's parents that weren't attuned to the child's emotional needs. And so your emotional needs were not seen and therefore met. So secondly, that's another way of saying you experience some type of neglect. You did not receive the attention you should have from your parents. It could be they were workaholics. It could be they were narcissists. Could be they were very insecure driven. Or it could be not that they did it intentionally, but you were in a very large family. Or they had their own family business and it demanded all of their time. Or they had chronic health problems or mental health problems. And they just weren't able to be there for you. Another part of this is every child needs validation. That's one of our emotional needs. They need to be told you're good at that. Hey, you are this way. You did a great job there. That's how a child learns who they are. That's how a child begins to get a good positive self-identity. But some parents grew up in an era where they were told that if you validated your children, they would get a big head. They would become proud. They would get a big ego. And so parents purposely didn't validate their children wanting to keep them humble. But it had the reverse effect. It created shame. So based on inaccurate teaching, parents often did not validate their children sufficiently. So what happens for a child whose need for validation is not met in a consistent way is they can go in one of two directions. So they can suppress the need for validation. So basically that means suppress. They can suppress all of my needs. Because if I express my needs, and I should get validation, but rather I get rejection, I get punishment, in other words I get pain, therefore let's become invisible. Let's not need validation. Let's not have needs. Let's make no demands. So children like this often become invisible children. They develop a rich fantasy world. They become a loner. They become self-sufficient. That's what they need to do to not go through the pain of not being validated. Now the challenge, if I can give as an aside, for many invisible children, when they come into recovery, is that when they begin to realize, I need to make myself visible. I need to put my needs out there. I need to express my desires. I need to try things and do things. All of a sudden they feel guilty. All of a sudden fear kicks in. I'm going to get rejected. I'm going to get judged. I'm going to get punished. And so for them to come out of invisibility into healthy expression of needs creates tremendous fear. It is a very difficult thing. And they often feel guilty doing that. So just be aware of that. But the second thing that can happen when a child is not validated is that they then go to developing a hyper need for validation. A hyper need for approval. A hyper need for recognition. It becomes this black hole that can never be satisfied. An itch that just can't be scratched sufficiently. So with attention seeking, this is so important to understand. A child that is neglected, they will do things to gain attention. They will make attention seeking behaviors. It's not to be bad. It's because they want to connect. It's a bid for connection. It's please notice me so that you will connect with me. So it's driven by this huge need for connection that every child has. But if the parents don't connect and then judge the child for the attention seeking behavior, the child begins to go, I'm bad. Nobody wants me because I'm not good enough. So shame develops. This deep self identity that sees itself as negative. That sees itself as bad, unlovable, not good enough. And so then what comes out of that is, but I still want to connect. I still want to be seen. I still want to be noticed. So I don't care if it's in a good way anymore. I just want to be seen. Hopefully people will connect. But if they don't, oh well, I just need to be seen. So now attention seeking behavior can go into very many maladaptive forms. Just wanting to be noticed. And for some kids it can develop into almost rebellion. I am going to go to maladaptive attention seeking things because I know my parents get mad at me for that. And that's going to pay them back for not giving me healthy attention. So the attention seeking is a hyper need because of lack of validation, healthy validation. The approval seeking, if you look at the shame that has developed, that I must not be good enough, I must not be good enough. And the child then doesn't have any positive feelings towards himself. But they want to be loved. They want to be approved. They want to feel good. So they can't give that to themselves. So they go looking to please others. To gain others approval as a solution to their shame. So that is where this comes from. Now let me just show you some of the other things that parents can do that create this attention approval seeking life trap. So many parents will place kind of in a shame type of culture. They place tons of importance on what other people think of them. So they are always concerned with outward appearances or keeping up appearances. So you got to act a certain way, dress a certain way, talk a certain way, have certain manners, do certain things in public in order to gain the approval of others. It's all about being approved by others. So a child growing up in that, when they want to dress the way that suits them, that is comfortable to them, when they want to engage in certain hobbies or sports or activities, the parents are going, but is that going to be approved by the culture or the people I know in my culture? If not, no, you can't do that. You can't wear that. No, you can't have that activity. So the child's life is not guided by their abilities, their drives, their desires. It's guided by keeping up appearances, getting the approval of the culture. And so that then is a parent who can have this life trap themself. That their life is all based on gaining approval. So their life is all about image. It's all about status. It's all about success. It's all about material possessions. It's all about money. It's all about externals. That is the guiding factor in their parent's life. And the child then is brought into that world and tried to get squeezed into that mold. Another thing that can happen is that children grow up where parents only validate them when they do what the parents do. When they do what the parents want. When they please the parents. And so if their parents are narcissists, if their parents are all about image and externals, they're going to get validation for being pretty. They're going to get validation for being the smartest kid in the class, the best athlete. They're not going to get validated for what really matters in life. They're only going to get validated for what fits the parent's value system. What the parents deem as the marks of success. Other children, if they grew up with abuse, if they grew up with bullying, if they grew up with abandonment issues, they're going to get shame through those avenues. And so then, what happens with shame? I need others to approve me. I need others to see me. And so mainly neglect can bring it. But abuse and abandonment can also bring this about because it produces the same shame issue. Another thing that can happen for many children is they might have got little bits of validation, but the predominant thing they got from their parents was criticism, judgment. They were always finding fault with everything they did. Nothing they did was ever good enough. And so the child was just driven to try to get approval, to be desperate for approval. Another one is if you had a parent who was a narcissist. They were living this life trap out in their own life. And so that was your role model. That was your normal. And that's what you grew up with and you developed. Another common thing that happens within complex trauma is children begin to realize they're kind of viewed as a perfect doll. And so they're pretty, they're well behaved, they're pleasing. They're kind of like a pretty doll on a shelf that everybody just admires. Everybody just sees them a certain way. They see them based on their physical behaviors and their physical appearance. Nobody actually sees the real them for who they really are. They only see the externals and then assume that this is who they are. But actually they see them through a fantasy lens of who they want them to be. And so many children kind of get put in that perfect doll role. You got to look a certain way, act a certain way, and be this way because then we will admire you. Then we will... And they act like they see you all the time because they give you so much attention, but they don't really see you. They see you through a fantasy lens, who they want you to be. Some children are given by their parents roles. So in complex trauma, we talk about children developing roles to try to not get hurt, to try to get their needs met, to try to fix the family. But sometimes in complex trauma, children are assigned roles without even being told they're assigned roles. They just gradually pick up that they're expected to live a certain way. So some are expected to be there. They're expected to be the hero. But some children are assigned the role or expected to be invisible. That you're going to be the child that never makes demands. You're going to be the child that's going to be the flower on the wall. That's just there, pretty, no demands, invisible. And so many children have grown up feeling that subtle, constant expectation that they're never to draw attention to themselves, never to express needs, never to make demands, never be a burden. That's just what was passed on to them. Others, they had a sibling who was put into the hero role or the comedian role. And they got tons of validation from everybody for being such a wonderful child, for being so funny. But you weren't assigned the comedian role or the hero role. So you didn't get any validation. Some children, they learned that the only way they would get noticed was not by being good, by not doing positive things. Their parents wouldn't give them validation for that. So the only way they would get noticed is by being bad, by creating a crisis, by doing stuff the parents didn't want them to do. Then all of a sudden they got the attention they were seeking, the attention they would not get by being good. Some children were only validated for one thing. Their brains, their looks, their body, their being funny, their being good at sports. And so when they realized, okay, I don't get any validation in life except for my athletic ability, my brains, my looks. They then made this commitment. I am going to be a pro. I am going to be the best at this. I am going to put all my effort and all my attention into developing this ability. Because in their mind, that's the only place their value came from. And so they were going to get it to have maximum value. And that became their obsession. So what I want you to see is that all of these things, can you see the shame component? All of the stuff that came out of neglect, not being validated, produced shame. Now all the other things that the parents did produced shame. So shame is the underlying element here. And so approval seeking, attention seeking, is all driven by shame. It's all trying to solve shame. But it doesn't work. So shame is this underlying issue. So instead of it working to solve shame, instead of it working to get positive validation, to get positive admiration, it begins to have the opposite effect. So we talked about, you begin to not know who you are, because you're trying to please everybody else and be what they want. So you lose your sense of identity. You don't even know what your needs are, what your thoughts are, your feelings are after a while. Then you're not able to truly connect with people, because true connection requires authenticity. And you don't know what that is. And so you begin to realize that your relationships are all rather superficial. Then people start getting tired of you always wanting approval or seeking attention. And they stop giving it to you. They set boundaries. They end the relationship, because you're wearing them out. Sometimes people begin to realize they're doing things for attention or approval that actually goes against their own deep values and beliefs. So now they're being hypocrites. Now they're doing stuff that's causing them to feel guilty. And it creates deeper and deeper insecurity. Because all of my good feelings are dependent on others now. And I'm always worried about, are they going to approve today? What do they think about this? What about that? Deeper and deeper insecurity, which causes deeper and deeper stress. In everyday life.
