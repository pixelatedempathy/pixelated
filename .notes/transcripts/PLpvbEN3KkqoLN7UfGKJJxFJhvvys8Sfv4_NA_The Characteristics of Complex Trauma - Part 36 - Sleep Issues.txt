 Welcome to another Friday night. I want to talk tonight about an issue that many people  with complex trauma struggle with and that sleep. And what we're finding just in the West  in general is that sleep issues is becoming more and more of a common thing that is being  talked about. But what is being discovered is that most people with more severe complex  trauma have sleep issues. It's just a big issue that comes out of complex trauma. Let  me just read this quote. Compared to adults with few or no adverse childhood experiences  or aces, adults with a significant amount of childhood trauma are more than twice as  likely to have trouble falling asleep or also twice as likely to feel tired after a  fallnight sleep. The effects of aces on sleep can last up to 50 years with each aces increasing  the risk of inadequate sleep as an adult by 20%. So if you have one aces, one adverse  childhood experience, sleep difficulties increases by 20%. If you have two, 40%, three,  one on and on. In an adult patient diagnosed with insomnia, those with a high number of  aces wake up more often during the night and have more disturbed sleep than those with  few or no aces. So the bottom line is complex trauma has a significant effect on sleep.  So the purpose of this talk is not to provide some magic solution to automatically make  you sleep perfectly. But it's to provide you with some information that I hope will help  you start to see some improvement in your sleep. And the bottom line is going to be this.  What I have seen is that the more people work on their complex trauma to heal it, to really  deal with it, the more they start to see their sleep improved. It's a very gradual process,  but it does happen. So the purpose of this talk is really to help you understand your sleep  problems so that you can see the connection between your sleep problems and the complex  trauma and to give you some things that could help. So two possible comes if you're really  working on your trauma. You might option one, see your sleep problems just disappear. All  of a sudden something changes, sleep is no longer an issue. For others, you might see some  improvement in your sleep, but it doesn't totally go away. And so what you begin to realize is that  you're probably going to have to live with some sleep issues for the rest of your life. They  are improving a bit, but they're still there and you just got to learn to manage it. So for my  own life, after I burnt myself out 30 years ago, sleep has just been an issue for me ever since.  The more I've learned about complex trauma, the more I've worked on myself and healed, the more  I've seen my sleep improve, but it's still a daily ongoing thing that I have to work at. And what  really I want you to hear at the very beginning, when I burned myself out, what I began to realize is if  I was going to rebuild a healthy life, one of the main building blocks had to be consistent, healthy  sleep. If I wasn't getting healthy, consistent sleep, all of my symptoms would start coming back. I  would start going downhill again. And it was just realizing, wow, we take sleep for granite, but sleep  is a vital part of a healthy life. It's a vital part, not just of a physically healthy life, but of an  emotionally healthy life, a mentally healthy life, all aspects of life are affected by sleep.  And so for many people who struggle with sleep, they understand that. This is such a frustrating  thing for them. So let's move into just kind of building an understanding of sleep. And so let's  look at what normal sleep looks like. And so lots of sleep institutes, sleep studies are done today.  We've grown so much in our understanding of sleep. So basically what is coming out of all the  research that's happening nowadays is that sleep is not uniform. It's not you fall asleep and then  you just sleep uniformly through the night. Basically, two things to be aware of. There's four  stages in your sleep cycle. But then you go through four to six cycles of that a night.  And so a person falls asleep, goes through a cycle, goes through a second cycle, goes through a  third cycle. So that is what we're learning is happening while you sleep. So the four stages in  the sleep cycle is so N1, the yellow is you start getting drowsy and that's usually minute to 10  minutes that you're falling asleep. So your heart rate is slowing down, your brain is slowing down,  your breathing is slowing. Then you go into N2 which is the light sleep phase and that can be 10 to  60 minutes. And then you go to your deep sleep phase which is 20 to 40 minutes and then you go to  REM sleep which is your vivid dreaming which can be 10 to 60 minutes. Now what's significant next is  to realize that each stage, so you go through the cycle but you're going through it four to six  times a night. So each time you go through it, it's a bit different. So the first time you go through  it, you'll see that you go through the N1 down to the N2 and then there's quite a long period of  the deep sleep and there's just a very small amount of REM sleep in the very, in the first time you go  through the cycle. Then the second time you go through deep sleep again, REM sleep gets a bit longer.  Third time you go through, you don't go into the deep sleep but you get longer REM sleep. Then the  fourth time, longer REM sleep, fifth time, longer REM sleep. So another way to look at it, this is through  these bar graph and that is you're going through the N1, the yellow, then you go to the light sleep  and the first time through the first set of bars on the left, you get a very wide baby blue which  is your deep sleep and then a very small amount of REM sleep but each time you go through you get  less deep sleep, more REM sleep and that's how the night progresses and you can see kind of the  hours on the clock as you move through and even a night if you went to bed around 10 o'clock and  got up at 6. So not all sleep cycles are the same length. It's normal for sleep cycles to change  as you progress through your nightly sleep. The first sleep cycle is often the shortest,  ranging from 70 to 100 minutes while the later sleep cycles tend to fall between 90 and 120 minutes,  two hours. In addition, the composition of each cycle, how much time is spent in each stage, changes as  the night goes along and that can vary from person to person, that can vary from night to night,  it's based on a whole wide range of factors, it's dependent on your age, your recent sleep patterns,  medication, alcohol consumption, all kinds of different things. Most adults need 7 to 8 hours of  sleep a night. So again, it's not a solid 8 hours. You go through the rhythms and so what can  happen for many people with complex traumas you go through stage one and then for most people,  they wouldn't come fully awake, they just go back to a light sleep and then go into phase two  and the four cycles. Some people with complex trauma, they go through phase one and they become  fully awake and then it takes them a while to go back and fall asleep again and go into phase two  and that's where they can get extremely frustrated because they're in the middle of the night  and they're wide awake and then they start getting angry about it and that just prevents them from  going to sleep. And so it's the things that can interrupt the transition from one phase to a  next that become significant for some people. So let me give you some sleep stats.  So insomnia is more common in neurological disorders than in the general population. So people with  ADHD, depression, anxiety, epilepsy, migraines, eating disorders. Notice how much many of those are  trauma-related issues. So the recognizing insomnia is worse for people with trauma issues.  One in three Americans report regularly sleeping less than seven hours a night. A third of Americans  aren't getting as much sleep as they should and what is important to understand is when a person  is not getting enough sleep. You don't usually see the consequences of that immediately.  It takes a while for it to take its toll and it's down the road a bit before you begin to actually  realize the full effect of that lack of sleep on a person. At least 40 million Americans have a  long-term sleep disorder. So that's over 10% of the population. And again, what all the research  is showing is healthy sleep is foundational to a healthy life. It is a key building block.  Foundation stone, everything else is connected to getting good sleep. What is the purpose of sleep?  Why do we need this sleep? And what you're going to see is it's when our parasympathetic nervous system  can come fully on board. When we go into the deep sleep, the REM sleep. And that's when the body  does its healing and restoring work. And so people who have good sleep, sleep cleans out toxins  in the brain cells. It repairs damages, damaged tissues. So all kinds of healing is happening in the  body and brain. But sleep also is key to helping us learn and to preserving memories and storing  memories into the long term. It regulates hormones. So there's a balancing thing again that comes with  the parasympathetic nervous system. It then leads to better being able to manage your emotions  and behavior because you're rested. Your bodies in a better place, your brains in a better place.  And so you're able to regulate better emotionally. So sleep has many benefits. And I think we're still  learning about this but what we're learning is just fascinating and we see this is such an important  part of our life. Now let's say you were having trouble sleeping and you went to the doctor  and what would he look for if he was going to diagnose sleep disorder? So long periods of  not breathing once you go to sleep or excessive daytime sleepiness. You're just sleepy all the time  or you really snore, have snoring issues and that keeps waking you up or you're restless while you're  sleeping. You're just thrashing constantly. So your legs, all of that are thrashing or irregular  breathing, difficulty falling asleep, headaches once you wake up, consistent nightmares or physical  reactions to dreams. So those would be the things that are considered symptoms of sleep disorders.  So let me give you the types of sleep disorders. So insomnia is kind of the the general one that  most would relate to. And so what again they're finding is it's connected to depression, anxiety,  stress or pain. And most of that is related to trauma. So it's considered acute insomnia if it  lasts one night to a few weeks. So if you have trouble sleeping for several weeks in a row then it's  acute. It's considered chronic. If you at least three nights a week for three months you have trouble  sleeping. Then there's obstructive sleep apnea. Something is blocking your ability to breathe clearly.  But then there's one that's central sleep apnea. This is rare but it's really important to  understand because it's got a link to opioid use. And what happens basically is the person stops breathing  but the brain doesn't send the message to start the breathing process again. It doesn't prompt  the diaphragm to engage. Something's happened in that link. And that can be tied opioid use and it's  also associated with congestive heart failure or prior to a stroke. Then restless leg syndrome is  another one or another one called periodic limb movement disorder which would be leg cramps that  wake you up in the night. Then teeth grinding, snoring, then circadian rhythm disorders which  are often connected to people who work shift work. So there's circadian rhythms are just out of  whack because they're sleeping at different times depending on their shift. Then there's parasomnius.  And that's abnormal movements in the night due to health or emotional issues. So sleep walking,  sleep terrors, sleep talking, confusional arousal. So you wake up totally confused.  Sleep related eating disorder, sleep and your recess of bed wetting beyond the age of five.  And then sleep related hallucinations. So those are all the different types of sleep disorders.  What are the possible causes? So it could be a person's weight which can result in apnea.  It can be like we said mental health, trauma, depression, mental illness and stress,  shift work, hormonal changes and women can cause lots of sleep issues, travel, different time zones,  different beds, different environments, then environmental conditions. And that can include  being on your computer too much into the night and all of the effects of the screen light.  Then second hand sleep issues. So you've got children sleeping with you. You've got a partner that  snores. You've got dogs that get into the bed with you and are up moving around in the night.  Or it could be medications that side effects affect your sleep or it could be recreational  drugs. So we know that too much alcohol can affect your sleep. So what happens if a person  doesn't get enough sleep? It can increase your risk of obesity, diabetes, depression.  So lots of health issues can come out of lack of sleep. Then it can begin to affect your ability to  learn. It can begin to affect your emotional state and behavioral issues. All of that come out  of lack of sleep. Your immune system becomes weakened because your parasympathetic nervous system  is not working the way it should. Then you're at a increased risk for work accidents or car accidents  because you're not as sharp, you're not as alert. And then relationship conflict. She just  don't have the emotional bandwidth capacity to handle problems, to handle annoyances.  And so there's just more relationship problems. Mental health issues. Let me read you a couple  quotes. Individuals who have trouble sleeping are greater risk for mental health issues.  A single night of tossing and turning can increase feelings of anger, irritability,  anxiousness, stress or sadness the next morning. Another one. Over time, sleep problems can  lead to a higher risk of depression, ADD, ADHD, panic attacks, brain fog, psychosis, memory problems  and dementia. Alarming statistics reported in scientific Americans show that teenagers who  sleep just an hour less per night than the average are 38% more likely to feel sad and hopeless,  42% more likely to consider suicide, 58% more likely to attempt suicide, and 23% more likely to  engage in substance abuse. That's pretty big groundifications, especially for teenagers.  In 2019, a study in American Journal of Public Health points to a 33% increase risk of depression  among shift workers compared with the general population, just because they're circadian rhythms  out of whack and they're not sleeping as well. So let me now bring all of this to the trauma  and just specific details of why the sleep issues come out of trauma. Let me give you 10 different  things. So number one, when a person's in complex trauma, constant danger, there's cortisol  happening in the brain on an ongoing basis. Typically, the way cortisol was designed to work is it  would come in a short blast to give you energy to fight or flight. Then you would get to safety  and then you would tense up and shake and release the cortisol and then that situation was  resolved. Complex trauma, the cortisol keeps pumping, your body can't release the cortisol,  and that cortisol that stays within the body begins to affect how it functions in negative ways.  And one of them is there's just all of this built up energy that can't be released,  energy that was for fight or flight. But now you can't release it. And so it's trouble,  you have trouble sleeping because you got all this energy just wanting to be burned.  Secondly, complex trauma, when that constant danger you're in your sympathetic nervous system  all the time. It is activated. And once your sympathetic nervous system is activated during  high alert, you don't want to relax, you don't want to drop your guard. And so sleep  happens in your parasympathetic nervous system. Good sleep. And so when you're in your  sympathetic nervous system all the time, sleep is difficult. Third, for many people with complex  trauma, the brain develops the ability to try and detect danger so it becomes hyper vigilant.  Once a person becomes hyper vigilance, you train yourself to always be alert,  always be aware. And that makes sleep difficult. But some have even trained themselves  that even when they go to sleep, they only allow themselves to go into a light sleep.  They can't allow themselves to go to a deep sleep because then they wouldn't be alert.  So that hyper vigilance is key. And then what's connected to that is the fear that if I go into a  deep sleep, I will lose control. I will not be in control. My circumstances, my situation and  something bad could happen. So deep sleep equals lack of control. So never go to deep sleep.  So that's significant stuff that's coming out of trauma that affects sleep.  Then for some who've got sexual abuse, other types of abuse, horrific accidents,  those can turn into nightmares. Those can turn into distressing dreams that wake you up and  prevent you from going back to sleep. Another thing that happens for many children from complex  trauma is that their life was very chaotic. It was not a routine. So their parents just then put  the kids to bed at a consistent time. Their parents weren't organized. Their parents didn't have a  bedtime routine. So the kids went to bed at all kinds of different times with no consistency.  Parents would take their children out to the bars because they didn't want to get a babysitter.  And so the kids would be there until two in the morning while their parents drank and partied.  Or parents would have people over to their house to party who would be up all the night,  hooting and hollering and making noise. And so sleep was just not happening. Or they had parents  who were fighting all the time, often at night after the kids went to bed. So it was yelling and  screaming and hitting. And so sleep just was not there. It not consistent. And they didn't get  enough hours of sleep. Sadly for many people from complex trauma going to bed was going to a dangerous  place because that's when the predators came. When you went to bed, sexual predators. And so just  the idea going to bed creates anxiety. That's the most dangerous place in the world. And so for many  people coming out of complex trauma, when they go to bed now, they go to hyper alert. So they will  only go to sleep if they have their back against the wall. So there's nobody behind them. If they're  facing the door. So they're looking at the only access point and they have a weapon nearby.  So they're prepared if anybody comes in and they can still be doing that years later.  That's how deeply it affected them. Then for some, they had the early effects of trauma in their  physical illness stuff. So they might have had asthma, axima, physical pain issues, other kind of  health-related stress health issues that make sleep difficult. So allergies, asthma, hard to breathe,  hard to sleep. And that comes out of complex trauma. Then for others, what came out of complex  trauma for them and their hyper vigilance is that their five senses became hyper alert. So now  they're very sensitive to noise, too light. And so for them to go to sleep now, they hear every little  noise. And so they can only sleep with ear plugs. They can only sleep with a noise machine, white  noise machine, because their five senses are just hyper alert. And then let me read you this.  Trauma can affect sleep architecture, which means that it can change how the body moves  through the sleep cycles and stages. Experts are working to understand the ways trauma  alters sleep architecture. But research suggests that rapid eye movement sleep or the REM stage  appears to be the stage most affected. REM sleep is important for restoring memories and processing  emotions and dreams during REM sleep for people with complex trauma tend to be more fantastical  and bizarre. So hopefully that explains some of your sleep stuff. But now what do you do about it?  So I want to give you kind of some of the medical stuff but then some very practical tools  that everybody can do. So some people with apnea need to get a CPOP or a B-POP machine that helps them  consistently breathe. Bright light therapy is a therapy that they're finding can help people with  sleep issues. Then oral devices in your mouth that keep the airways open. Some actually need surgery  in order to free up the airways more. And then there's some medications that you can help  and I'll talk about that more later. From a psychological perspective, there's a thing called CBTI.  So cognitive behavior therapy for insomnia. And so again some are finding that to be beneficial.  Let me just say the bottom line again is what I have seen is the more people heal from their trauma,  the more they start to see gradual improvement in sleep. So it's not a quick fix. It's just a gradual  thing and it's the byproduct of focusing on the trauma. So it's not even focusing on the sleep so  much. It's focusing on the trauma. But then there is definitely sleep hygiene. So things that you can do  on a daily basis to help improve your possibilities of a good night's sleep. So number one,  you got to make sleep a priority. And that means you got to go to bed at the same time every night.  So have a consistent sleep schedule that you stick to. Many people need to turn off their digital  devices at least an hour before bedtime. Because what we know is the light from your phone screen,  your computer screen, it activates the brain and the sympathetic nervous system. So turn off devices.  Third, keep intensity out of your evenings as much as possible. So limit the number of meetings  that you would go to. That would get you kind of worked up. Intense stressed. Limit intense  conversations in the evening. Limit high energy socializing in the evening. They just get you all  wired. And then it's too hard to unwind and go to sleep. So try to make evenings about engaging  in relaxing activities. Then watch your liquid intake. Don't drink a lot of liquid in the evening  because then you're up in the night peeing. Also, what they're finding is if you eat a lot of food  late at night, that disrupts your sleep pattern. So if you eat earlier, then your body can have it  digested to the point that you're going to sleep well. So just the time of your evening meal can  play a significant role in your sleep pattern. Pay attention to your diet because what you eat  also affects your sleep pattern. So just be aware of that. And again, there's tons of information  about this on the internet, on Instagram, YouTube, if you want to get more information. Alcohol  the later in the evening you drink, it might help you fall asleep, but it disrupts the later  stages of your sleep pattern, especially the REM sleep stage. So be aware of your alcohol consumption,  especially in the evening. Limit, napping during the day. So napping is fine as long as it's not too  long during the day. So be aware of that. Make sure when you go to bed that you feel safe,  because that is huge, is that you need to feel safe. Being in a hot, sticky bedroom makes it  really hard to sleep. Being in a bedroom where there's just lots of light coming in, the windows  makes it hard to sleep. So try to have a cool dark space for sleeping. And then don't try to  force sleep. So if you don't fall asleep in the first 15 minutes to half an hour, some people instead  of getting angry and frustrated, which is only going to make it worse, just get up, do something  for a bit, kind of reset, and then go back to bed. So you're going to have to figure out what works  for you. Others just go, oh well, I'll fall asleep when I fall asleep. And I'll just lie here and  not get upset about it. So the key is figure out what works for you, but don't get  frustrated and upset. Many people are finding that meditation, prayer, before bedtime  can reduce stress, help them unwind from the day, help them get to their parasympathetic nervous  system. And so meditation becomes an important key in preparing them for sleep. And there's lots  of meditations that are now available that are actually to help people prepare for sleep, breathing.  So deep breathing exercises helps get to the parasympathetic nervous system. And so many people find  breathing exercises before they go to bed to be very helpful. Others find yoga during the day  is very helpful in just helping them have better sleep. Some use white noise machines,  others have kind of ocean wave sounds in their ear as a very soothing type of sound that helps  them sleep better. Progressive muscle relaxation. So you tense up your muscles and then you release  them. And that helps release cortisol. That helps you get out of your sympathetic into your  parasympathetic. And what many find is once they tense up and release, they automatically start  yawning. And so there's some stuff going on that stuff is being released.  Somatic exercises that stimulate the vagus nerve and help you then move to your parasympathetic nervous  system. So a couple things. And there's all kinds. And again, you can find them on the internet.  But a couple that are to me significant is if you lie on your back and put your feet, elevate your  feet above you. So your feet are kind of up the wall or up on a stool. That actually engages  your vagus nerve and then your parasympathetic nervous system. These are three pressure points  that help engage your vagus nerve. So the one I like is the one where you push a couple inches  down from your wrist right in the soft spot. And if you hold it for about 60 seconds and then you  pulse it for another 60 seconds, that really engages your vagus nerve. Then there's another pressure  point below your knee. So again, there's stuff on Instagram if you want to get more information on  that. But it's realizing that there are different pressure points that can be used that help stimulate  the vagus nerve. And then there's earthing. So at the bottom of your feet are different vagus nerve  points. And so by walking in your bare feet or by getting reflexology where you get pressure  put on your feet and feet massages, those help engage your vagus nerve. So you can try different  things and see what helps you. Some people find that hypnosis helps them with sleep and learn how  to do some self-hypnosis to bring about a state of calm so they can fall asleep. Others find that  supplements that are non-addictive, so nutraceuticals such as magnesium, melatonin, GABA,  5HTP, and I Theonine help them have better sleep. When it comes to sleep medication, alcohol. So like I  said, alcohol can help you fall asleep, but it can then really mess up your sleep. Sleep medication.  So there's different types. So there's benzodiazepines, which is your laryzapam, laryzapams, your  pams. Then certain antidepressants like trisodone and the triptoline help with sleep. Then there's  your narcotic medications and then CBD oils that can help with sleep. So for some people they hit a  point of just total burnout, total insomnia that they need medication to try to get their bodies  some rest, to try to retrain their sleep systems in their body, and that's a very necessary  important thing. Other people, if they're traveling, know that they're going to need some medication  while they travel if they're ever going to get through the trip. So there's a time and place for  some medication, but be aware that for your pams for your narcotic based sleep medication,  after about two weeks your body begins to develop a tolerance or a dependence on them.  And so then they have less and less effectiveness and then to get off of them means sleepless nights.  And so just be aware that there's some dangers there. Then for others, be aware that there's  side effects. So amni-tripling trisodone, there can be some side effects that just are not  fun, dry mouth, foggy brain, bad dreams, all of those kinds of things. So again, don't focus on  medication as the solution. It might be necessary at times. Focus on getting the other things  in order in your life, to really developing healthy sleep hygiene, dealing with your trauma,  being aware during the day of where's my stress at, and watching that you don't get your stress  too high, because that's what's going to mess up your sleep. So I really hope I can,  this is giving you just a little bit of insight and some tools to help you, because this sleep  thing is so important. If you can't sleep, well, it becomes a massive discouraging, frustrating issue.  Well, that's the end of another Friday night. Thank you so much for being with us.  Have a great weekend. We'll see you in a minute.
