Because that will give you proof that somebody loves you, so you must be lovable.  What then is the problem if you are not in a relationship?  And you are alone.  Your brain goes, -oh, this is proof I am not lovable.

Therefore, I have got to run into a relationship.  So that's why many shame-based people, when they feel that their relationship is falling apart, they do not just break it off and sit alone for a while.  They do not break it off until they have somebody else ready.  Because they cannot be alone because that would prove their deepest fear that they are not lovable.  So here's how it works out.  So you have got shame in the rectangle on the left, the blue rectangle.  Then people respond to shame in different ways.  So some people respond by going to the gray oval at the bottom, the inferior position.  I am a nobody.  I am no good.  And they just walk around with zero self-image.  Others respond by trying to compensate.  And they, they act like they are better than everybody.  And they go in the direction of being a narcissist.  Okay?  So what you need to understand is those two people find each other.  Because what does the superior person want?  To fix their shame?  Not just that I walk around feeling better.  I need people to tell me I am better than others.  So I need to rescue people.  I need to find people who are messed up and help them out.  Because what do I, what do they do when I help them out?  They say, you are so wonderful.  You are fantastic.  And that heals their shame, they think.  And then how does it help the person who feels inferior to stay that way?  Well, there's always a knight in shining armor that's going to come around to rescue them.  And when they come and rescue them, they go, I am going to give you all my time.  You are worth it.  Here's some gifts.

Let me spend time with you and do stuff for you.  And they go, I get so much attention from being inferior.  This is solving my shame.  So it all starts great.  It all looks like it's going to solve the shame.

Now, just one thing before I go to the next slide.  In the beginning, the superior person sacrifices all their needs for this inferior person.  They make the inferior person the center of their universe.  Okay?

But that's about to change.  Because what happens once they do that, the superior's rescuing the inferior, the inferior's feeling rescued, and they are both feeling good, but they are not dealing with their shame in a meaningful way.  So they are both discontent at a deep level.  And so pretty soon, this superior person starts to get annoyed with the inferior person and say, why do not you carry your weight around here?  I am tired of doing everything for you.  And all of a sudden, he makes himself the center of the universe.  And the other person has to give up all their rights and needs and take care of them.  And then the inferior person, they go, why am I not getting the attention I used to get?  And they start pouting and whining and creating crisis to try to draw the other person back.  And you get more and more tension.  And then the superior person, they start getting abusive.  They start getting controlling.  They start thinking, the way to get all the love that I need is to cut everybody else out of that person's life so I am the only one left.  Then they will give me all the love I need.  So they try to isolate them from all their friends and family, trying to solve their shame.  And then the relationship is drifting.  It's falling apart.  And both of them start to feel, I have been too demanding, I have been too needy.  I need to do more things for them.  And they become a caretaker and they give up more and more of their rights.

But it's not solving shame.  And the relationship keeps breaking down.  What I want you to see is as long as shame is not dealt with, you are going to see that they are not going to be able to solve their shame.  And that's because they are not going to be able to solve their shame.  So you are going to see that they are going to be able to solve their shame.  So what can happen when a person is not dealt with?  You can never have a healthy relationship.  Shame has to be dealt with to some degree and both people have to be dealing with their shame in order for a relationship to have any chance to get healthy.  So what can happen with a superior person when they get the inferior person?  So let's just say the inferior person was you as an addict.  They go, there's proof that you are sick and I do not have any shame.  I am superior to you.  I am helping you out.  I am a saint.  I am a wonderful person.  I should have angel wings growing out of my back.  I have zero shame.  Do you realize they got just as much shame as the other one?  They are just hiding it better.  And so at some point if they do not start to see that they have shame too, they will keep needing the other person to be inferior.  So if the inferior person starts to deal with their shame and get healthy, that messes up the way the superior person wants this to operate.  And they are not getting the applause that they used to get.  So they need to sabotage that person's recovery and make them sick again so they get the praise that they need.  They need to feed the monster.  And it does not work.  So here's some of the extreme things that happen.  For the inferior person, they become super needy, super clingy.  I do not want to lose you.  I do not want to lose you.  So all of a sudden they got all kinds of needs.  Some go to a Munchausen syndrome where every day they got a new crisis, a new pain, a new sickness.  I got cancer today.  I got arthritis tomorrow.  And I keep drawing you back in to give me attention.  Or they can go to creating drama.  Crisis after crisis.  Or they can go to the other extreme.

Let me just take care of you.  Then you will love me because I am so wonderful to you.  I will do extra things for you.  I will make more sacrifices for you.  Just love me.  Shame trying to get a solution, but it never works.  For the superior person, they can just cut off the relationship and move on.  Or some, that would be failure.  So they get Munchausen syndrome by proxy.  I will poison you and make you sick so that you get rushed to the hospital and then I will come rushing in to rescue you.  And people do that.  And you can watch Netflix stuff about that.  That is a real thing that happens.  Some parents do it with children so that the child still needs the parent as much as they did when they were really little.  All a desperate attempt to still be the hero in that person's life.  So those are things that begin to happen out of shame.  I am going to save the last two until next time.

But I hope that just gives you a little bit of insight into this.  Shame is not just some innocent little thing that's not a big deal.  Shame at the core of your being affects everything.  Shame is not just some innocent little thing that affects everything in your life negatively.  That's what I want you to understand.  And once you understand that you begin to realize it affects me but it affects my relationships and it sets up my relationships to fail.  And so I need to deal with this shame if I am going to be healthy, if I am going to have a healthy relationship with my kids, with my partner, with my friends.  That's how big a deal it is.  So for the Christian part I want you to think of shame in terms of how does it affect a person's relationship with God.  I do not know if you ever thought of that.

But I would think from my experience and what I do that for most shame-based people it deeply affects their relationship with God.  So number one would be why would God love me?  I am done.  I am unlovable.  So I do not really believe though I believe it academically that He loves me.  I do not let myself feel that He loves me.  That's part one.  Part two, sadly for many churches that do not understand shame and the effect of shame they provide ways for people to wear masks and hopefully get love and respect from God.  So you can hide the real you just come and serve and keep these rules and do these things then God will love you.  They do not feel that God loved them if they did not do those things but only if they do those things.  So the question that I have thought about for years and I think needs a clear answer to shame-based people is it's important to get to the point where you see that God loves you as you are.  You do not have to perform or do anything.  So what I wanted to do in the Christian part in this shame series is give you Bible stories that illustrate that.  Okay?  So tonight I am going to tell you a story from the life of King David and we have told a number of stories from him, his life but it's going to be about a guy named Mephibosheth.  Now I do not know who would call their kid that but that was his name.  I even thought of how could I abbreviate that?  I call him Phib?  No, that does not work.  Meph?  No, that's too much like meth.  Bosh?  No, that does not work.  So we got Mephibosheth.  Okay.  So just to give you the context, David's been king for 20 years and so he's well established as king.  During that 20 years of his reign, the nation of Israel has grown eight or conquered eight nations and grown six times its normal size.  So it's expanded.  And it has just prospered.  And so he has become basically the richest king in the world and he's got all this territory, etc.  So it's a time of great popularity, a time of great wealth and prestige.  David is at the top of his game, at the pinnacle of his life.  So the question that people have would go like this.  When David became a king, the thing that they were told about David was he was a man with God's heart.  A man after God's own heart.  Has wealth changed him?  Has power changed him?  Has popularity changed him?  Because that's changed a lot of people and made them terrible people.  So it sticks in this story to show us that what David's heart was like, but it also shows us what God's heart was like.  So let me tell you about this Mephibosheth guy.  David, after 20 years, remembers his best friend was the previous king's son.  So the previous king was King Saul.  His son was Jonathan.  And David and Jonathan were close, close friends like brothers, we are told.  And David made a promise to Jonathan that he would take care of his descendants if Jonathan died.  So now after 20 years of being a king, he remembers that promise and he says, is there still anyone alive in Saul's family?  Because I promised Jonathan I would show them kindness.  And so somebody comes and says, Jonathan's son, Mephibosheth, is still alive.  Now you have to understand why that was the dumbest question that people thought David should have asked.  Because in that culture, the kings passed to their sons and their grandson so that you had a dynasty.  So who would have been the greatest threat to King David's power as the king of Israel?  A little guy named Mephibosheth.  He was the only one left from King Saul's family, so he was the greatest threat to David's power and David's kingdom.  So for David to say, is there still anybody alive that I can be good to?  People are going, David, no.  Because the common practice when a king took over a throne is he killed all the descendants of the previous king to make sure there were no threats to his kingdom.  And David is doing the exact opposite.  He's wanting to find members of the previous king's family in order to help them.  So now we are told about this Mephibosheth guy.  So Saul's son, Jonathan, had a son named Mephibosheth who was a cripple since he was a child.  When he was five years old, the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had died in a battle.  So that's how Saul's reign ended and David became king.  Twenty years earlier, Saul had been in a war Jonathan with him.  They died in battle.  When the news came out that Saul and Jonathan were dead, the nurse of that little boy, Mephibosheth, said, the new king's going to want to kill him.  I better hide him.  So she scooped him up and as she picked him up and fled and as she hurried away, she dropped him and he became a cripple.  He broke his legs.  So here is a boy who cannot walk.  And he has not been able to walk since he's been five years old.  So he's 25 now, 20 years of not walking.

The next thing we are told about him is that when the nurse scooped him up, she took him to a place called Lodabar.  And that is a town that was named No Pasture Land.  So what she is doing is saying, what is the location in Israel that nobody knows?  What is the location in Israel that nobody would ever want to go to?  Where there would be no chance of having a job, a farm, an income, because it's a desert, there's no pasture.  It is the last place anybody would look.  So it's the best place to hide because it's the most remote place in all of Israel.  Lodabar.  That's where you are going, Mephibosheth.  So he's been hiding in this far away, out in the desert, little village for 20 years.  So nothing has happened.

But what I want you to understand is that I think when it says Lodabar, No Pasture Land, it's also using it as a metaphor.  It is saying that as Mephibosheth, the favored son of Jonathan, who is destined to be the king of Israel, had to run and flee for his life and became a cripple, he's been a No Pasture Land soul.  He's been dead inside.  There's been nothing of life that's growing there.  His life has been dark and empty and barren.  Now I want you to think of that in terms of yourself.  Many of you can relate to being Mephibosheth as a five year old.  You had a good life.  You had parents who were wealthy.  You had a nice home.  You had every privilege that a kid could get.  You had it all going for you.  You had a bright future ahead of you.  Just like Mephibosheth had.  And he would have been chosen as the child in the nation of Israel who would have been the best at succeeding.  He would have had the brightest future of anybody else living in Israel.  That was his destiny as a five year old kid.  Twenty years later, no family, no money, no friends, a cripple, dead, isolated, lost everything, no future.  It all looks scary.  His life is lived in hiding and fear.  Sound like an addict?  Who's lost everything and you are living in Lodabar.  You know what, how Mephibosheth referred to himself when David finally brought him into the castle?  He says, refer to me as a dead dog.  And what that meant was, I am useless.  I am full of shame.  I feel I have zero value.  I feel my life is like a dead dog.  And that is what many of you relate to.  So here is what David's story is saying.  How does God feel about the Mephibosheth of the world?  How does God feel about the people who have lost everything and live in fear and brokenness and emptiness with no future prospects?  Does God love them or say they deserve it?  I am going to wipe them out.  And what this story is saying, David has God's heart.  So how David responds is how God feels about the Mephibosheth of the world.  So watch what happens.  David sent for him and brought him to the palace.  Now you can imagine when a messenger shows up out in Lodabar and you have been hiding successfully for 20 years and says, Oh, we finally found you.  King David wants to see you.  You are going, I hope my will's in good shape here because I am about to be killed.  You are filled with dread.  And when he came to David, he bowed low to the ground in deep respect.  Do not be afraid, David said.  I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan.  I will give you all the property, that once belonged to your grandfather, Saul.  That's a lot of property.  And you will eat here with me at the king's table.  In other words, Mephibosheth, I am giving you back what you once had.  You never have to worry about being cared for again.  You never have to worry about a meal again.  I will meet your needs now.  You are going to finally get taken care of the way you should have all along.  Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, Who is your servant that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?  Do you want to know what God's love feels like?  I do not deserve it.  And that's what Mephibosheth is feeling.  Why are you doing this?  It does not logically make sense.  I do not deserve this kind of love.  You should be wanting to kill me, not love me.  And so from that time on, Mephibosheth ate regularly at David's table like one of the king's own son.  He did not get the corner table while the king's sons had the nice table and he got the scraps.  No, he sat with everybody else.  He got the royal treatment.  So here's the word I want you to understand to understand God's heart.  When Moses went up into a mountain before the city of Bethlehem, before this time and received the Ten Commandments, he said to God, Please show me what you are like.  Show me your glory.  And God said, I am going to hide you in a rock and I am going to pass in front of you and let you see my glory, my greatness.  And then he went on to say, Let me describe to you myself.  And what he said is, Here is the core of my character.  Here's the essence that all of my character is built on.  And guess what it is?  It's not anger like some people would try to make you think God's core is.  It's a word that's called has said.  And it said is a word that our English language cannot fully capture.  It's a word that includes.  I am committed to you unconditionally forever.  Like a parent would say to a child.  It is a word that includes love, delight, forgiveness, grace, mercy, mercy, love, and grace.  So what's mercy?  I do not get what I deserve.  What's grace?  I get what I do not deserve.  Instead of getting the judgment I deserve, I get the blessings I do not deserve.  So what God is saying is, You want to get to the core of me?  I do not set up relationships based on you earn my love.  All my relationships are grace and mercy.  Has said.  I overflow in giving people what they do not deserve.  A kindness and forgiveness.  It talked about a depth of love only known by a parent or a couple that loves each other in a deep healthy way.  And that's what it is saying is God's love.  So how does God feel about the Mephibosheth of the world?  Is he saying you got to earn my love?  Is it saying you better hide your shame and start keeping these rules?  He says I see your shame.  I see what you deserve.  I see all of that about you.

But I want you to know something.  You are living in Lodabar.  You are empty.  All of those things.  I am going to find you and I am going to love you.  And I want to bless you.  And I want to fill up your life again.  And I want to give you gifts that you could never earn.  And I am giving them to you all because of grace.  And that is the message that comes out of Mephibosheth.
