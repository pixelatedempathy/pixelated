Okay.  So those are just some of the lies that come out of shame.  And what I want you to understand is you may have been operating by those lies without even realizing it.  And so the whole point of what this exercise tonight has been is you cannot change something until you become aware of it.

But with shame, most of it operates at a subconscious level.  So I cannot deal with shame until I grow in self-awareness about how shame has affected me and how it works out in all kinds of subtle ways.  So I am not doing this to discourage you, to make you feel overwhelmed with how screwed up you are, though you might be feeling that.  I am doing this so you become aware of all the subtle intricacies of shame in your life.  Because only as you are aware can you begin to change those lies and replace them with the truth.  Now this is one part of healing from shame.  There is an intellectual part to healing from shame.  So the first thing that I want people to get is there is an intellectual component, there is a relationship component, there is a physical component, there is a spiritual component, emotional component.  Everything affects shame, but intellectual is one part.

But it's not the only part.  So a lot of people go around and say, I just need to tell myself the truth.  And I say, good.

But if that's the only thing you do, it probably will not be enough.  After a while, you will stop doing it because you will not believe those truths anymore because you are not doing the rest.  Okay?  Now let me explain how this works out.  I get clients to think of what are truths that you could tell yourself every day as positive affirmations.  You can stick them on the fridge and every morning you can look at them and say to yourself, I have value.  I am lovable.  And do that.  And you need to come up with some lie or some truths to begin to replace the lies.

But you have to understand a very important thing about your brain.  Shame and complex trauma are all about the limbic brain.  And the limbic brain is the emotional part of your brain.  The limbic brain is also the child brain.  So the child gets up in the morning and they say, I do not feel like going to school so I should not have to go to school.  So how they feel determines what they think is real.  Okay?  So what happens with shame-based people is I do not feel I am good enough so I will treat myself as if I am not good enough.  I treat myself based on how I feel about myself.  That is limbic brain thinking.  That is complex trauma thinking.  And complex trauma has made the limbic brain the most powerful part of your brain.  Healing from shame begins by letting your cortex trump your limbic brain.  So here's how it works.  I wake up.  I say I need some time alone just to connect with myself, with my higher power.  I am going to do some meditation, some prayer, go for a walk.  And I start to feel guilty.  I am being selfish.  And so what does that shame part of your brain say?  I am going to get down on myself.  I am going to say you are a selfish person.  Why would anybody want to love you?  You are just a terrible person.  And you start beating yourself up because your limbic brain says you should.  Treat yourself based on how you are feeling about yourself.

But the cortex needs to step in and say no.  I know that I have value.  I know I need to take care of myself if I am going to be any good to other people.  And so I am going to treat myself with respect.  I am not going to feed the guilt.  I am not going to start beating myself up.  I am going to choose to treat myself with respect.  That's letting the cortex determine how you act.  And as you treat yourself with respect, over time what will happen is you will start to feel better about yourself.  So your cortex will begin to change your limbic to a more positive feeling about self.  So my problem with a lot of programs that try to help people with low self-esteem, and shame, is they say look in the mirror and tell yourself you love you, yourself, and give yourself a pedicure and a manicure and then feel your way to a better you.  And I go you cannot feel your way to a better you when your limbic brain is screwed up.  You got to start with your cortex.  And you got to treat yourself based on the facts that you know to be true.  And you got to treat yourself based on the facts that you know to be true, not based on the feelings that shame has produced towards yourself.  And so you are acting your way to a better feeling.  You are saying the truth is not what I feel, that's not my reality, though it has been in my past, but that's got me in all kinds of trouble.  The truth is I do have value.  I do have positive qualities.  I am a lovable person.  And you begin to treat yourself based on those facts.  So that is easier said than done.  Because what we are going to look at next week is that in any given day, your shame can get triggered hundreds of times.  And what happens when your shame gets triggered?  Your limbic brain gets triggered.  And you start feeling negatively and have negative feelings about yourself and everything in you wants to go to beating myself up and being critical.  And so you are catching yourself constantly saying, shut up limbic brain, cortex take over, I am going to follow you.  And you have this argument in your head between the two parts of your brain and as you learn to follow the truth of your cortex, your limbic gradually begins to change.  So that's step one in starting to turn this whole shame thing around.  So I do not know if I have discouraged you tonight or given you a little bit of hope.  I hope it has given you some hope but also greater self-awareness.  Next week we will start getting into the tools to heal those hearts.  So for the Christian part tonight, I thought what I would do is talk about what are some of the tools that God has given us to heal our hearts.  What are some of the truths that God says about who we are?  So let's get the most accurate mirror in the world, God, let's take a look at that and see what He says about who we are.  And let that become the beginning, the framework of how we rebuild an accurate self-identity.  And that is, I think, the most important thing.  Because if I was to say you are a great person, you go, who are you?  You do not know me.

But if God knows everything about me and every secret I have and even stuff I do not even know about myself, what does He still say about me?  So there is somebody I can rely on what they say as being accurate and truthful.  And God does actually say quite a bit about us.  And so I want to develop it and show it to you.  And hopefully you can begin to either memorize it, but make that part of your identity and your understanding.  So Romans 8 says this.  You have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves.  Instead, you received God's spirit when he adopted you as his own children.  Now we call him Abba.  And that word Abba is just an Aramaic word from that time, which was how a child said daddy.  So it was the most intimate child expression, papa, daddy.  For his spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God's children.  And since we are his children, we are his heirs.  What's significant about that is that God does not just bring us into a relationship where we sit in the waiting room and wait for the appointment once in a while.  No.  If you got the president of the United States, well, we will not talk about him, but the prime minister of Canada, and you might have all these people waiting in line to talk to him, but if his kid wants to talk to him, he's got first access.  There's a relationship that brings with it intimacy or the potential for intimacy.  There's a relationship where God makes himself available, not as a distant father or an angry father, but an available, loving father.  And he wants that kind of relationship.  He desires for us to feel safe enough with him and close enough to him that we can call him daddy or an intimate, trusting expression.  And he's so okay with us, he says, I am going to make you the heirs of everything I have.  So you do not just do that for some jerk.  You do that for somebody.  You are invested in and have faith in.  So that's the starting point.  Romans 15 says, Accept each other just as Christ has accepted you.  So what is he saying?  Accept each other unconditionally.  Warts and all.  Failures.  That's how Christ accepted us.  What is that saying?  He is the only person who has totally unconditionally accepted us, for who we are, body, soul, personality, emotional makeup, intellectual makeup.  He designed us.  He accepts us.  We do not have to fear rejection or criticism from him about ourselves.  That kind of acceptance does not exist in very many places, but it does exist with God.  Third one.  You are a chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are chosen people.  You are royal priests, a holy nation, God's very own special possession.  You might have had parents who had different trinkets and toys, but you knew that certain things were special possessions and you did not mess with those things.  Or you knew that other kids come to your house and play and mom and dad would give them attention, but when they looked, they looked at you, there was a twinkle in their eye that was not there for other kids.  There was an excitement and a pride that you were their kid.  And that's what he is saying is you are not God's trinket that he puts on the back of a shelf to collect dust because it has no value.  You are a treasured, special possession that gets very special treatment.  A very important truth.  Next one.  See how very much our Father loves us.  Now just in the Greek language that the New Testament was written in, that saying there is this.  The love that God has for us is not like human love.  It's like it's from another planet.  It's aliens.  It is so great.  It is so beyond our conditional limited kind of love.  We call it an alien type of love.  Do you realize that?  Yes.  Do you realize that as a parent, I had three children, I could not give my attention 24-7 to each child because I have limitations.  Do you realize God can give 24-7 attention to every one of his kids?  He's never busy because he is capable of that.  That's how great he is.  So what he is saying is God's love goes to another level that is beyond even our human love and it is available to all 24-7.  It is an acceptance of all.  There is an unconditional forgiveness.  All of those different pieces come with God's love that you go, this is love from another planet that he would even call us his children.  Dear friends, we are already God's children, but he has not shown us yet what we will be like when Christ appears.

But we do know this, that we will be like Jesus for we will see him as he really is.  So what God is saying is, you are a work in progress.  You are not yet the finished product.

But he loves you so much that he is committed to one day finish what he started in you and when he finishes what he started, you are going to be beautiful just like Jesus.  There is not even going to be one flaw in you anymore.  That's how committed he is.  That's how deep his love goes.  That's how long his love lasts.  That's how deep his commitment towards you goes.  Matthew 12, this is a verse that Finding Freedom was based on.  You may have heard me talk about it.

But it's based on describing the life and ministry of Jesus.  It was in response to the religious leaders at that time who basically said, we give our attention to the good living people, the wealthy people, the people with status, the addicts, the prostitutes, we ignore them, they are scum.  And they thought God felt that way and so that's how they said, that's why we treat people that way.  So Jesus comes along and he says, no, that's not what God is like.  And he tells this, he says, look at my servant, Jesus, whom I have chosen.  He's my beloved who pleases me.  I will put my spirit upon him.  He will proclaim justice to the nations.  He will not fight or shout or cry.  He will not speak or raise his voice in public.  In other words, Jesus was not going to go on great political campaigns, start wars.  He was going to do stuff in a very quiet, person to person way.  And here's what he says he's going to do.  He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle.  In that culture that was full of meaning.  The weakest reed or bruised reed was an illustration from shepherding.  So if you imagine yourself as a teenager and your dad says, you got to take care of the sheep.  Well, sheep are boring.  They eat and sleep, eat, sleep, and they stand there and look at each other.  What are you supposed to do all day taking care of the sheep?  So what a shepherd boy would do was he would make himself a little flute and he would use a reed that was growing in the ditch.  And it's much like Manitoba.  There's reeds everywhere.  There are so many reeds you cannot even sell them.  They are that plentiful.  They have that little value.  So a boy would carve out a little flute from a reed and he would start to play the flute to kind of put in the hours of the day.

But because of saliva, the reed would start to break down and pretty soon the flute would not work.  So you would think, what are you going to do, shepherd boy, with that bruised reed?  It's no longer any good.  It's used up.  It's damaged.  The shepherd boy would go, I will throw it away.  There's a million other reeds right here.  I can cut myself another one.  And so the thing is, what does God do with people who were once able to perform, play music with their life but it become damaged and there's no more music coming out of their soul?  Does he say, you are so damaged you are useless?  I got lots of 7 billion people.  I will just pick another one and use them.  No, it says God takes the broken, the bruised, the ones that no longer produce music, and he does not destroy them but he makes them have music again.  That's how he treats the weakest reed.  And that is what Jesus is saying, is I do not take those outcasts and broken people and say, get out of here, you are useless.  I rebuild them so that they can perform music with their lives again.  The other illustration is a similar one.  They did not have so much what we would have.  They did not have electricity, did not have many candles.  So you would have lamps that had oil in them.  And what you would use for a wick was a piece of flax straw.  And like again, Manitoba, flax straw is plentiful everywhere.  You cannot even sell it.  There's so much.  So you would make a wick and what would you do when the wick started burning down and sputtering?  You would throw it out and get another piece.  And so the point was this, what does God do with lives that no longer produce light?  That are sputtering.  The light is dying.  The light has gone out.  Does he throw it out and say, you are useless?  No, he trims that wick.  He makes it so it has light again.  So what I want you to understand is God takes people who have tons of shame, people who themselves believe they are useless and no longer able to produce anything of value and he says, I do not believe that lie.

Let me show you.  I will take your life and I will remake it to be fruitful and productive again.  That's the truth God wants us to get.  Next one.  I love this one.  Deuteronomy 32, it says this, He found them, that's Israel, but you can put your name in there, in a desert land, empty land, howling wasteland, nothing's growing, no fruit, no vegetables.  It is desert.  It is dead.  He surrounded this person that he found in this barren desert place that if they were not rescued quickly they would die.  And he found them and he surrounded them and he watched over them and then he says, he guarded them as he would guard them and he said, guard his own eyes.  Do you realize that your eye is the organ that is visible?  All your other organs are hidden and protected behind ribs and stuff like that.  Your eyes are exposed, but you have five different things that are built to protect your eyes.  You have eyebrows, you have eyelashes, you have eyelids, you have tears that flow and you have instant reflexes if somebody comes near your eye.  And what is he saying?  Your eye is the most protected part of your exposed body.  There is all kinds of attention given to making sure it is kept safe.  In other words, your eye is treated as very, very valuable.  And if you lose your sight, you begin to realize how much you value your sight.  So what is God saying?  I treat you like the eye.  That's how special you are to me.  That's how much I am preoccupied with you.  And then the next verse says, like an eagle that rouses her chicks and hovers over her young, so God spreads his wings to take them up and carried them safely on his pinions.  I have told you this story before.  I love it.  And it's all about eagles.  Eagles, if you ever notice, their nests are always very, very high.  And that's because eagles do not have any instinct naturally to fly.  So a baby eagle does not have an instinct to flap his wings and begin to fly.  How do they learn to fly?  Mom pushes them out of the nest.  And they go, I have the meanest mom in the world as they are tumbling to the ground.  Guess what God does to help us grow?  He says, I think you are ready to fly.  Push.  God, you are mean.  I hate you.  And so the first time, what an eagle does with their great big wings, and this is what this verse is saying, the mother sees their baby tumbling along, falling, and it swoops down and spreads itself under the baby eagle and it lands on the mother's wings.  And it swoops it back up to the nest.  What it is saying is, it might look at times that God puts you in danger and does not care.  Do not believe that.  That's a lie.  He's like that mother eagle.  And he will swoop down and he will be there for you.

But you got to understand what happens next.  You get back up to the nest.  He goes, okay.  Out you go again.  And then the next time down, the eagle puts his wings out and all of a sudden the wind catches them and they go, whoo, this.  And they get the idea of flying.  And pretty soon they go, I have the smartest mom in the world.  I am so glad she pushed me out of that nest.  And that's what God does.  Next one.  The eternal God is your refuge and his everlasting arms are under you.  In other words, it's the picture of a child that is tired.  A child that is afraid.  And what does a father do?  What does a loving father do?  He goes under them with his arms and he carries them.  He takes the load that they cannot handle.  Gives the strength that they cannot provide and provides the resources by carrying them.  Do you ever stop and think about where do you naturally carry a child next to your heart?  And what do little children learn?  They can learn to hear your heartbeat.  And so when God talks about carrying us, he's carrying us close to his heart.  He goes on and says this, let the beloved of the Lord rest secure in him.  He shields him all day long and the one the Lord loves rests between his shoulders.  Now you can take that two ways.  Number one, your head goes right here between his shoulders.  He carries you next to his heart or he carries you at times on his shoulders when you are too weak to walk.  When I was going through my darkest valley, somebody gave me that verse.  And that verse became my favorite verse for a long time.  That God was carrying me and letting me rest between his shoulders.  The verse that helped me the most before that was the next one, Isaiah 41.  Do not be afraid for I am with you.  Do not be discouraged for I am your God.  I will strengthen you.  I will help you.  I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.  Times when you are too weak to carry yourself, I do not, God says, judge you and say you are useless.  I strengthen you by helping you with my righteous right hand.  So those are some of the truths of the Bible.  Oh, do not want to go there.  Those are some of the truths of the Bible on what God says to you about you and about how he feels about you.  And I hope you can internalize that and make it your own and believe it, not just academically, but let it start to penetrate down deep inside.
