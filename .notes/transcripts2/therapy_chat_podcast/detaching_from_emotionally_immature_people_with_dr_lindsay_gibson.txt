Hi, welcome back to Therapy Chat. I'm your host, Laura Regan, and today I'm happy to be joined once again by Dr. Lindsay Gibson. Lindsay, thank you much for coming back to Therapy Chat today. Oh, it's a pleasure to be back. Thank you, Laura. , I'm happy to be talking about your newest book, Disentangling from Emotionally Immature People. I'll just hold it up for the camera and why it's difficult to disentangle from emotionally immature people. before we get into it, though, will you just tell our audience a little bit more about who you are and what you do? Sure. I'm a psychologist and I've been a psychotherapist for over 30 years now. I also do coaching. . And I have, I think it's five books now. Probably, I just can't seem to stop doing it. Probably the best known is Adult Children of Emotionally Immature Parents. And that turned into a series. And then this most recent book, The Disentangling from Emotionally Immature People, kind of broadens that out. We go from talking about the parents to everybody who is emotionally immature in your life. . we talk about people in general that have emotional immaturity. And it's a topic that I just can't get enough of because it's endlessly fascinating to me how different these people are from people who are just adequately emotionally mature. , I don't think that there's not a continuum in this setting. . In the sense that, , all the way at the bottom, they're the emotionally immature people, and then all the way at the top, they're the emotionally mature. , we're on a continuum, ? And emotionally immature people, when we get sick or tired or stressed, we become less emotionally mature in our functioning. we can, , that marker can move. But there are a few characteristics of emotional immaturity that are really important. And, and, and that's, that's a big part of our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our, our focused on I'mnsaturokraty. That are really kind of hallmarks that if a person has those characteristics, we might consider them to be, , sort of, , , an emotionally immature personality. Because if you have adequate maturity, you're not going to have these problems. You're not going to have these characteristics we, we, we can talk about that more, , about what those characteristics are, but, just find it fascinating that these people often cause much pain and much frustration in the people that they're in relationship with. And I've just sort of, , made it my life study to help people understand what's going on with that, because you can really feel bad about yourself and even wonder if you're crazy or if you're inadequate because of the difficulties there are in relationships with emotionally immature people. And what I found is that when people get a little bit of information about where they're coming from and how they're functioning and why, it's just empowering. I mean, they get back a sense of, , , that's what's going on. Now I understand why they're this way. And it gives them some observational distance and it allows them to really see the situation much more objectively. . , thank you. And it is confusing when, and , I don't know, I guess we do fluctuate in how mature we may be feeling in given stages and points in our lives, but , I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. , can you help us sort of, can you paint a picture of what the characteristics are of someone who kind of tends toward that being emotionally immature? , people can, , if for anybody who's not familiar with your work, just have a sense of what we're really talking about. . , sure. , I just want to mention that it's absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely, absolutely possible for a person who in their emotional development has stayed kind of, , immature. They haven't continued to grow up, , emotionally. It's perfectly possible that in other areas of their development, they did grow up. They, they successfully achieved a certain amount of, , development and maturity in those areas, their intellectual development. I mean, you could be a college professor, you could be, , running a successful business, you could be very intelligent, you could be a physicist. . That has nothing to do with your emotional maturity. And similarly, a person can have really good social development. , they can be the most popular person in the group. They can be thought of. They can be a leader in the community, but when they get home and they're in the, , kind of the, the intimate, , , realm of personal relationship, and they get stressed or, , somebody, , doesn't want to do what they say, then you're going to see this immaturity start coming out in the privacy of the home or when they think no one's looking. . , . anyway, , but I just wanted to say that people understood that they're, they are confusing people because they can be -functioning in other areas. And they can have their good days and their, , more emotionally available days too. people get very confused with thinking, , , they're not this, , every second of every day, sometimes, , it feels pretty good with them. But let's talk about some of the characteristics that really make it tough, , to have a relationship in which you can be yourself with them. . And you can feel you're not going to be the same person that you were when you were a kid. And you can feel you're not going to be the same person that you were when you were a kid. And you can feel they are actually seeing you and attending to you as a real person because emotionally immature people have a big problem with even recognizing the subjective experience of other people. , I mean, they see you, they interact with you, but they don't have the kind of imaginative experience of, of what it must be on the inside of you. In other words, their empathy is usually pretty poor. , and that's again, a lack of this imaginative capacity that we have. If you're adequately emotionally mature, we can sort of, , put ourselves in the shoes of the other person. We can imagine how something's going to affect them. And, and that is something that comes very naturally, very automatically when you have matured to a certain level in your emotional development. But for emotionally immature people, they, they just don't get it that there's an inside world. , they don't understand that they're not attuned to it. , they tend to, we had talked about this earlier, but , they tend to get very concrete, , , dealing with it. , and they tend to get very concrete, , , dealing with what they would consider the facts, , dealing with the physical, the material, the tangible and, , stuff that goes on inside you, the emotional, , even, even the spiritual, even the, , , the, the sense of, , art and, , , kind of uplift feeling, , these, these other wonderful inside world feelings, they don't get that. That's not interesting to them. They think it's a good thing. They think it's a waste of time because there's no utilitarian value in it. And there's no utilitarian value in any of us having, , an inner world. But if you want to have relationships, if you want to have meaningful work, if you want to be fulfilled in your life, you have to have that inner world. the emotionally immature person kind of comes at life in a very egocentric way. Very self-centered. They know they're real, but , other people and things that go on outside of them just aren't that interesting to them. All roads lead back to them. And if you've ever tried to have a conversation with them, you'll find that even if they appear to be interested in you at first, it won't be long before they have found a way to bring the topic back to the thing that they want to talk about or something about it. , I mean, , people who are on a Mohla- are moving towards audience being able tooded at themselves. It's a very reliable indicator of emotional immaturity. They also have very poor self reflection. They just don't think about their behavior. whew And I said, they don't have the imagination and the empathy to have a sense of how they're impacting other people. They just don't get it. It's about√¢ . you have some kind of self-reflection. And Laura, by self-reflection, I don't mean that they know, for instance, they say something , oh, I'm bossy, or I'm the oldest child, I'm bossy. They might know some things about themselves. That's not the same thing as self-reflection. Self-reflection, because they'll say, , I know I'm bossy, I'm a brat. Are they thinking about really what that means? Are they intending to change that? Absolutely not. They just know it about themselves. But without that self-reflection, we can't change ourselves. We're not interested in changing ourselves. And if you can't do that, you can't apologize. You can't make reflections. You can't make reflections. Repairs in relationships, it's a real death knell to intimacy in a relationship, which makes a lot of sense for an emotionally immature person because they are really scared of emotional intimacy. They don't dig it at all. They to keep things on the level of events, actions, facts. Plans. They don't want to go into, let's talk about how each of us is feeling. Let's share our thoughts. Let's get to know each other at a deeper level. Their view would be, what for? , why are you doing all this touchy-feely stuff? , we're doing it because if you do have the capacity for emotional intimacy, you do want to be in a relationship. You do want to be in a relationship. You do want to be in a relationship. You do want to be known. And you want to know other people. And you want to see and be seen. , you have that wonderful feeling of connection. , , we got to know each other a little bit better. But the emotionally immature person is not into that at all. They tend to see it as what I feel is what is real. I don't really need to do a lot of investigation. I don't need to do a lot of investigation. I don't need to do a lot of communication or listening to you, because I pretty much know what I know about you. And I'd be happy to tell you. And we don't have to waste time with all this communication stuff, because I know I'm . That's the emotionally immature position. And it makes it extremely frustrating and demoralizing when you're trying to have a deeper relationship with a person that. And then finally, the emotionally immature person has a really sort of idiosyncratic approach to reality. Anything they don't , anything that makes them nervous, they will tend to deny it, dismiss it, or distort it. They interpret reality on the basis of how it makes them feel. if you tell your parent, for instance, Jacques √¢ √Ç √Ç you just say.√Ç √Ç , I just must be the worst mother ever.√Ç √Ç you just I can't do anything . Why are you mad at me all the time.√Ç because the mother felt stung that she was being, quote, reprimanded. And on the basis of her feelings, with this extreme reaction. But what's really going on is that she has interpreted reality on the basis of her vulnerability to rejection or shame or whatever it is. And she's come back in that very emotionally reactive way. And meanwhile, you just didn't want the corn cob to go to eat. , you're , don't break my sink because we need to be able to run water through this thing. Exactly. , but it's often, , that's what gives rise to that feeling , , you're walking on eggshells or, , you have to be very careful with them because they get reactive. . And it's . In my experience in. relating with someone who is how you describe is. there's not. there's not a sense of openness about different perspectives or. anything that's being said that's being curious about a different way of looking at it or just even. expanding on an idea is seen as kind of an annoying extra talking that doesn't need to be happening. I love that. That is it. Annoying extra talking that doesn't need to be happening. That's it. Exactly. then you become the annoying mosquito that they're swatting away. And all you're trying to do is . actually have a conversation that isn't just them making an announcement or pronouncement about something and you. it's I'm just trying to be here. To as part of this relationship. It feels . Exactly. Let me in. Exactly. , that's really put. I'm just trying to be here too. And from the other person's point of view from the emotionally immature person's point of view. It's kind of , why are you trying to be here too? I'll tell you what you need to know. I'll. I'll lead us. I'll inform you. I'll tell you what to do next. It's why are you trying to. insinuate yourself into this relationship? And of course, we know that we're trying. we're not trying to, , wiggle our way into something. We're trying to share or talk or, , have some kind of relation-based communication and connection. But from their point of view, , I mean does it feels a waste of time because they already know what they know. And they already know how you should be. And they. they're happy to tell you that. But they. , I mean curious or opening up about, , new things about each other or trying to have a discussion. That holds no appeal to them at all. In fact, it's frightening. , because they feel or they need to feel they know everything already. And their worldview is extremely rigid. , if you think of . , a circle is 360 degrees, , their little arc of perception is three degrees. And inside that they know everything there is to know about everything. And when you try to come in and say, , oh, there's this whole other circle. There's this whole other area. I would for you to get to know me better. Why, they would think. Why are we doing this? -. We already know. I already know who you are. You're my son. You're my daughter. . . And then when you're talking about when it's a parent that's this and the child is constantly challenging the way they expect things to be, the way the parent expects things to be, the child is doing things that the parent wouldn't have done, didn't. didn't imagine could happen, . It's this, whoa, why are you doing this to me? , but, , I can see how when the child is saying , I just, I'm. they call bids for connection, ? It's just a way to get, , just for you to feel that I'm also here and not just you being in your head. . . . That, that need is often the basis of a lot of people. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . It, it can be, it can sometime call that anxiety or that, oh my God, that rush surprised an empty physically. It can be a sort of pretty strong, and it can be a little bit tempting because you start something can be a little spooky, but another time when you're, , she lunch breaks looks in- Lori is going up asking you for Shalva one of my . Always been. Always been, she was saying , this is my? . . . Exactly. It makes me feel if I if I never used to, if I looked on top of this thing, and seeing how people have really lost their stir, capacity if you're interested and you have empathy and you want to relate to another person at a deeper level and be known at that deeper level it's it's very disappointing very demoralizing to have someone come back with that attitude of not having really any curiosity about anything in depth and they jump to a conclusion really fast and it's very hard to communicate with people that part about jumping to a conclusion too with parenting it's you are just a demanding child or you're you're the way that there can be a very simplistic oh i know that i'm not sure if i'm going to be able to answer that question but i think it's i'm this way i want deep connection with people and i have family members who let's say not to call anyone out on the podcast but let's say one of my caregivers is really a lot you're describing just this sort of lack of their caring but they have a lack of really understanding about anyone else's inner world they'll say things do you think that people just get depressed i don't know i don't think people are depressed they're just depressed and they can't not feel that way and it's yes i mean of course it can change but i do believe that's real that people can feel that way and then they'll say i don't know i guess i just have had a really good life i just don't understand that and then i know objectively that their life really wasn't all that good growing up it's it's more a fixable function for us to process and i know that would be for best and worst of both fighters question number two what are the goes until you're sadly clouds can make yourself unhappy because they bring up light and oh i'm anxious or you want to know and see what happens and all the arts are going off and on go after yourself and the somewhat fluid way of doing things or the old the old way of thinking about things and that's good but i think one of the great things that you learn is that you it's your mind has to be open let's blood do the most useful when we say the most useful thing and more i'm telling this is the flow hinears upon each other that's an interesting thinking thing i think but i don't think if i have to√£√•√©∆í excited because then all the people who have a lot of superficial i just don't think about it i move on i there is no reflective depth there's no there's no shadowing there's no perspective it's it's just things are very much on the surface and of course if you see the world that way it's really easy to make snap decisions and to see things in black and white and wrong good and bad which is a nightmare when you're a child and your parent is sizing you up that these very extreme categories based on whether or not they what you're doing that's that's hard on the self-esteem it was and if you if you see the way i look at it is in order to be a whole person we really are equipped and made to use both our and left hemispheres of our brain we need some problem solving we need some categorizing abstract sequential thought we need to be analytical that's all great but we need our depth man we really need to be able to have intuition have imagination feel our way into situations have an instinct about something have a that's just deeper than what my social role is ideally i mean i mean they've done much research on brain functioning and what happens when people have injuries to one side or the other the brain and it's kind of been proven that if you're not using a part of your brain enough you're really missing out on the full the full experience of being a human being who can be in relationship with other people i mean it's a big to me it's a big deal it isn't just that these people are kind of difficult or they're a little bit frustrating it's a whole thing about how their mind and how their brain works or doesn't work and that's probably related to some kind of trauma having to do with attachment or security and that all has to come from the hemisphere of the brain i mean babies and mothers relate to each other through hemisphere resonance or kind of that attunement but if you have problems with that early in life and maybe that mother isn't or that mothering person i should say maybe that person isn't sensitive and maybe they aren't attuned over time that child might learn oh the side of my brain is not a safe place for me to hang out because i go into all these feelings and i get these intuitions and i and people look at me i have two heads maybe it just would be better if i became them and stayed over here in the left hemisphere more be very logical be very categorized black and white that i mean i think that's that's a that's a very important thing to be able to do and it's not a big deal to be able to do that because it's not a big deal to be able to do that but it's a big deal to be able to do that it to me it's it's a very big deal because it means when you're emotionally immature that you're not using the full complement of what your brain is designed to do which is to use both sides and both types of abilities yes i i really see what you mean and i and i'll say for myself with my parents and i was a very emotional person and i was very emotional and sensitive i had a lot of stress and i was very emotional and sensitive and i was very emotional and sensitive for me there was i think i was very emotional and sensitive and then became very kind of locked down and disconnected from my emotions as a way to cope and then it was a very difficult process to come back to feeling my emotions but when because i even noticed how in my marriage i would be when taking care of little kids and working and all the things can just become very transactional it's oh who's picking up this and what's for dinner and how are we do we need to go the grocery store and just sort of passing but without that i'm not a very emotional person i'm not a very emotional person and i don't have a lot of time but it's special to what we do and why we do it at home and that's what makes really helping that make that veryapa important we're with an angela and we're with a lot ofTravis. Sandra jangan we love you that means much to us and to the parents of these amazing young babies and we just want to thank you for talking with us and it was such a pleasure not just a pleasure as usual thanks joe much about being here i'm really√ë√ë√ë√ë an honor being here that was lovely it is our pleasure that you helped us to join this Nicola Howell family i want to acknowledge Nurian and the whole team of the mom and rice family on the a donkey for helping us learn about Adv√≠√Ø¬Ω and myself and i'll stop at the end of the presentation tapestry that's just woven together in a beautiful way even though there's a lot of pain but there's also joy and happiness and sadness and fear and anger and all the feelings it just feels much more alive to be that way it is i mean it is much more alive because you're using everything in yourself which was designed to be used it was designed to be experienced not only because it's nice and not only because these feelings are wonderful and meaningful there's that's a big word with this i think that the meaning comes from all these values and abilities of the hemisphere we it feels meaningful to us and if you don't have that then you begin to lose your sense of basic meaning in life and then that leads into a particular kind of depression that is i mean it's very hard to come back from that if you get too far away from those more internal gifts that we all have i appreciate the way you described the characteristics of someone who is emotionally immature and i hear and we've talked about not only today but in our previous interview too how it can change it's not a fixed state of being someone who is emotionally immature can change that can change for them if they have self-reflection when people ask me can they change or will they change yes if they are capable of self-reflecting or something happens in their life that sort of makes them self-reflect because it's they can't get out of that box that they're in they're not just going to say i want to become curious about myself it has to be something it might it might be external it might come in with the spouse saying they're leaving or they might end up on the wrong side of the law or whatever and some judge says you need to be in treatment i mean there are ways that they get to being self-reflective but i just wanted to mention that because that's such an important criterion for whether or not a person will change yes they have to see that there's something missing to want to make a change exactly otherwise why would you especially if you already think everything's you're doing is and it's the other people that are the problem exactly in relationship and i won't go into this part too much because i feel it's interesting how even though i have a parent who's that and my other parent is different i'm i didn't i had an interruption in my emotional development and then was able to work with it because something didn't feel satisfying to me i guess there was enough of the budding self-awareness that was coming to the surface for me to catch that but it's it's hard when you have that upbringing and then your siblings might be the same way as the parent was or that's just not the case for me i think it's it's hard to be that and then that's a way that they've all adapted to the way the parent was it can make it really hard to have close sibling relationships close friendships and i guess you don't have to choose to be friends with people who aren't interested in deep connection but your siblings are they're already there they're you didn't really get to choose them it can be really hard to be in relationship with people who are functioning in that way and don't see anything wrong with it and it's you mentioned early in our discussion today it can feel we can gaslight ourselves what am i doing wrong with this person i'm trying to let them know what i need in this relationship or how what's not working for me and they're just why are you talking to me that's where i feel your book here is beneficial this particular newest book and how to disentangle from people who are emotionally immature because it's you try to figure out how to set a boundary or what to say and the person just kind of doesn't it doesn't seem to register they either ignore it what i said to you before we started recording was they just kind of override what you said disregard it and then for me when that has happened i'm what's what am i getting wrong here what why can't i understand boundaries why can't i set boundaries it's really that it makes it kind of brings that child part back for me where i'm oh i'm lost i have no idea what to do now i tried something it's not getting me anywhere can you talk a little bit about that this this is a topic that's really near and dear to my heart because i think that again if you're just looking at it from a standpoint of sort of cognitive or cognitive behavioral approaches to situations this it would be set the boundary tell them it's taken care of but that's a sound that's what they say set a boundary set that boundary and then my problem will be solved the problem is that the other person doesn't hear it or they don't respond to it and you set the boundary and they go on you haven't said anything or they say oh don't be ridiculous or they dismiss they dismiss it in some way i didn't do that he didn't do that he didn't mean that i didn't mean that they dismiss it and they distort what happened because they're really not interested in learning about how it felt to you or why you would want to set this boundary that is not interesting to them they don't get it when people are given that message that you just need to set the boundary i think they also need to be given the message that you may end up feeling very frustrated you can't make yourself heard you can't make yourself understood sprinkle√ê¬Ω√ê¬æ to their own Flame peace and means no i could recognize the loneliness moment when we talk about setting boundaries, you can get people ready for that by doing imagined encounters where they, , talk to an imaginary person or it could be their boss, it could be a parent, but they get some practice in actually saying things to them that are setting boundaries. Or you can role play with them as a therapist. But you're trying to get them sort of ready to speak up to, , take a more active position, which is hard with emotionally immature people, because they shut other people down really fast. I mean, some of them are very assertive in the way that they shut people down. Other people shut them down by dismissing them, or acting they're being silly, or, , just disregarding it. But I always, let people know that their job is to just try to set the boundary. It's not their job to guarantee that the other person hears it or respects it. That's another task. . But being able to say it is moving yourself out of this kind of enforced passive position that emotionally immature people often put their family members into. , you're supposed to be passive and go along with whatever I think is . But when you start to set boundaries, you are really moving into a much more assertive and active relationship vis-a-vis them. You just can't depend on them to hear you or want to understand. That is not within your control. And when people come back in a session with a kind of a hang dog look and say, , , I tried, I tried, but, , they just blew me off. It's , , of course they did. That's what they do. And of course you're feeling bad about yourself, but let's look at what happened. And I tell people a lot that, , if a person wants to understand what you're saying, it really doesn't matter how you say it. ? -huh. If a person, , doesn't want to understand what you're saying, it also doesn't matter how you say it. ? The reception of your message depends on the other person's worldview and the other person's receptivity. And that you don't have control over. boundary setting probably needs to be repeated, , with as little reactivity as possible. And then you can't control it. And you can't control it. You can't control it. You can't control it. You can't control it. You can't control it. It's lost. It's sort of over and over and over again, and it pops up over here and it pops up over there and you would keep the boundary and you repeat the boundary. And your goal is to try to not be reactive because it's frustrating when you've told somebody something or you've explained, , we, we always think that an explanation is going to solve the problem. Not if the other person's not listening, , not if they're not wanting to step inside your shoes it doesn't work that way is it is it possible i mean is it possible to have boundaries with people who are this and i guess what do you what do people end up doing is it is it you just have to break things off some people do that although i'm never the one to encourage anybody to move into estrangement because i think there's much good practice that can happen as long as you're having some contact with the people and i see here that there's a lot of good growth that can happen when you're in therapy and you still are in touch with your family or your family and you're still in touch with your family or your family and you're still in touch with your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your family or your person i'm i think people sometimes get the mistaken idea that i'm all for estrangement i'm not i am if the person's being abused or if there's something about that person that they just can't handle yes there are conditions but my client's the one who's going to decide that not me i'm not pushing one way or the other when you're gonna when you're going to make a boundary or set a boundary i encourage them to think about it in terms of you're not doing something against that person you are only trying to get space for yourself always look at it in terms of space it's not that you're shutting them out or not letting them do something it's you're just trying to get space for living space for yourself and you have to make it very remember how concrete and and specific they are you have to make it something that's pretty simple that doesn't have a lot of explanation i mean you can try to explain it once or twice or 10 times but if they are not interested i said and they're not listening that needs to be a part of the conversation and the conversation needs to be a part of the conversation to be abandoned and it needs to be short and sweet and repeated ad infinitum that this is what i can tolerate or this is what you can do in our house or this is what i want to do about thanksgiving or christmas and then that needs to be repeated many times because remember it's three degrees of the circle they're only focused in on what they want and they really do hang on to that until you have repeatedly set that limit in a very specific kind of way and don't try to give them insight or understanding about the reasons behind it that just confuses them it makes them they have no idea what why you're saying this why you're doing this to them it just works better if you keep it clean and you're not just trying to keep it clean and you're not just trying to keep it clean keep your reactivity down and repeat repeat and then when you feel deceited and bad about how they didn't listen to you that's what you expect that's them it's not a call for you to go passive and give up on yourself it's a call for you to get specific and definite and repetitive with them which are all active coping mechanisms you don't it's not good to give up and when you keep at it in a non-reactive way sooner or later i think a new norm gets set up because you just don't do it and if you say you're not going to do it and you don't do it a new norm eventually gets set up do you think that with specifically talking about emotionally immature people as you're defining them here do you think that they will honor the boundary that's set if you continue to say no i'm doing it this way or whatever i wouldn't call it honoring i think it's a good thing because that's that suggests an empathy or a respect for the other person that i don't think is probably there i think that over time it's it's kind of just think that little kids they don't say oh yes mother i understand that this is important to you and therefore i'm not going to do it anymore they're going to keep trying until they learn that this is important for me and this isn't going to happen and that's what that explains a question for me is do the parents think about what it's ashamed of do the parents get dares the grandparents think about what that means they get no matter how many times i go on about this i'm not winning and then a new norm gets established but it's it's not easy and it's not something that comes don't don't have to get emotionally reactive to it either -huh it's that's tough i mean i think managing the feelings that come up when you're it's that dynamic of one person being just no and i don't get why you don't understand this and the other person's they're having all these feelings and they're i'm trying to reach you i'm trying to reach it was just i'm turning away what's your problem stop stirring the pot or whatever every everything was fine before you're talking you're talking again there's too much words i'm trying to stay in my own head and do what i want and you're kind of this annoying mosquito absolutely yes that's it but i want to amplify one point you said that you don't encourage people to stay in relationships where they're being abused because when i when i interview people about this type of dynamic i often hear some feedback about sort of that there's more concern for the person the emotionally immature person than the person that is affected by their behavior and what i mean why is it for them to act that and that it's not sensitive to the experience of the other person in the in the relationship and i'm not saying i don't think anything in our conversation is that but i just want people to heal here very clearly that you're not neither of us is saying people should or have to stay in a relationship with anyone who's being abusive towards them you don't have to keep trying to set a boundary with someone who's being abusive towards you if you if you don't feel safe and even i mean that's that's a pretty clear-cut situation but there are other situations where i've had people who just can't stand to be around their parent i mean that they've experienced the parent as creepy or they experience the parent as going across boundaries or being intrusive and that's maybe it's not technically abused per se but it's they just don't to be around it and what i will say to people is i will just bring up the fact that they don't have to have a visit now or they don't have to respond now and i kind of leave it at that they can take breaks they can not have contact for a while i had a client once that had a new baby and she was it was everything she could do to keep her sanity with this new baby and her father who's a very was a very disruptive life character and as you may have recognized she was playing everybody around with a big fight she was brewing me up with a deal and yet our child has the wedding she had and she has to make things that simple now and make it that she can stay alive and even when i get mixed √ê√ê¬µ√ë√ê¬µ√ê latitude she was Espa√Éol her surrogacy could cost away a lot of money ended there was maybebr antibodies just to make her Wu yours to stay alive by za gay now. . I love that, that you're, you're describing the sort of the way the relationship is and with someone who's emotionally immature is that they're taking up all the space in the relationship and there's really no space for you to be you. And that the, to disentangle is to allow for space where you get to be you and then you can decide how you want to be in relationship with them. Yes. Yes. Because, , the emotionally immature person entangles with other people because they don't have a really good sense of self. They kind of merge with other people or they just associate with other people. And I think that's, I think that's a really good way to put it. . And I think that's a really good way to put it. . I think that's a really good way to put it. . I think that's a really good way to put it. . And if you assume other people are them and they assume that they're going to be there to, , help them with their emotional stabilization or shore up their self-esteem, I mean, that's the entangling part. I need you to make me feel good about myself and to keep me, , feeling calm. I need you to be the person who makes me feel that way. And if you're tired of doing that and you want to stop doing that, that's something that is very hard for them to let go. , they're not going to release you, say, oh honey, I'm sorry that, , I put you in this position of always having to take care of me emotionally. They have no idea that they're doing it. , it's hard to, it's hard to sort of remember that you have to take care of yourself and maintain a connection to yourself first and foremost before you, , step in to help anybody else. And there are lots of times, I say, where you need to create that space where you can have a connection with yourself. Because people who lose themselves get depressed. They don't function very . It's not a good scene. , true. true. , , again, I appreciate the work that you've been doing to really illuminate this dynamic and help people who are in relationship with emotionally immature people to kind of have a perspective of why it feels this, and their relationships and what they can do about it. And you're approaching this in many ways, you said, this being your fifth book. And as we talked before, there's two more in the pipeline already. By the time, , by the time this airs, , people will almost be able to maybe pre-order some of them. thank you for everything and also the brand new course you're doing too. You're doing a course on this book, ? Yes. I think that started a couple of weeks ago. It may have closed out its sign up at this point, but they're gonna continue to do sign ups for it. And that's been fun because it's been a way of me just talking to the people who are interested in this whole topic. And we talk a lot about the impact of emotionally immature parents on their adult children and what you can do to address that. it's sort of a, it's a, kind of a talking video book. . Where I get to, , talk directly to people about some of the things that they're doing. And it's not just about what we're doing here. It's just about what we're doing here. it's just , what we're doing here. . , I know that is, I just recently found out about it. I started, I shared it this week, but I don't know. Hopefully people will still be able to find out when it's going to be opening back up again. But Lindsay, just thank you much for everything you're doing to help this change. Because I think there are a lot of people who, who are raising kids who didn't get what they needed when they were young. And , we all want to do better when we know better. , hopefully it almost all of us want to, or for those of us who do, it's really, it's really valuable what you're putting out into the world. And I'm very grateful that you took the time to come back to therapy chat today. Oh, , thank you for having me. It's always such a pleasure to talk to you. I'm happy to talk with you, Laura. Oh, thank you. sweet to say that. And, and where can people find all of your stuff? . On my website, which is lindsaygibsonpsyd.com. That's my website. They can have, find information about the books and there's some of my writings and things that. And then on TikTok, I am, I'm going to be posting a lot of my stuff on there. I am doing a lot of speaking under Academy of Self-Help. There's a group of, of us therapists who are doing a TikTok presence and I'm going to be coming more into social media in the next few weeks. that'll be something that'll be coming up. I've actually managed to not do that all this time. But now I have, I have a lot of time. I'm going to be posting a lot of my stuff on there. And I know I have, I have someone who's helping me with that. that'll be coming up. Fun. It's such a good way to reach many more people. And it's amazing how people are using TikTok and Instagram videos to. , it's really good stuff. I mean, I've, I've gone through it and I love TikTok and I go through and it's , that's really good. I know it's, , some in our field are really dismissive of what people are doing. . . . , it's a little bit of a thing. It's , , we don't know if it's a good thing or not. We, we have a lot of people who are finding on social media, but I think that's a very reductive way of looking at things because, , we think, oh, social media, it's bad for everyone. , no, there are a lot of people who are accessing information that they would never have had a way to find if not for social media. . , exactly. And, , I, I think the way that it's presented in these, , these short and it and it sticks with you don't have to go through this pages of explication if somebody gets the that nugget of truth into a 30 second or a two minute thing it really sticks with you never forget it i know and sometimes they're funny and sometimes there's music and dancing and it's just you can't go wrong what's the what's that's thank you again lindsey i'm grateful that you came back to therapy chat and i hope when your next books come out we'll have you back again oh i'd love it thank you much laura
