 Self-introduction. My name is Anita and I started this program a little over four years ago  when my life had become unmanageable and I was a bottle of vodka and pills away from ending it all.  I stumbled upon Tim Fletcher and his teachings at the eleventh hour of my glorious  painful life and this journey began for me in earnest and as of July 2nd it'll be four years of  continuous sobriety for me which has been a first since I was like seven. So to continue on we're  on week four of the 50 characteristics of complex trauma. It's 50 characteristics of complex trauma  and the 50 characteristics are are benchmarks for us for somebody who has deep emotional complex  trauma wounds from our childhood. So when I came into this program I said well I'm not sure if I  have this complex trauma Tim that you're talking about so he says well check with me after you've  gone through the 50 complex complex trauma and I nail just about every one of them. So  we're gonna break down what complex trauma is for you that have just joined us here tonight.  So we define complex trauma a simple trauma is a one-time event so that could be like a car accident  or a rape or someone broke into your house and you were violated it was a one-time event.  Complex is something that's happened to us over a long period of time. So most of us that happened  when we were in our childhood usually from the age of that we can remember from five to about  15 years old so that's complex. The trauma is broken that we've broken down into four separate  categories the first one's abuse which could be physical abuse, emotional abuse, sexual abuse  and mental abuse. The second one is abandonment that's a form of trauma so a lot of kids they said well  you know what I didn't have this this kind of abuse growing up but you know my parents divorced  when I was five. I felt I felt like toilet paper on a shoe I was kind of not I kind of raised  myself the neighbors the older siblings raised me so that sense of abandonment over a long period  of time that causes deep deep emotional wounds for some kids they were put into the CFS system  that is huge abandonment issues they feel displaced they don't have a place where they feel like  this is my home this is my this is my grounding parents divorce could be a death of a parent  and then there's neglect some people say well I wasn't abused I wasn't abandoned well I'm  second youngest of five the parents decided at three they're done raising kids so me and my  little brother we were neglected we were raised by our older siblings so there was a lot in the  neglect the last category for trauma is your basic emotional my basic emotional needs not being  met there's 12 basic emotional needs I'm not going to go through them all but the most important  ones I think are unconditional love in a home acceptance respect validation kids need that  growing up we need that like lifeblood because it forms our our identity so if your basic  emotional needs aren't good if all of your needs your shelter your food your clothes that's  all being met but you've got emotional needs that are not being met over a long period of time  that's very damaging that's very wounding to us okay so Tim left off last week on nine which was  anger so today so today of the 50 characteristics of complex trauma we're at at number 10 lie  most of us learned to lie had a very young age I remember lying all the time and I wasn't until Tim  explained it to me four years ago why I lied well I lied to protect myself is to keep myself safe  the truth hurt the truth I truth got hit the truth got punished the truth was never a warm and fuzzy  thing in in a home so you know at a very young age lying became a safety a safety mechanism  that I I latched on to a really quick so most of us are afraid of getting hurt which is why we  start to lie it could be also that we're afraid of losing somebody we're afraid of having them be  angry at us so we're going to lie telling the truth they always say you can tell me anything  you can tell me anything well that those are words but are the actions matching the words  did they say you can tell me anything and as soon as you tell them like whoa you're getting punished  you're getting blasted well no then you can't tell them anything or everything so lying lying is  something that it's a survival tool we learned how to survive we learned how to cope are me  basic needs weren't being met in some way in some form or another so we're going to find another  way to get those needs met so we're going to lie now the one thing about lying though is you're  going to have to keep a file folder for everybody that you lie to I had a lot of file folders in my  cabinet and it was really tough to keep track of all the lies so you're constantly on edge you're  constantly nervous you're constantly going oh my god who's that person okay dear god what's  their file what did I tell them in the past what have I told them okay I got to go through that  file it's exhausting trying to keep up with all the lies so being authentic I never learned how to  do that I learned how to lie as an adult I did not shut it off so it could be at the end of the  day I'll come home and say why did I lie about that I didn't have to lie about that well the one  thing about lying though is we can't discern in that moment whether or not that's danger perceived  dangers real danger you know just your knee jerk reaction is I'm going to lie about that you  know because I'm going to have to keep myself safe I have to just keep myself protected  what happens though is we lie so much that the guilt is associated with all of that lying feeds  our shame and the guilt and the shame are what keep us in our addiction it keeps that's what keeps  needing something to numb the guilt and the shame so we're just we've now we're adults we're lying  we're feeding guilt and shame we don't want to do that we do it anyway we have to numb and avoid  because now I can't live with myself because I'm becoming this person I said I'd never become  and it's a cycle that you just can't get out of it's just goes over and over and over again  and then that becomes our normal next one number 11 wearing masks we learn at a very young  age if we were traumatized to wear masks why because we can't be authentic being authentic  means we're vulnerable again it's about staying safe so if you were never validated growing up  and that who you are is okay I no matter what is going on with you we're going to love you  I probably would never nobody would ever have to put a put on a mask or learn how to put on a mask  but eventually you you figure out pretty quick when you're walking on eggshells when you know  you've got an alcoholic father and an enabler as a mother and she's codependent and  they're just they're just involved in their own vortex of toxicity that I'm just I'm just watching  I'm watching to see what mask am I going to need to put on right now just to fly below the  below the radar so a wearing a mask is basically we pretend to look and act like we think others  want us to be but it's not the real us again what's our number one priority it's stay safe it's  it's we need to stay safe we're we're we've buried ourselves so far down and insulated ourselves  from staying safe from from all the dangers out there so again a survival skill that was learned  early on to protect ourselves from our abusers or bullies or anybody that is is doing us harm  but what happens is you have a lifetime of wearing masks it keeps you very disconnected from who  you truly are I didn't find out who I truly was until four years ago and I'm 54 so I had no idea  I had kept myself buried so far being authentic I didn't even I had I had a clue  so wearing masks I had millions of them I had tons and tons I had tons of friends I was out going  I was this I was this mask I was when I would always tell people I would always tell my my sister  my dear heart sister I like who I am with when I'm with that person and she didn't tell me  till years later that really scared her when I'd said that like what do you mean you like yourself  when you're with them because I would put on a mask with whoever that I was with I could I could mimic  anyone I could I'm a chameleon I was engaged to be married nine times what does that tell you  they all said you are just like me you are exactly like me I never thought I'd met anyone exactly  like me and I inside thinking no I just mirrored you back really well so again that's wearing a mask  that's nothing to do with Anita and yeah you can keep that up for a while but two years is about  my max number 12 isolate now this one here again understand all these 50 characteristics of  that are our traits of someone that has suffered from complex trauma and still does today  these are always of staying safe isolation is a big one and there are three different ways  that we isolate so we've broken it down number one is geographically geographically isolating  pretty much means you move you run you feel you feel perceived danger you feel unsafe you feel things  are just getting a little dicey run I move 52 times in 27 years from Newfoundland to BC so I lived  everywhere I was a runner I never realized that was a form of isolation again until Tim  showed me that yeah that was a form of isolation because I never I had I could start over I'm never  really getting to know people below the surface right I'm keeping myself safe keeping myself safe  so that was a form of isolation you change your friends when things get all those lies all those  fall the folders they get too much to handle well it's time to move it's time to change friends time  to change jobs it's time to change everything so that's a form of isolation second one is behind walls  now this one here is one and probably one of the first ones that we we learned as as children  because we couldn't run we couldn't fight so we learned to isolate behind walls so that's  you know putting up that wall where you know the lights on but nobody's home  we shut down emotionally so you know you my sister was a good one at that she was a reader  so she would immerse herself in her books and literally the house was being torn apart there were  punches being thrown and she looked like Anna Green Gables with her book and she was she used to tell  me I used to go in the book I couldn't hear anybody so that was a form of isolation that was behind  walls she went to a place where nothing bothered her right so that's behind walls you don't feel  anything the third way to isolate is Marie is through pseudo intimacy pseudo intimacy is fake  intimacy again guilty all those engagements all those boyfriends all of those my god this is the  love of my life I've had too many to count so basically you're going to I'm going to find a  relationship that's going to take my mind off of my reality that's a form of isolation I didn't  know that relationship junkie I was why because I didn't have to look at anything real I I was just  you know island hopping never getting below the surface of of who I am so the typical cycle of  of a relationship junkie is your first meet with two within two days you're fallen in love  within one to two meet within the week you're moving in together planning a life and within  one to two months at the relationships over next again relationship junkie it was a form of isolation  I used to think that I was an outgoing person I am I am predominantly an introvert out out the  the that outgoing nature that's a learning thing but I had to I had to keep hopping around to  different relationships and it was exhausting and it was a form of isolation and I couldn't hide  so that therefore I needed to hide behind look at all of these masks and personas and all these  just different people that I can be with all of these all of these different engagements and  it was exhausting but it wasn't me so with any form of these isolations the geographical  the pseudo intimacy and behind walls you can keep it up for a while but it doesn't last it's not  real because who we are is buried so deep down inside of us that we are not attached to the things  that we feel who we are is way down here what we do is way up here and for most of us that  that have lived through complex trauma you know a toxic environment growing up you disconnected  such a long time ago and yeah we may not be in that in that situation anymore but we don't know  how to reconnect no one's ever shown us no one ever taught us and no one ever Tim does that this  program does that but you stay disconnected right so a lot of our old wounds they say oh don't take  carry your baggage into your next relationship well you know what if you don't know what your baggage is  you're going to carry it into the next relationship any of these 50 characteristics is called  is baggage label that as the baggage that's the things that we have to identify that oh I do  that oh I do that yeah that's me too okay okay and it's not to shame us it's not to make us feel guilty  it's it's to identify and go okay that's that's where I can start from I know I know what I can start  where I can start it's funny because we I see I'm also a teacher at the React Treatment Center with  Tim Fletcher and I'm a counselor there and within the first week pretty much pretty nearly every  client will say wow I've never been real I've never been able to be who I am words and all  flaws you people are strange you guys are not talking about the weather you're talking about real stuff  and we all have the same characteristics we all have the same flaws we're all working on the same  thing so I think the greatest gift that was given me when I came into recovery was to find out  when I finally opened up I'm not alone I thought I was the only one that was weird no you guys  are all weird too and it's great so it's recovery is awesome you find it's where I found finally  fun my own tribe next one  manipulate again it was a survival skill it was a survival tool it was a coping mechanism that  we adopted at a very young age we learned that on our own and we learned it because we needed to  what happens when we were never or rarely given what we needed as children to survive we learned  to manipulate others to get our needs met if I wanted to go to my girlfriend's place on the weekend  that was seven and I wanted to have a sleep over I'd have to start with mom on Monday and doing  nice things for her and cleaning the floor and just doing for her buttering her up on Monday just  because I needed I needed to go I needed to leave I wanted I needed to be at my my friend's place my  my grandfather was a pedophile and he's sexually abused me when I was younger so I needed to get  away on my weekends so I learned to manipulate so that the answer would be yes if I asked her straight  out mom can I go stay at my dance this weekend no why because I said so I knew the answer I tried  that way so what am I going to do I learned to manipulate our caregivers they should be giving us  they should be meeting our needs our basic needs no matter what we do and how we behave  every child deserves unconditional love acceptance and validation  no matter what we do oh when I found that out I thought really I thought I had to prove myself  I we had to prove ourselves worthy before getting validation before getting praise before getting  accept before being accepted I had to earn it right that was the message that I got growing up  we learned when to and when not to ask for what we needed based on the moods of our caregivers  I always knew exactly how dad felt when he came in the door and how he put his keys on the table I  knew exactly what mood what kind of mood he was in so I I would what do I need oh okay that can  wait so I we us kids we we always kind of were way down there on the back burner because it was always  about them and their mood so trying to gauge where they're at and it's it's like I said it's a  it's a full-time job asking for directly asking directly for what we wanted needed was way too risky  because the answer could be no so we learned to become masters at convincing others to do things for  us now okay we were kids and we learned to do that we get it and yes you had a really good reason  good well now what happens when you're 30 years old and you're 40 years old and and you're still doing  that what is that why why can't we stop because it's a learned behavior it's a brain circuit that we  have been going doing over and over and over again it's our it's a nano respawns knee jerk reaction  we don't know how to stop that unless we we actively recognize it and say okay I'm going to  start making a list and a list to myself every time I manipulate I'm going to start paying attention  I am going to actively work on my manipulating of course I was doing really good with that with for  me my sister loved dearly to death didn't know that yet so I had to teach her not to manipulate  and just ask ask I'd say to her you don't have to start two days early to ask me to drive you some  place we're going to work cousins place for a games night you don't have to start two days early but  I knew what she was doing so I could I could tell her with love with gentleness and say you can just  ask I'm guaranteeing you 99.9% of the time I'm going to say yes but don't be afraid that if the  answers know I'll have a really good reason and you won't have to be afraid of being rejected she goes on  okay so manipulating that one that one's good that one's a tough one to break but you know it's  it's scary when you ask somebody hey can I get a ride downtown with you after class period  it's terrifying because the answer could be no instead I'm used to hey nice shirt you got on  there so wow how do you like class good hey yeah where you from it's good yeah well yeah me too yeah  so where do you live oh yo I know that yeah I know that area actually I'm just like the neighborhood  right over if you wouldn't by chance be okay with giving me a ride home after would you I mean I  would start I'm buttering this person up you know and it's in its manipulation and you know  that feeling you get when someone manipulates you and you feel greasy you just feel like  they just they're greasy man I just feel like well that's somebody's manipulating you we all  have that feeling and it's disgusting and it's an awful thing I did that my whole entire life but I  didn't know I was doing that it's a good one number 14 can we create what we fear we have a lot of  fears and I apologize for the photocopying that was on me messed it all up so it's all there but you  might have to look for it create what you fear we have a lot of fears if we don't know what our  fears are learn figure out who you are and what you're afraid of someone who was never validated as a  young child who has these attachment issues okay you've had a you've had a parent that never ever  praised you that didn't ever tell you hey wow you really look great today you did awesome job  you got to be good job good job you didn't you know what that's that's great for your whatever first  time validation you know what happens if you don't get that as a child you think that didn't  affect me that didn't affect me that didn't hurt me that didn't harm me I'm an adult I don't need  okay what happens when you deep down are longing for that validation because you still don't believe  that about yourself you want you want validation in your relationship so you become that stage 5  cleaner you become that person hey what you doing what what what what what what hey what do you  think of this oh what do you think of this oh do you like my new hair oh so hey did you see me  doing that wonderful thing the other day and you're just becoming this needy person and you can hear  it coming out of your own mouth and then you can hear yourself and you go oh my god I'm not person  can't stop it that's that's longing for validation if you know anybody like that or you are that  yourself that's that's childhood issues that is that long that's that little you saying I still  need to be validated I still need that what about it what if you fear most of us will fear  our significant other leaving us I don't want my love to leave me I'm afraid of that so  how do I create that I'm going to become I'm going to become that person that is a controlling  person I'm going to kind of box them in I'm going to make them all mine I'm going to do any  number of things so that they I'm afraid that they're going to leave me so I'm going to pretend  that I don't care if you leave me so in essence I'm pushing them away because I'm so trying not  to tell you how much I need you because that wouldn't be cool um this person this person  becomes very annoying and they end up creating what they fear because if they become that person  that just you can't let you go and can't give you air you're eventually going to want to  scrape them off and say please just leave me alone I want to go out with the boys tonight I just  want to go with the girls I just want to go see my mom I just I just know why why why well those  are unmet needs those are our chat that's our little less that's our little less talking listen to  it and say yeah that's about five years old but those are unmet needs um trusting relationships  everybody says they want oh I want somebody I can trust that's going to be a trustworthy person  so what are we going to do to create what we fear I'm going to check their phone check their  gas mileage gonna word ask them who were they with all day how long who was it would you  talk about I'm creating what I fear I'm afraid I'm afraid of not having this trusting relationship  but what am I doing I'm not trusting this person right I'm not trusting this person that's my  stuff that's all on me that's nothing to do with them that's all me  okay number 15 people pleaser again this one here is Anita's people pleaser I was groomed to be  a people pleaser in our home it was cute a lot of talent I could do things I love doing things with  for people I didn't get the validation I was second youngest I was going through all the neglect  and and and I needed I needed that praise and validation so I became a people pleaser I'm going to fix  people I'm going to fix people and I'm going to make everybody happy so I could walk into a situation  I could take get a beat on anybody because I've got I'm hypersensitive to everyone because I  I was groomed to be that way so I know what you need I know what you need I'm going to do for you  I used to set my guy friends up with women in the bar I don't I'd say pick one I'd say pick one  and he'd go I want that one give me give me five minutes and I'd go get that girl and I'd bring her back  because I had master manipulator people pleaser she I would do it every time it was it was a bar joke  of course I was really popular with all the guy friends but but again I wasn't doing it because I  like to doing it it was because I loved I needed the validation I was I wanted to make them happy  but the problem is is if I do and say what others want I believe that that means they're going to  love me right so I'm going to do mom's chores because then she'll love me I'm going to get  all the groceries from the car so dad doesn't have to carry him so that he'll love me  I'm going to do things for everybody so they will love me because I didn't feel loved I didn't  have my basic emotional needs met I had a roof over my head close on my back I had food in my mouth  my emotional needs I was starved I was a starving bi-affron child emotionally bi-affron  so I became that people pleaser because I want them to love me I will do what I will do for  others what they should be doing for themselves so of course you become that person that oh let me  do that for you oh let me do oh I'll do it for you why are we doing that in a relationship or  anything because they're going to get dependent on us and then they can't leave us that's why  I have ulterior motives it's not because I genuinely want to do something nice for you no strings  attached oh they're strings they're strings it's all you don't leave me I'm going to make them  dependent on me so that they can't leave yeah that works I thrive on their I thrive on their praise  and their validation again why because I didn't get I got very very little any praise and validation  I got I got from my older brothers and sisters so I grew up just starved and a dry sponge so I  became that people pleaser extraordinaire number 16 we don't know who we are so it happens when  you get sober and you stop wearing the masks because Tim points out you're wearing one and can't  isolate anymore because well that's on the table now and you you all of the things all of the unhealthy  ways that you learned to cope as a child are now all all laying on the table and you can't use  any one of them well who am I most of us don't know who we are you spend a lifetime hiding behind  masks and walls you have no idea who the real you is we have long ago detached from our true feelings  and our true selves why because we need to keep them safe I like the I like the house picture you've  got the main floor of the house there this is where people can come in people come in they visit you  yeah come on in come on in yeah it's the family room everybody comes to visit this is your house this  is you okay you got maybe like 10 people that you'll invite into your house okay that's I'll let  you in this close but that's it then you've got maybe two three people that you're going to let  into the basement not too many people because that's going a little deeper right of where you are  and who you are okay okay I'm letting two or three people and then they they think I'm close you're  my soulmate because we know everything about each other and I'm like sure sure we do no no when I  came into recovery that little door on the very bottom there a little gray door that's the  seller there's no light in there it's gravel unfinished walls and there's a dirty little little  need us sitting in the corner with her knees up and she hears all disheveled and dirty and she's  hiding and she's afraid that's who I was four years ago because I had no idea who I am because I'd  kept myself safe for so long that I had no idea who's the authentically Anita but that was okay  so when people I've been meeting in the last four years say so what do you like to do do you like  walking on the beach I'm like I'll let you know I haven't done anything sober since I was 10 so  I'm going to have to try everything again attached with my feelings to see how I feel about that  I have a response for everything but that's not authentically attached to my feelings those are just  that's just the crazy thinking in that hamster on the wheel of every situation oh that's the right  answer for that too okay right answer for that right answer for that that's just live on all  here think and think and not attached to who we are number 17 victim mentality this one  hear a lot of people get caught up in some feel very powerless over their lives you go through a  lot of trauma and and some really unpleasant memories as a child power was taken away from you  you had controlling parents you can't do this you can't do that everything that you do you can't  you can't you sleep when I tell you eat when I tell you you go out when I tell you you have  these are the friends you could have everything everything everything you become this person that  when you get out you you you're some people play the victim mine I I went to school with a girl  like this and when she finally left home she married the first guy she she she met and she became a  victim she became that victim like oh my god if you knew what what kind of life that I had you  would not you would understand why I'm sorry but you can't tell me to do anything I'm not gonna I'm  I've got oppositional defiance disorder now because I had that victim mentality  people in the victim mentality you can't move on from the past you can't move on from your past  and you can't move forward into your future you're stuck you're stuck in a rut and you can't get out  some believe that the world owes me because of what happened good I've been through this so many  people on the system they say wow shit world owes me look at me look what happened to me so many  people that I do I hear my grandparents were in the residential the sweep I I I'm old I'm a victim  here I'm a victim got passed down sure hey I'm part I'm part native too I'll get it too but you  become that victim because you just don't know how to be anything else you know you kind of get  entrapped in that and that could very well be because it's a toxic system that gets passed down  through the generations and sure that person is is feeling some of those effects from their parents  and grandparents and so on but that victim mentality that's a no-win situation you get you can't move on  from your past and you can't go into your future you are stuck some people they believe that  don't expect me to do anything I'm the victim here who are helpless me you need to take care of  me I'm the victim here this is a learned helped with helplessness a self-pity you've got different  characteristics get different personalities in a home everybody has one there they're strong  personality you've got one that I've got one of my siblings is is very much a victim he was the  weakest he was sickly he couldn't be the strongest because that role was taken he couldn't be the  most outgoing as well I had that one and and well he learned it was learned helplessness so the  only one that was kind of left he was never never validated that you know what you can do whatever  you want no no you're sick you're the sick one we don't expect anything from you  he's 50 years old and yeah he he doesn't socialize with with society anymore  false guilt this one here's fun what is true guilt the definition of true guilt is the feeling  or remorse over our that behavior something that I've done I feel true guilt over what's false guilt  it's the feeling or regret feeling of regret or remorse over someone else's bad behavior  false guilt true guilt is something I did I feel guilty for false guilt is I feel guilty because  of something my my husband my wife did my kid did I'm feeling guilty that's false guilt  where do we learn that from again most of us that's learned unhealthy caregivers may have  blamed you for what they did or how they feel and you believed them this was always one of my  favorites look at what you made me do you kids did what you were told I wouldn't have had to beat  you to your fault go bleed someplace else I was I actually remember that moment  false guilt I'm guilty I'm I'm I'm very young so I'm forming my my thoughts my perception my my  goggles of the world how I see how I perceive everything and I believed I was guilty for pretty much  everything anybody felt something bad well which is why I became the ultimate people please  are right goes hand in hand false guilt not something that you did but you're guilty over something  something somebody else does so good when I like that one next one we stopped growing emotionally  when we experience trauma as a child we stop growing emotionally at the age the trauma occurred  there are lots of little traumas that happen lots of different ages that those those are going  to happen they're going to be different ones different kinds of traumas we develop unhealthy ways of  coping or doing life because we are now in survival mode so when a child is traumatized they stop  growing emotionally and they detach from their emotions it's like a snap at sever and they go  hide but they have to still function so now as soon as that detachment helps happens they are in  survival mode and now it's it's going to be years later until you figure out how to attach that again  we develop unhealthy ways of coping doing life because we are now in survival mode we lie to get  our needs met we start stealing manipulating people bullying to get our way  some most of us in early in early recovery are emotionally we're 5 to 10 year olds living in  adult bodies when I first started my recovery four years ago I was 5 years old so good news though  I asked him I'm like oh dear God I mean I'm going to be 80 and I'll only be like 30 10 20 he's no you  grow very fast so I'm 54 but I'm about 30 now and that's been after four years so you do you  do start growing but you do stop growing emotionally and that's what happens when a child is traumatized  well not just anybody anybody's traumatized you see somebody that you know they're traumatized and  they've got that blank stare in their face you know they're in shock they're traumatized they've  detached their lights are home lights are on but nobody's home yeah they're detached you're going  to have to find some way to find them and go back and go in there and get them because that that  detachment I could life I could laugh last the lifetime and then of course then you're going to need  lots of drugs and alcohol to numb and avoid because life's going to get real real real tough  I think I have one more so in conclusion getting honest and real about our deficits can be a  humbling experience and very empowering at the same time when you recognize what your deficits are  out of these 50 make check marks goes that me yeah that's totally me it's a place to start it's  okay it's a good place to start it's humbling it hurts but it's so rewarding when you can finally  be authentic and you don't have to hide anymore it's so much easier so much easier be gentle with  yourself a lot of people they they feel the guilt and shame and say well that just proves that  I'm not a very lovable person I'm not very in a very nice person so if I admit to these  characteristics no be gentle with yourself you're just getting real there's a lot of real people  out there that are going to appreciate you uncovering some of your defects and working on them  we're not this is not about blaming ourselves or our caregivers for their shortcomings  they they lived through it as well this is a boat this is a boat recognizing the toxic  family system that was passed down to you from your parents that was passed down to them from  their parents and so on it's multigenerational I thought it was just me no I looked into my mom and  dad's history how their parents treated them shocked me blow me away I was actually at that point  really glad that I had my parents because as much as they did harmed me unintentionally harmed me  they were hurt way worse and so on and so on so that's a toxic family system that gets passed  down from generation to generation so it's not about blaming yes you can be mad at the short  comings of your caregivers it's okay to be angry there's healthy angry and the healthy anger that  Tim went over that anything that violates truth love justice and respect you can be angry over but  um yeah keep at it it's worth it it's worth it being real thank you that's pray
