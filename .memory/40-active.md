   - Coping strategy framework integration complete
   - All core components implemented and integrated
   - Status: Maintenance mode, final testing pending

3. **Real-time Intervention System (33% complete - BACKGROUND)**
   - Foundation in place, session history integration complete
   - Client state adaptation complete
   - Status: Paused for business strategy focus

### Recent Changes

**Latest Started (December 2025):**
- Business Strategy Expansion & CMS System project initiated
- Comprehensive requirements analysis completed (20 requirements)
- System architecture design completed with microservices approach
- Implementation plan created with 16 major tasks and property-based testing
- Project structure planning for TypeScript/React frontend + Python AI services

**Previously Completed (December 2025):**
- Comprehensive anonymization pipeline implementation
- Treatment outcome forecasting API and UI
- Comparative progress analysis feature
- User Acceptance Testing (UAT) suite
- Contextual Assistance Integration Testing

**Also Captured (from repository memory-bank entries):**
- Tier 1.10 Expert Validation Dataset utilities implemented (JSONL export/import + manifest + crisis-preservation validation)

**In Progress:**
- Business Strategy Expansion & CMS System (Task 1: Project structure setup)
- Core infrastructure planning and database design
- User management system architecture

## Documentation & Repository Hygiene (High Priority)

### Memory Systems
- `.memory/` (00–70) is the **source of truth** for project continuity.
- `memory-bank/` is maintained as a **mirrored/secondary** memory system for session continuity; it is kept in sync with `.memory` and should be updated immediately after `.memory` changes.

### Working Tree Status (Dec 2025)
- `00_description.md` at repo root is deleted; canonical description is `.memory/00-description.md`.
- Large NGC CLI installer binaries under `ngc_cli_v4.10.0/` are deleted from the working tree.

**Note**: The `ai/` directory (and its `training_ready/` subtree) is managed as a separate git repository; its tracking status is defined in that repo, not in this `pixelated` repo.

## Open Questions

1. **Business Strategy System Architecture**
   - Should we integrate with existing Pixelated Empathy infrastructure or create separate services?
   - How to handle business-sensitive data vs. clinical data in terms of security requirements?
   - Best approach for real-time collaboration in document editing?

2. **AI Integration for Business Intelligence**
   - How to leverage existing MentalLLaMA models for market analysis?
   - Should we create specialized models for competitive intelligence?
   - Integration patterns between business AI services and clinical AI services?

3. **Data Management Strategy**
   - Separate databases for business strategy vs. clinical data?
   - How to handle export/import between business strategy system and external tools?
   - Backup and disaster recovery for business-critical strategy documents?

## Blockers

### Current Blockers

1. **None Currently Identified**
   - All active work is progressing
   - No critical dependencies blocking progress

### Potential Blockers

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - May require architectural changes
   - Could impact existing functionality
   - Needs careful planning and testing

2. **Supabase RPC Functions**
   - Complex nested updates may require database functions
   - Need to design and implement atomic operations
   - Testing and validation required

## Next Actions

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Set up Business Strategy Expansion project structure and infrastructure
2. Create TypeScript project structure with proper module organization
3. Set up database connections (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis)
4. Configure authentication and authorization middleware
5. Set up API routing and error handling framework
