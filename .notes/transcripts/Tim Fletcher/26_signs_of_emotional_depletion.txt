What are some of the indicators that I am depleted or I'm getting close to being depleted? So either my gas tank's almost empty or it is empty. It's interesting that they have found that people that are depleted aren't able to grip things and hold them for as long as they normally would if they're feeling energetic. If they have lots of resources and their gas tanks are full. So maintaining grip on something is reduced. That's a very interesting indicator. But some of the ones that you can be more practically in touch with would be people that are depleted often start to deviate in their diet. They're not eating as well. They're not eating as good a food. They're binging. They're snacking more. Or they're not eating as. Much as they should. So those around food can be indicators. Often people that are depleted become impulsive in spending money. And so it's their brain looking for pleasure. Their brain looking for an escape. But they start to find themselves wanting to make impulsive spending decisions. People who are depleted usually are. More. Irritable. And so they begin to react. Aggressively. In situations that really don't call for it. So the slightest little provocation and they overreact to that. So that's a very important indicator. That irritability overreaction. People who are depleted often. Their cognitive abilities aren't as sharp. Their brain is slow. Their brain is fuzzy. They have trouble with cognitive tasks. They have trouble with decision making. So it starts to affect their ability to think properly. Often when people are depleted they begin to lose motivation. So they notice their motivation is lacking. It's not what it should be or normally is. People who are depleted find that when they're with people. They just don't want to put the energy into being present. It's like when the person's talking it's oh. When. I wish. They would shut up. Because I just don't want to sit and listen. So there's a resistance now to wanting to be present to other people. People are depleted. Their parasympathetic nervous system starts to want to forcibly kick in. And sometimes that does that through. They start to get depression. Happening because they're running out of. Gas in their gas tank. So depression starts to happen. Or with that they start to get anxiety for no apparent reason. They're just all of a sudden they wake up and they're feeling anxious. And they don't know why. It could be they're just depleted. Or some there's starts to be an emotional roller coaster. So they feel really great. And then one little thing happens and they just feel terrible. They feel depressed. And it's like whoa, where's my emotional stability? I'm all over the map. Emotionally in a given day. Others with that. They can be sitting watching TV and all of a sudden there's a commercial that comes on and they find themselves crying. And they go, whoa, that's not how I normally am. What's going on here? And so they're just emotionally more vulnerable. That could be from emotional depletion. And then others all of a sudden they realize their bubble, their boundaries bubble has grown. They just don't. Want people around. Don't want people in the same room as them. Even in the house, same house with them. So their bubble just changes. That can be a sign of depletion as well. So again, be aware of your signs when you're emotionally depleted is so important because once you see that warning sign, you can stop and go. Okay, what's going on here? Why am I more irritable today? Why do I not want to be present today? Oh, I'm depleted. Why am I depleted? That becomes the process you go through. But there's another level of self-awareness here and that is to be aware of your old tendencies that you naturally fall into when you are depleted. And so these often you fell into subconsciously. You weren't even aware that you were falling into it because you weren't even aware you're depleted. This all happened. And patterns develop subconsciously that weren't healthy. And so it's becoming aware of those things. So for many people, what happened when they were depleted? They just dissociated. They just checked out. They weren't present to themselves. They weren't present to anybody. They went into a fantasy world. They just went into some internal zombie land. It's important to understand that because what happens for many people? In recovery is that's what they think self-care is. When it gets too much you just check out. And so their self-care always is a check out type of thing. A dissociative type of thing which isn't necessarily healthy self-care at all. Others, when they were depleted, they automatically began to overindulge in something pleasurable. So food, sex, TV, playing a game. Video game. So all of a sudden it was just let's overindulge in this pleasurable activity. That was their way of self-care. Which again, having some of that with good boundaries can be healthy. But for most people with complex trauma that went into unhealthy territory. For others, what happened to them, their tendencies when they're depleted is, Oh, I need connection. But their brain doesn't go, I need healthy connection. Their brain goes, I need sex. I just need sex. That's what I'm needing right now. So their brain has over years of getting the wires crossed about what, how to meet their needs. So my need is connection. Their brain has begun to think my need is actually sex. Or my need is truly I need emotional empathy and nurture. But their brain, it goes, I need food. Because grandma always said, Here's a cookie that'll make you feel better. And so they've been mistrained as to what their need is and how to meet that need. Some people, once they feel they need self-care because of depletion, their brain always goes to something that is a junk food thing. Let's go get drunk. Let's just eat junk food. Let's just do something that they know is unhealthy. But that's what their brain just seizes. Self-care. Let's break the rules. Let's just self-indulge. So be aware of that. Some, they weren't allowed self-care as a kid. They were told they were being lazy or selfish if they relaxed. And so now when they start to get depleted and they feel the need for self-care, they go, I just need to go and help somebody. I just need to be busy and take on a project. That's where their brain goes. Others, when they are feeling depleted, they just go to distractions. I'm just going to stay busy. I'm going to organize. I'm going to do stuff so I don't feel. And that's been their way of coping. Others, I just need instant gratification. And so I'm going to go shopping. And their whole focus becomes, I just need to feel good right now. And instant gratification becomes their idea of self-care. Some, they go into a victim mentality when they're depleted. Poor me. My life sucks. They feel sorry for themselves. They tell everybody about how hard their life is, about how tired they are. That's what they think is the solution. And that can actually feed something very unhealthy. Some, when they start to feel depleted, they go to avoid procrastinating. That's what their brain thinks is self-care. Just start avoiding everything, procrastinating on everything. Some people, when they're feeling depleted, they go, I'm in a crisis. I'm going to go to a professional and get the professional to magically fix me. That's what they think. That's what they think is the answer to being depleted. Some, when they're depleted, they've learned, I'll just go get my friends to do stuff for me. And they start to use their depletion as a way to get attention and manipulate people to do stuff for them that they should be doing for themselves. And it's only crisis management stuff that's not really taking care of the deep needs properly. Other people, when they're depleted, they just go, I need to medicate myself. I need help to relax. And so they self-medicate. Others, their solution when they're depleted is, people are too much, so I just need to isolate and withdraw from people and not connect to anybody, because that takes too much energy. All of those might make you feel better for a minute, in your limbic brain, but they make things worse in the long run. That's what I want you to see. So be aware of your unhealthy self-care tools, your unhealthy patterns for when you're depleted. And most of those have happened at a subconscious level. So let's go to healthy self-care. And what I want you to realize is that there's two levels of healthy self-care. There's that in the moment when I am depleted and I realize it, what do I need to do now to take care of myself, to get some energy? So you're basically kind of in a crisis mode or on the verge of crisis, and you're needing to fix some things right now. So that's one level of self-care. But I hope you're seeing there's a deeper level of self-care. That is, I need to meet all 12 of those levels of my needs on a regular basis. And if I don't learn to do that, I'm going to keep cycling back to crisis stuff where I'm depleted over and over and over again. But if I learn to meet all 12 of my needs on a regular basis, then I won't get depleted. So that's the better self-care that we're wanting to learn. So learn to meet your 12 needs. And that means growing in mindfulness. That means learning to detect when a need is not being met. So again, we've done talks on this that hopefully you can go through and that will help you learn how to do this. But that's what self-care really is, is I am learning to take care of myself, not just my physical needs, but my emotional needs, my intellectual needs, my relational needs, spiritual needs. All of those needs, I am learning to meet consistently. And I am learning how to detect when those needs aren't being met. So important. And you might need to ask somebody to help you as you figure out how to do that. Secondly, self-care always will involve an element of connection with myself and with at least one other person at a deep, caring, vulnerable level. That is, such an important piece of self-care. So don't lose sight of that. Self-care, there's an element you can do all by yourself. Do it alone, but there's an element of connection that is always going to be needed because that is one of our needs. Next, part of self-care, especially the crisis stuff, when I am depleted, is I need to learn emotional regulation. I need to learn how to manage all of the stuff that's coming up because I am depleted. So I'm irritable. I need to be able to manage that. I'm feeling some discontent. I need to learn how to sit in that. I'm feeling some anxiety and depression. I need to learn how to manage that. So there's always going to be elements of self-regulation and learning healthy self-soothing that are part of self-care. Let me take it a wee bit deeper. To be able to take care of yourself in a healthy way means I need to put a higher priority on my own pleasure and enjoyment. Now to some people that immediately sounds wrong. That I am being proud, that I am being selfish, that I am being a narcissist. Not if it's healthy. Do you realize that you can't love others from an empty cup? So if you're a narcissist, you can't love others from an empty cup. So if you're not filling your own gas tanks, your own cup, you're never going to be able to love others properly. So life is loving others but also to love others I have to love myself. And so for many people from complex trauma, they have to place their needs on a higher priority than they've been placing them. And that's definitely going to feel wrong but it's so important. The next thing is part of self-care and meeting my needs is meeting my needs with things that my needs need. So I have to figure out my likes and dislikes. I have to feel out what feeds my soul, what causes me enjoyment. So hobbies, things that I can do that just are fulfilling for me. So I need to figure out those things. Self-care has to have self-compassion. As long as there's that negativity towards myself, I'm going to stay depleted. So somebody has said it's the golden rule in reverse. Do to yourself as you would do to others. So you're great at taking care of everybody else. So now treat yourself the same way. That is an important part. Become aware of that internal self-directed, directed anger at yourself that can be so damaging. So that can come out as shame. That inner critic that's always criticizing you. False guilt, true guilt. But so many people just have this constantly directed anger at themselves. Become aware of that. And then develop rather than that internal critic that's always finding fault and putting you down and saying harsh things to you and judging you. Find a loving internal voice. It's still firm. It's still your cortex. It's a good parent that's pointing out things. But it's a loving, compassionate internal voice. And then allow yourself to be human. We have limitations. We can't do everything. We can't go without sleep, without food. We can't go 24-7. We need breaks. We're human. And part of self-care is learning to accept my humanness. Next one in self-care is don't let your limbic brain be your only guide. So you need to listen to your limbic brain and go, oh, I am just feeling irritable. Oh, I am just feeling anxiety and depression. I need to listen to that and go, what's going on? But what my limbic brain then wants to do is if I just listen to my limbic brain, oh, I'm feeling so irritable, so tired. I just need to sit and do nothing all day today. So my limbic brain can identify that something's not right. But often the solutions that the limbic brain then provides can be dangerous. Sitting all day and doing nothing, that could be terrible. It might only meet one need, physical rest. I need to meet all 12 needs. I could be lacking in 10 other areas right now. And sitting all day is not going to meet those other 10 areas. And so just listening to my limbic brain's solution is not always wise. All that the limbic brain is aware of is what it's feeling most intensely. It's not necessarily aware of what is happening underneath that. And so I need to get to my cortex. And this is so important. When I am feeling depleted, my limbic brain is triggered, and I need to pay attention to that. But then I need to get to my cortex and I need to begin to investigate without judgment, with curiosity, and ask myself some questions. What needs haven't been met lately? What's been going on in my life that maybe is causing greater stress, greater anger? What's been happening? What would help meet my needs right now? What should I change? What should I do that's going to help to meet those needs? Have I been neglecting in my life any of the things that I had built into my life that were important for keeping me in a healthy place, that were meeting all of the needs? So what happens to a lot of people is when they're in crisis, they go, I need to start getting up every morning and having time just to do yoga, to meditate, to just be quiet and check in with myself and be mindful. And they set up a routine and it begins to really start to bring about positive changes and really good. And then what happens is, okay, I'm feeling good. I don't need to do that stuff anymore. And pretty soon they're depleted again. And so what you need to be able to go do is say, have I been neglecting any of the activities that once were very important in my recovery? Things that were feeding my soul and meeting my needs. And then that mindfulness, where is my stress level at? Where is my anger at? Where is my fatigue at? Where is my anxiety at? Where is my depression at? Why that's important is because for many people with complex trauma, I'm not aware of depression or anxiety or stress until it hits a 10 out of 10. I need to stop and maybe it's only at a four, but whoa, okay, why is it at a four when it's 10? Why is it at a one? It's usually at a two. I need to be able to become aware of the more subtle emotions when they're not at that intense point. So let me end by saying this, this part of self-awareness and doing that self inventory and figuring out what's going on, for many people, they need to stop for a half an hour and be really quiet and get centered and grounded and connected to their body and connected to their emotions before they can ask those questions. If I was to go to some people that are depleted and go, where's your stress level at? Oh, I haven't been stressed. Oh, where's your depression at? Oh, no, I'm not depressed. In their mind, they aren't because they haven't connected yet. They're still in a disconnected place and they're talking from a disconnected place that's not feeling those things so they don't think they have those things. And so get yourself to a place where you can be quiet for a period of time, away from distractions and truly connect. And as you do that, then you're able to do that inventory. So this becoming quiet, what are the signs I am depleted? What depletes me? What are the signs I am depleted? I think this is such an important part for many, many people coming out of complex trauma to become aware of. And then, what do I need to do when I am depleted to get myself back on track? What do I need to do on a daily basis so I don't keep sliding into getting depleted? Such important tools to learn. So I hope this has been helpful as we head into a new year that it will just help you on your journey.
