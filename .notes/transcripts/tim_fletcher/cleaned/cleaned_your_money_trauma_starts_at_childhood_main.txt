So tonight we are back on this healthy tools.  So I said in the very first talk in this series that if a person is going to deal with their addiction and their complex trauma, basically you got to get healthy.  So two part or three parts to getting healthy, the first is self-awareness and that's understanding all the unhealthy ways I act and the patterns of unhealthy that are taking place in my life and starting to be aware of that and then secondly I have to learn what healthy looks like and thirdly I got to learn tools to get to healthy.  So that's what this series is about and tonight we are coming to the topic of money and what I am really focusing on is how do we meet the needs that we have in healthy ways and the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for healthy ways and the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for And the last two weeks we talked about how do we meet the need for food and pleasure and in order to get food and sometimes to get pleasure you got to spend money.  So money is not not actually a first need but it's a need in order to get some needs met and money is a huge issue and so I want to break it down three different ways.  First is money in general for people no matter how healthy they are is a challenge.  Money is this thing that's just a necessary part of life.  You cannot live without it but it is very tricky to manage.  It might seem like it's kind of an insignificant thing but you begin to realize that it is connected to just about everything we do and we can go wrong with money in a thousand different directions.  And the number one cause of conflict that studies say in marriages today is that we need to be healthy.  So money is money.  So it causes all kinds of issues.  So money is very easy to misuse.  And it's also very easy to develop the wrong attitude toward no matter who you are.  What I have learned over the years is if I want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on.  So money reveals a lot about you and what's important to you and what's not important to you.  So if you want to know the priorities of a person watch what they spend their money on.  So money reveals a lot about you and what's important to you.  So that's just in general.  So money is a challenge for everybody.

But it's an even greater challenge for people in recovery.  And I got quite a long list and some of you will relate to every single one of the points that I am going to make.

But the first major issue around money and recovery is that money can be a trigger to use.  And what I have seen over years in working with people in recovery is that for some people that very first payday once they are in recovery also becomes relapse day.  Because they get that first paycheck and their brain goes to boy let's party.  The second thing that can happen with people is just even having money in your pocket is a trigger.  I know some addicts who when they get their paycheck they spend it all just to get rid of the money so they are not going to be tempted.  They do not have any money left for groceries but they spend it all and the temptation is gone.  And so money can be a huge trigger especially when you begin to look at meth being sold for less money.  And so even having a little bit of money can be a problem.

But not just having money can be a trigger.  Not having money can also be a trigger for some people.  And so if you do not have money, you are not going to be tempted.  And so if you do not have money, you are not going to be tempted.  So not having money can be a trigger to start your boosting career up again and getting some money or do a few bit of dealing, deal some drugs, get some quick money or turn a couple of tricks and get some fast money.  And so not having money can be a trigger.  And then for some people, having a credit card or a debit card is just too big of a trigger.  It is something that they cannot do.  It is something that they cannot handle.  So if you are in recovery, you probably relate to some degree to that.  And then on top of that is gambling addiction, shopping addiction and all of that is money related.  Now let's say you get in a relationship.  Then you have money becomes this cause or source of conflict but also stress.  I do not know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who do not have money.  I do not know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who do not have money.  I do not know many people coming into recovery out of addiction who do not have debts.  They do not have a huge saving account.  That's all been gone.  They got a lot of debt.  And debt adds a lot of stress to life.  Then for many people coming in out of complex trauma, your brain is still instant gratification.  And so part of what you have done in your life is just make lots of impulsive decisions.  So you buy stuff before you thought about it.  Just because you feel like buying it in that second of time.  And so impulsive decisions can mean coming home with a new TV and laptop.

But then the stress that comes up after that and the conflict that comes after that is great.  And then some people get in a relationship and they spend a whole bunch of money and they come home and they did not ask the other person if it was okay to go and buy something.  And then they go and spend $500.  They just did it and now they have got a huge conflict.  I have found that the majority of people in recovery would brand themselves as poor money managers.  There's some that manage money well, but those are the exception.  Most have not learned how to manage their money.  And so they tend to waste money and then struggle to pay bills.  All of that adds stress and creates conflict.  Some who come out of complex trauma have hoarding issues.  And I am going to talk about that a little bit later.

But that is tied in with the money thing and that can become a source of great conflict.  Not just with a partner but with family and friends as well.  And then many people that come out of complex trauma, even poverty and addiction, can have a very distorted view of success.  And they can come into recovery thinking that if I just get enough money to buy what I want, then I will be happy.  So their definition of happiness and success is tied into getting lots of money.  And they set themselves up for disappointment.  I also have encountered many clients, who grow up in a family where parents have defined success by the possessions you own, the house you live in, and so the child still gets pressure from the parent to have certain things to prove that they are successful.  And the parent wants the child to have it because that child is an embarrassment to the parent if they do not have it.  So they get lots of pressure.  And our culture gives us the same message.  I have also found that many clients coming out of complex trauma and poverty often look at people with lots of money and because they wear a smile in public, they think those are happy people.  And then they are envious of them.  And they walk around saying, if I just had what they had, then I would be happy.  And I often say, do you know anything about their private life?  Because just because they wear a smile does not mean they are happy.

But that is what can easily happen.  And so one of the things that's really important to understand up front is this.  Money is a big part of what is necessary to meet needs.  And so what is very easy to think is that more money is the solution to my problems.  I hope you know that that's a lie.  That just having external things does not make me a happy person.  That happens from a healthy internal life, not from more things.  Okay, now it's really hard for people in addiction to manage money when they come into recovery.

But let me take it to the third level.  And that's the challenges for people with complex trauma.  And there's two main areas I want to focus on, and then I will add a couple extra after that.  If you come from complex trauma, life for most people in complex trauma is unstable.  You are not sure what mood dad's going to be in today, so that is iffy all the time you walk on eggshells.  Some of you do not know if you are going to have food to eat on any given day, because mom and dad spend it all on drugs and alcohol.  So there's lots of fighting that makes life unstable.  Parents are not consistent.  They are not a rock.  And so your life is marked by instability.  And that is what creates some of the trauma.  Because you feel like a little child, all alone, facing all of this instability, and you do not feel strong enough to handle it.  So you are traumatized by it.  What is easy for people to do as they get older is think that if I have lots of money in the bank, then that will be what gives me stability.  That is a lie.

But it is really easy to think that, because if you have got lots of money in the bank, then you think I can handle anything that comes up that might make my life unstable.

But again, it's looking for stability.  You are looking for stability in external only.  And that will let you down.  And so many people begin to think, especially in our culture, that if I want a safe and stable and secure future, I need to squirrel all my money away so that I am prepared.  Now it's wise to be prepared financially for the future if you can, but that should not be the main source of stability.  Now what can happen also if a person thinks that way is they begin to then think, I need lots of money or my future is insecure, so I better be a workaholic.  And then they work and work and they lose their kids, they lose their marriage, because money now is in control of their life.  And that is a very dangerous thing.  So be careful and be aware if you find yourself looking to money to fill that security need.  It will disappoint you.  Second one, and this is probably the biggest one, is to see money and shame, money and my sense of value.  So what happens in complex trauma is you end up with this thing called shame.  So you feel the reason I was neglected and abandoned and abused is I am bad.  Something's wrong with me.  I am not good enough.  And so you develop a core belief that says I am not good enough, I am not valuable.  So what can then happen is a whole bunch of things that will intersect with money.  So first one, some of you with lots of shame, just the fact that you are poor today feeds your shame and triggers your shame and seems to prove to you that you are not good enough because you are still poor.  So be aware of that one.  Some of you are on EIA and you have to be on EIA but your family is embarrassed that you are not working for a living.  And so that can become a source of shame if you are on EIA.  And some of you might then want to get a job but you cannot because of mental health limitations because you need to work on getting a solid recovery in place.

But your family keeps saying, why are not you working yet?  You should be a responsible parent and you are not.  And they feed your shame.  So be aware of those things.  I have had many clients say I got to quit recovery, quit treatment and go back to work.  Because I got to prove that I am the provider for my family.  And I say, I do not see this turning out well.

But they feel that pressure and it's shame driven.  Okay, next thing.  If you grew up with lots of shame and you figured everybody looked down on you and nobody respected you because after all they did not respect you at home.  Boy, if you had money, people all of a sudden respected you.  And so now you are thinking money is what gains me respect.  Secondly, if you grew up with lots of shame then you did not feel like you fit in anywhere.  You never belonged.  You felt all alone in a crowd.  And then as soon as you had lots of money, man, you had friends coming out of your ears.  Everybody wanted to be your friend.  You all of a sudden fit in.  And you go, wow, money helps me belong.  And you get that message into your brain.  Another part of shame is you feel like a total failure.

But now when you got money that proves you are not a failure.  It proves you are a success.  And so now you see money as a solution to feeling like a failure to proving that you are a success.  Then part of shame is I have to wear a mask.  Because if people get to know the real me they will reject me like everybody else has.  And so money enables you to establish an image that people like.  And people respect.  And so again it seems to make or become the solution to your problems.  And the final shame one, shame makes me feel inferior.

But if I have lots of money, I feel superior to everybody else.  So for people coming from complex trauma, my point is it creates, because of shame, all kinds of ways to have the wrong relationship with money and to believe lies about money.  And that's what I want you to be aware of.  Okay, third thing that happens with complex trauma, you feel this constant emotional emptiness and pain.  And guess what money lets you do?  Buy medication.  You can buy drugs, alcohol, and activities and have endless distractions that take you out of the pain and give you some pleasure.  And so again people can think money is the solution to my pain and money is solution to my emptiness.  And then whenever you are discontented, money buys you stuff to do.  Money gives you that high for a little while and it seems to fill the emptiness inside of you.  Now be aware of another part of complex trauma and that is you create a complex trauma in your kids, most likely.  And what happens with that is you carry this guilt.  And what can happen if you are struggling to pay the bills, you feel extra guilty that you cannot get your kids lots of gifts.  And so I have seen many people go into debt further because their guilt at not giving their kids all the nice things of our culture has driven them to a very bad decision.  And then that can add a whole bunch of stress later.  So do you see that?  All of those things that have developed there coming out of complex trauma is distorted perspectives on money.  And those distorted perspectives on money can result in having the wrong attitude toward money.  And that's what I want you to think about right now.  So understand up front, money is not a bad thing.  Money is neutral.  I hear clients say, sometimes, money is the root of all evil.  And I say, you have not read your Bible, if that's what you think.  The Bible says the love of money is the root of evil.  Not anything wrong with money, it's my attitude toward money.  That's the issue.  And so that's what I want you to understand is it's really easy to have the wrong attitude toward money.  Especially in the culture we live in.  Especially because of the complex trauma distortions.  And so what happens though is if I develop the wrong attitude toward money, money becomes like a drug.  It seems to solve my problems, but it only makes it worse.  Exactly like a drug.  And so money is something that you can easily become addicted.  So the wrong attitude toward money is called greed.  And I want to talk about that.  Greed is wanting more money, living to get more money, thinking that having more money will make me happy and will meet all of my needs.  Now some people have said to me over the years, I do not have greed after I am poor.  And I go, okay, let's just see if we can figure out how do we tell if we have greed.  Realize that some of the wealthiest people in the world are super greedy and some of the poorest people in the world are just as greedy.  They just have not had the opportunity.  It does not mean they do not have the attitude.  So what are some of the indicators?  Now this is tricky, okay?  So what I am going to do is give you different things that could be indicators, but they are not necessarily indicators.  So a workaholic.  That could definitely be greed.  Somebody saying, I need more, I need more, I need more.

But that could also be somebody that just says, I have got lots of children and I have to pay the bills and I have got to be a responsible adult, so I have got to work extra hours as much as possible.  So that could be a good thing.  Okay?  Then you go the other extreme, a cheapskate.  So some of you, oh, I used to say about my grandma that she was so cheap that when she opened her wallet and she fell out, the queen blinked.  Because it had not seen the light for a long time.  In case you did not get that joke.  Okay.  So a cheapskate could be somebody that just manages their money very well.  And they are very careful not to waste money, to save money, and some people are going to look at them and go, what a cheapskate.  Other people who are a cheapskate are driven by greed.  I am not going to spend a penny on you because I want it for me to create wealth.  So that can be a greed.  A hoarder.  A hoarder can be greed, but do you realize that hoarding, for the most part, comes out of complex trauma.  It is a person who's gone through abandonment.  And so part of their brain finding a solution so they think to abandonment is just to collect things.  So they will not get abandoned by things.  They cannot let go of stuff.  So hoarding could be greed, but it could be deep abandonment issues.  Next one.  A person who's in debt.  That could be greed.  They want something so badly they spend it even though they do not have the money.  Or it could be somebody that just made some bad decisions earlier in life and now they are living with the consequences.  So again, you have to sort that out.  Theft, it could be greed.

But I suspect there's some of you who theft gave you a high.  There was the rush.  And that was the addiction.  And so that was not necessarily greed.  That was a totally different motivation behind theft.  Now I have some people say to me, I give lots of money to people.  How could I be greedy?  And I go, well, you are a multi-millionaire.  And so for you to give $1,000, that's not really generous in light of how much money you have.  So I do not see you making any big sacrifices to give.  I see you just giving out of your surplus.  So you could still be very greedy even though you are giving.  So those are just some indicators in case you wanted to check if you are greedy or not.  If you are, here's the results.  You want to know that greedy people always end up with resentments?  Because the world's giving them a bad deal.  Because all this money's not satisfying them.  And people are not cooperating with their program.  And so they are mad at everybody.  And then they have lots of fights in their relationship.  And you want to know one of the main indicators of greed?  And the consequences is you worry all the time about money.  It's constantly an obsession.  So what can happen with greed is that you start out and you go, money is going to serve me.

But over time, you now serve money.  And money is the boss of your life.  Now here's the saddest part of greed.  I could take you to somebody where their dad told them that he loved them all the time and their dad did many nice things for them, but their dad loved money more than them.  And at some point in the child's life, they realize, dad loves me as long as it does not interfere with his money.  And then the money becomes more important than me.  You know how much that hurts a child when they realize dad loves his car more than me?  Dad loves getting money more than me?  That is devastating.  And so when you are greedy, at some point in your life, at some point in a relationship, your greed will trump loving other people.  And your greed will come before loving them.  And it will do a lot of damage.  So let's go to how do we learn to manage money, have a healthy relationship with money.  Again, this is one of the things in our culture that our culture teaches an awful lot about, so I am not going to go through every healthy thing.  You can go to budgeting classes, etc.  There's lots of different stuff out there to help you.

But do learn money management.  And so when you manage money, there's three things really.  Saving, spending, and giving.  Okay?  So that's three different areas for money.  And then what I find with many people is distinguish between a need and a want.
