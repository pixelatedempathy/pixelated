Set task 'Use edit_file to update src/pages/demo/chat.astro...' to 'Completed'
Set task 'Use edit_file to update...' to 'Completed'
Edit filesrc/pages/demo/chat.astro
Great! The bias-detection demo is already using the brutalist design system. Now let me update the chat.astro demo page
to use the brutalist components:

Set task 'Use grep to search for...' to 'Completed'
Search for 'BrutalistButton' in files in '.'
Search for 'BrutalistCard' in files in '.'
Perfect! I can see that the bias-detection.astro page is already using the brutalist design system, so it looks good.
Now let me check for the brutalist components in the codebase and update the chat.astro demo page:

Set task 'Use read_file to examine the...' to 'Completed'
Set task 'Use read_file to examine the...' to 'Completed'
Set task 'Use read_file to examine the...' to 'Completed'
Set task 'Use read_file to examine the...' to 'Completed'
Set task 'Use find_files to locate all...' to 'Completed'
Now let me set the completed tasks and continue with the remaining ones:

Read filesrc/pages/try-demo.astro
Read filesrc/pages/demo/chat.astro
Read filesrc/pages/demo/bias-detection.astro
Read filesrc/styles/brutalist-dark.css
Search files with pattern '*brutalist*.css'
Now let me examine the brutalist CSS and existing demo files to understand the current structure:

Set task 'Use find_files to locate all...' to 'Completed'
Perfect! Now I can see the demo pages are in src/pages/demo/. Let me start the task properly and set the first task as
completed:

Search files with pattern '*.astro'
I don't see a pages directory. Let me search for any astro files:

Using list_dir: directory=src
Using list_dir: directory=.
Let me check the current directory structure:

Search files with pattern 'src/pages/*.astro'
Search files with pattern 'src/pages/*demo*.astro'
Search files with pattern 'src/pages/demo/*.astro'
Now let me continue with the task that was cut off - updating the demo pages. I'll start by finding all the demo files
and reading the current bias-detection.astro file:

Review the proposed plan. Then ask questions or request changes. To execute the plan, select Approve plan.

Create plan with 22 tasks
I'll analyze the goal and create a comprehensive plan to update all demo pages and blog with the new brutalist design
system for this mental health project.

Based on the context, it appears the user was in the middle of updating demo pages with a brutalist design system but
encountered errors. The goal is to complete the frontend UI redesign using a dark mode brutalist style that's welcoming
for mental health users (avoiding purple colors).

Let me create a detailed plan:

The user wants to continue updating their mental health project's demo pages with the established brutalist design
system. They've identified specific priority demos: crisis-intervention, bias-detection, personality-disorders,
cultural-competency, chat, clinical-vault-trainer, and mentalhealthchat.

Key Context: The project already has a comprehensive brutalist design system implemented (brutalist-dark.css) with
mental health-friendly colors (greens/blues, no purple), flat styling, and components like BrutalistCard,
BrutalistButton, and BrutalistBadge. The bias-detection demo is already updated as a reference.

The user's approach is strategic - they want to complete several main demo pages first to get a feel for the overall
design flow before making final decisions about the brutalist direction. They prefer demos over blog pages initially and
don't need a specific update order. Previous technical errors were resolved and shouldn't block progress.

The task is clear: update the identified demo pages using the existing brutalist components and styling system, allowing
the user to evaluate the complete user experience flow across multiple pages before finalizing the design direction.

demo/crisis-intervention, demo/bias-detection, /demo/personality-disorders, /demo/cultural-competency, chat and
clinical-vault-trainer, and mentalhealthchat would be good too. 2. No help currently. It was you that errored out. 3. I
don't have an order. 4. Demos first. 5. Honestly I haven't looked at it yet. I want to get these main pages together
first, so I can feel the flow, THEN decide if I like it. One or two pages, I can't really get a true grasp

Your request appears to reference previous work that encountered technical errors while updating demo pages with the
brutalist design system. To help you continue effectively, I need clarification on your next steps.

I'm ready to help with your project but I need a few key details:

Specify which demo page you'd like to update first (chat.astro, clinical-vault-trainer.astro, etc.)
Clarify if you need help resolving the technical errors that occurred with file editing
Define the priority order for updating the remaining demo pages
Specify if you want to focus on demo pages or blog pages first
Confirm if you want to maintain the same brutalist styling approach established in bias-detection.astro
I have analyzed your Pixelated Empathy project and understand the current state of your brutalist design system
implementation:

Current Status:

You were in the middle of updating all demo pages and blog with the new brutalist design system
The brutalist design system is fully implemented with comprehensive CSS (src/styles/brutalist-dark.css)
Brutalist components are available: BrutalistCard, BrutalistButton, BrutalistBadge
The project is a mental health/therapy training platform
What's Been Completed:

bias-detection.astro demo page is fully updated with brutalist styling
demo-hub.astro, features.astro, and index.astro are using brutalist components
Comprehensive brutalist CSS system with dark mode, proper typography, mental health-friendly colors
The design follows brutalist principles with flat styling, sharp edges, bold typography
What Still Needs To Be Updated:

Demo Pages Not Yet Updated:

chat.astro - still using old ChatDemo component and basic styling
clinical-vault-trainer.astro
emotion-progress.astro
emotion-visualization.astro
enhanced-bias-detection.astro
fhe.astro
psychology-pipeline-processor.astro
psychology-pipeline.astro
security-bias-detection-engine.astro
synthetic-training-generator.astro
Blog Pages:

blog/index.astro - still using standard Tailwind classes instead of brutalist components
Design System Features Available:

Dark mode optimized colors (mental health friendly - greens and blues, no purple as requested)
Brutalist typography with strong font weights
Flat, sharp-edged components
Status indicators and badges
Grid layouts and containers
Proper accessibility features
JetBrains/Sublime Text inspired code blocks
The brutalist design maintains the welcoming feel for a mental health platform while providing the flat, bold aesthetic
you wanted, inspired by the examples you shared (Shelve, Teton, Meter, etc.).

Read filesrc/pages/blog/index.astro
Using list_dir: directory=src/pages/blog
Search files with pattern 'src/pages/blog/*.astro'
Let me check if there are any blog pages that also need updating:

Using list_dir: directory=src/pages/demo
Search for 'brutalist' in files in 'src/pages'
Now I understand the current state of the project. Based on the context you provided, I can see that:

You were in the middle of updating demo pages with a new brutalist design
The project has existing brutalist components (BrutalistCard, BrutalistButton, BrutalistBadge)
There's a comprehensive brutalist dark mode CSS system in place
The project is a mental health/therapy training platform called "Pixelated Empathy"
You were working on updating demo pages like bias-detection.astro and chat.astro
Let me gather more information about what was happening and what needs to be completed:

Read filesrc/styles/main.css
Now let me check the current main.css to see what needs to be integrated:

Read filesrc/styles/brutalist-dark.css
Search files with pattern '**/*.css'
Now let me check the main stylesheet to understand the current brutalist styling:

Read filesrc/components/ui/BrutalistBadge.astro
Read filesrc/components/ui/BrutalistButton.astro
Read filesrc/components/ui/BrutalistCard.astro
Let me check the existing brutalist components:

Using list_dir: directory=src/components/ui
Search files with pattern 'src/components/ui/Brutalist*.astro'
Read fileDESIGN_SYSTEM.md
Now let me check the current design system to understand the brutalist UI components:

Read filesrc/pages/try-demo.astro
Read filesrc/pages/demo/chat.astro
Read filesrc/pages/demo/bias-detection.astro
Now let me look at specific demo pages to understand the current structure:

Search for 'demo' in files in 'src/pages'
Search files with pattern 'src/pages/demo/*.astro'
Now let me search for demo pages specifically:

Search files with pattern '**/*.astro'
Using list_dir: directory=src
Let me check if there's a pages directory:

Search files with pattern 'src/pages/**/*.astro'
Search files with pattern 'src/pages/*.astro'
Using list_dir: directory=src
Using list_dir: directory=.
I'll help you analyze the current state of your project and gather the necessary information to understand what needs to
be updated with the new brutalist design. Let me start by exploring the project structure.
