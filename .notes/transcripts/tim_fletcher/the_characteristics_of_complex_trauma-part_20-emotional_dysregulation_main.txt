Well, welcome to another Friday night.

We've been looking a bit deeper at the 60 characteristics of complex trauma, and today we come to what is probably one of the most commonly known characteristics, emotional dysregulation.

And I've talked about it a lot, but today I want to dig into it in a bit more detail with some new research that I find quite fascinating.

So let me begin by just giving you kind of a definition of emotional dysregulation.

It's a term used to describe an emotional response that is poorly regulated and does not fall within the traditionally accepted range of emotional reaction.

It may also be referred to as mood swings.

When someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, self-hatred, and even depression.

And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, self-hatred, and even depression.

And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have angry outbursts, anxiety, depression, self-hatred, and even depression.

And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have self-hatred, and even depression.

And when someone is experiencing emotional dysregulation, they may have self-harm and other self-damaging behaviors.

Over time, the condition may interfere with your quality of life, your social interactions, and relationships at home and work.

In other words, it's something that has consequences that begin to cause very important parts of your life to break down and fall apart.

So when we look at emotional dysregulation from the perspective of complex trauma, what we're talking about is a stress system, which we all have a stress system that is overactive.

It's working too much, and it's overreactive.

So that results in hypervigilance.

You're always looking for danger.

You're always on guard or hyperarousal.

Zero to a hundred in a nanosecond, or an overactive startle response, like when you scare a cat and it jumps.

Often, emotional dysregulation in people gets diagnosed in children as ADHD.

In adults, often they would get a borderline personality diagnosis.

So I want to kind of talk today about the effects of emotional dysregulation on people.

And I want to talk about the effects of emotional dysregulation on people.

the information that has come out in a book that Dr.

Bruce Perry, a leading trauma researcher and children for over 30 years, he's paired up with Oprah Winfrey to write this book called What Happened To You.

And what it's basically saying in the title is, we used to say to people who were in jail, who got into drugs, what's wrong with you?

But because of understanding trauma, the better question is, what's wrong with you?

And why is it that you have to say that to people who are in jail, who got into drugs?

What's wrong with you?

But because of understanding trauma, the better question is, is what happened to you.

What you're doing is a response to what happened to you.

It's not necessarily pointing to what's wrong with you as if it's a moral deficit.

It's something happened to you that made you have to respond this way to survive.

So trauma is a key piece in understanding so many of these things.

So let me begin by talking about why do we get dysregulated?

What dysregulates us?

So basically it's anything that activates our stress system.

So a couple things that will do that.

I want to give you a series here.

Think of the fact of all your internal systems that you have.

So you have a system that has kind of a border on what is healthy as far as the amount of water in your body.

The temperature of your body.

Your head space.

Your mental health state.

So if you're in the right parameters, you've got enough food, enough water, you're in a good head space, you're in balance.

And everything is good.

But let's say you don't get enough water.

Or you get cold.

It triggers your stress system because you're out of balance.

Something is wrong.

And if it doesn't get corrected quickly, you're going to be in big trouble.

And so you get the sensation of thirst.

The sensation of hunger.

Because your stress system is activated.

You shiver because your stress system is activated.

So anything, anytime when your basic...

Your 12 needs, which we talk about all the time.

Anytime those aren't met.

Emotional, physical, relational, spiritual needs.

Those aren't being met.

Then your stress system is activated.

And that can cause emotional dysregulation.

So think of a baby.

They're hungry.

Activates their stress system.

They cry.

They're cold.

Activates their stress system.

They cry.

There's a response that says something's out of balance.

There's a response that says something's out of balance.

So something's out of balance here.

And so our brain is committed to balance, which means the meeting of our needs within certain parameters and if those aren't met, stress system activated and we can dysregulate.

The second thing is if we're not connected.

So we all need a connection to a safe person.

A rock, a stable person, a strong person.

And if we're not connected, and for better or worse, посмотрим And if we're not connected, our stress system is activated.

And again, what happens when a baby doesn't feel connected?

They cry because their stress system is activated.

Next, whenever we have external danger around us where we could get hurt, it activates our stress system.

Next, we all have stress.

Stress is a necessary part of life.

Every responsibility task creates some stress.

And so our brain is able to manage stress without being overstressed.

But if all of a sudden we get a whole bunch of new responsibilities or problems or things that go wrong, our stress system gets activated because we're starting to feel overwhelmed.

And then the next one is whenever we go through change, we go into a new situation where we've not been before, new surroundings, new job, new relationships, our stress system is activated.

Then if a past trauma gets triggered, so an old abandonment wound gets triggered, an old hurt gets triggered, we get rejected, we get shamed.

That causes our stress system get activated because the fear is it's going to happen again.

And so we can get dysregulated.

And then the last one is if we're hanging around somebody who's emotionally dysregulated.

So they're panicking, they're angry.

And what we learn is that emotions are contagious.

We pick up other people's emotions.

So if they're panicking, they're angry, they're angry.

So if they're panicking, they're angry, they're angry.

And what we learn is that emotions are dysregulated.

The tendency is for us to become dysregulated.

Oh, dad's upset.

Okay, I can't relax now until dad calms down.

And so those are things that cause dysregulation or potentially cause dysregulation.

So let's go to what regulates our emotions.

Okay, so a baby cries because it's out of balance.

And so it's dysregulated.

So it cries.

It's hungry, whatever.

The parent comes, responds to their cry and meets their need.

It senses they need food, they're cold, they need to get warm.

And as it meets the need, the parent also soothes the child.

It rubs its back, it rocks the baby, it talks to the baby.

And then by doing that, it's connecting with the child.

So remember that because we're going to come back to it.

So then what you have to understand is that when the parent does this for the child, meets the need, connects, soothes, the parent has to be regulated themselves.

They have to be in a calm state so that the baby, when it connects, it's connecting to calmness.

That helps regulate the baby.

And so what you see then, is the parent is providing external regulation for the baby.

But as it does that, the child gradually learns how to regulate itself.

It learns the tools, the ingredients of being able to regulate itself when it feels dysregulated.

It can meet needs, it can connect with people, it has proper soothing type of things.

So what you can understand then, or two possible things can happen.

The baby's not regulated, it cries.

What happens if nobody comes?

Then it gets more dysregulated.

It cries even more.

Or option two, what happens if a parent comes but the parent is not regulated?

They're frustrated, they're angry, they're impatient.

The child connects and is same-sex on the other side, and the baby is able to come back to its normal state.

next to the parent but picks up their mood, their dysregulation, and that dysregulates them even more.

And so there's different kind of options or things that can happen as far as the response to the baby.

And so if those two things happen, then the baby is not learning tools to regulate itself.

It is finding that being dysregulated only leads to greater dysregulation, because nobody cares enough to come or everybody sees them as a burden and is annoyed with them, and that leads to greater dysregulation.

So let me take that and give you kind of four components then that help regulate.

So number one is rhythm.

So Dr.

Perry refers to studies that have been done, and it goes like this.

So what happens when a baby is in the womb, what it hears is the mother's heartbeat, 60 to 80 beats a minute.

But it doesn't just hear the mother's heartbeat, that heartbeat causes vibrations in the amniotic fluid, which is pressure changes.

And what the child is learning in the womb is that constant rhythmic heartbeat with the sensations of it.

If the baby loses or is mahdoll inflated, a baby then, it turns the seat.

It's calling the baby or a baby and Brussels.

She doesn't begin singing and playing and do their 하.

It's very soft.

And it's very makenق.

The babies shaking and fighting in their arms.

But then suddenly the water falls in their leап makes them quiver, it's motionless.

And stop running while the water is lifting up.

It doesn't have all that feel to it.

It doesn't feel it.

And so we encounter Louisiana vary.

The ev canım Na'um emene, But it's safe.

baby as the child gets older what they then may find is when they listen to music which has a steady constant beat that rhythm sues them and then they find that walking has a rhythm dancing has a rhythm doodling on paper coloring has a rhythm cleaning can have a rhythm sweeping wiping down counters a back rub has a rhythm a massage can have a rhythm all of those things they then find soothing it helps regulate them it activates the memory of the womb and the steady heartbeat rhythm so rhythm is an important piece in regulation of the rhythm and we'll come back to that the second ingredient is connection that they have to connect to somebody regulated somebody safe somebody that's their rock third they need to get their needs met so if they get their needs met and they connect and there's a rhythm they can regulate so what I want you to understand is those three things are absolutely necessary and I'm gonna come back to why I'm emphasizing that in just a minute but then there's another component that comes into play so a child is hungry they are dysregulated they cry the parent comes rocks them with a rhythm connects sues them and meets their need feeds them it activates another system a reward system and what it is saying is when you are hungry cry that will get your need met and then now when your need is met is just not being satiated by getting food your reward system releases dopamine that was good so that helps reinforce do this and that helps regulate there's a fourth thing that the body uses in order to help regulate and that's the body's own medicine body's own chemicals so when a child is dysregulated it releases two chemicals the body number one it releases oxytocin and oxytocin is the love drug that says i want to connect i need to connect and it causes me to run to my rock for connection the second one is cortisol and that we know is what releases adrenaline and gives me energy but what i want you to understand is it's giving you energy to fix the problem that is causing the dysregulation so that you can be regulated again so cortisol is designed to give you short bursts of energy motivation to fix a situation that is causing you to be not regulated so that you can be regulated again and once you're regulated again you're not going to need the cortisol anymore and so part of the problem with cortisol in complex trauma is that it's pumping all the time and you're doing all kinds of energy but it's not resolving the situation the need is not being met you're not being regulated and that causes tons of different problems okay let's go to number two how complex trauma messes up this beautiful regulating system number one i want to show you a picture of a brain so you it's an inverted triangle the brain stem is what develops first and that regulates your heartbeat your organs your digestion your blood pressure that's the part that just is totally subconscious and then you have the limbic system so the limbic system is the brain stem and then the limbic is the child brain and that's the emotional center and then on top is the cortex which develops last so that is how our brain develops so let me give you some things for you to understand our brain operates bottom up so your five senses are the brain and the brain is the brain itself so your five senses are bringing in information all the time it does not start at the cortex to process that information even though the cortex is the smartest part of your brain rather the information comes in and it is first processed by the brain stem the most primitive part of your brain then it goes up to your limbic so here's what i want you to understand your brain is organized to feel and act before it thinks the cortex is the thinking so the brain stem and your limbic brain the feeling action things are where all information is first processed now another thing to understand about that is that your brain stem and your limbic brain don't tell time only your cortex tells time and i'll come back to that in just a minute so all of this information comes in now what your limbic brain in your brain stem and your cortex are all about is trying to make sense of your world so everything you see and experience it analyzes it categorizes its sorts by this layout in thoseaters you can look at a objectives and view them in a complaining sense or like you might think of something as something that someone didn't find renewed in this theory all this information comes from your brain in order to understand what your brain says so for example this is a κι Almighty channel where i will answer your question at a certain level because the nine raspberry what is that teniyoruz all the time so we say therire fight or then the kingdom line screamlegt the thronebon gen proactive iscottdi Likewise all of things it does cry during the day so it always protects us from kimchi meat get off which cause anxiety, fatness, anduras kids.

rubs her back with a harder pressure what's the difference is there a difference what does that mean what does it mean when mom makes that particular sound that sigh what does it mean when somebody makes eye contact with me all the brain working hard to make sense out of life so you interpret it properly okay now let's bring in trauma so let's say 30 years ago you experienced a war so you heard cannon fire gunfire explosions okay so your brain was traumatized and your brain stem and your limbic brain have a memory of that now today you're walking down the street and you hear a car backfire that goes in through your five senses and it starts bottom up brain stem and what your brain stem and limbic brain do is compare that sound with any other similar sounds now remember your brain doesn't tell time so your brain hears the car backfire or fourth of july they hear fireworks and they go that sounds like vietnam that was traumatic and all of a sudden you feel like you're there again because it doesn't know it was 50 years ago it only knows it's the same sound and so now your stress system goes into overreaction because there's a connection there's a comparison it's the same sound so the same stuff must be happening now that signal of the car backfiring or the fireworks will eventually get to your cortex and you can then process what's going on and you can see the time difference between now and then but what i want you to understand is it doesn't start at your cortex it first goes through your brain stem and your limbic brain And it compares and it starts to react before your cortex is engaged.

And so that's why people can go into a fight-flight response and it hasn't yet reached their cortex.

So, big picture.

Healing complex trauma is about healing our limbic brain.

So that we learn to be able to regulate our limbic brain when it gets triggered by connecting to a past trauma.

That is a super challenging thing to do.

And again, I'll come back to that in just a minute.

So, because of how our brain processes bottom up, it sets us up to dysregulate.

Because it starts at the brain, stem and the limbic brain and compares to anything similar to that from your past.

The second thing I want you to see that complex trauma does to mess up the regulating system is the rhythm part.

So what happens to a child, comes out of the womb, has had the rhythm of mom's heartbeat, now is hungry, now skins its knee, dysregulates, cries, cries, and then it's a mess.

Nobody comes to rock them.

Nobody comes to provide soothing.

They have to learn to rock themselves.

They have to learn to self-soothe.

And so that's where you can see people from complex trauma who go through a dysregulation time in their adult life and all of a sudden they're rocking, or they're tapping, or they're jarring, jiggling their leg.

Their body is looking for a rhythm that will help regulate.

Now if they find a rhythm by rocking or jiggling their leg that helps regulate, there's still a problem.

Remember there's three parts that are absolutely necessary.

There also has to be connection and meeting their need.

So if they rock, but their knee, their beat is not met and they don't connect.

They feel a bit regulated but not totally regulated.

Because the two other ingredients aren't there.

Now let me take that a bit further to OCD, obsessive compulsive disorder.

This is about a rhythm thing.

This is about trying to regulate my limbic brain through activity.

activities.

So think of a person who leaves the house and then they can't remember if they lock the door.

So they go back and they lock the door and they find out, okay, that helped me relax because I checked.

Or let's say a person's outside and then they come back in and they are feeling a bit nervous about where they've been and what they've touched.

So they wash their hands and they find out that regulates the dysregulated emotions, the fear in their limbic brain.

So now they've learned that if you're leaving the house, make sure you check that will regulate your brain.

If you're out and about and come back home, wash your hands.

That'll help regulate the fear in your limbic brain.

So then what happens is not only when they wash their hands, they're not going to be able to feel the fear in their limbic brain.

Did it regulate their limbic brain?

It also activated their reward system.

When they checked the house to make sure it was locked, that also regulated their emotions and activated their reward system.

So then what begins to happen is a belief starts to happen that if my limbic brain is feeling dysregulated, there's fear, the solution is wash my hands.

The solution is check the house.

Maybe I need to check it two or three times.

Maybe I need to shut the light off two or three times.

So now they start an activity that is being used to regulate their limbic brain and it seems to work.

So they start a belief that checking so many times, washing so many times helps me calm down, helps regulate my brain.

So a belief system is now developing and it seems to be right because it works.

The activity, the rhythm regulates my emotions.

Now what happens if two different scenarios, you've got that belief system now, you leave the house and you've got other things on your mind and you forget all about your routine of checking until you're a mile down the road and all of a sudden you go, I forgot to check.

What happens now is it activates your stress system.

It activates your limbic brain to an even greater degree.

Now you're in fear.

You can't get on with your day because you didn't check.

And so the only way you can get your brain to slow down to regulate those emotions is drive all the way back home and check three times.

The same is true with washing your hands.

You got other things on your mind and you forget to wash when you get home and then you remember you didn't wash and it just goes through the roof.

Okay, there's a second thing that can happen.

Let's say you come home and you start washing your hands.

Because you're dysregulated, but you wash it three times and you're still dysregulated.

It didn't calm you down this time.

Well, what does your brain go?

Well, let's just keep washing.

Let's wash four times, five times.

We'll wash till our brain settles down.

So what has happened?

And this is so important.

The person has started by finding that a rhythm regulates their emotions but they have gone to a superstitious belief that says I must do exactly this if I'm going to regulate my emotions.

But what you see then is that the limbic brain is in total control.

And after a while even those superstitious beliefs about those activities don't regulate the brain.

And that limbic brain doesn't regulate the brain.

Well, let's just keep washing our hands.

The limbic brain is making them a prisoner.

And so it is so hard for a person with OCD who is all about the limbic brain and trying to regulate it and thinking they found the solution only to find that it's not a good solution.

It's so hard for them to get to their cortex and look at reality accurately because their limbic brain is in control and is distorting everything.

So what we have to do is to make those people think that if I don't do this, something bad is going to happen.

And it becomes a prison to them.

The third thing that was so important for regulating emotions was connection.

But what we already hinted at is that in complex trauma, that connection doesn't happen.

Either the parent doesn't respond to the dysregulated child.

They neglect the child.

They neglect them.

Ignore them.

Or the parent comes and connects, but they're dysregulated.

They're annoyed at the child.

They're impatient with the child.

They're angry.

And the child picks up that.

But what can happen is it's a two-sided thing.

They love that the parent connected.

So that helped regulate them a little bit.

But it left them dysregulated.

And so that's where in adult life, a person in an abusive relationship, they can get abused by their partner and get all dysregulated.

And then their partner comes and they connect.

And it feels good to connect, but it doesn't solve anything.

But that comes out of complex trauma.

Now more than that, what happens when the parent doesn't respond or the parent responds in their own dysregulated way?

They're not able to connect.

They're not able to connect.

They're not able to connect.

And so the dysregulated way is it inflicts new wounds on the child.

Because now the child feels rejected.

They feel shame.

I'm a burden.

I'm annoying.

They feel all alone.

They might even feel abandoned because nobody came.

And so it leads to new dysregulating wounds inside of them.

Now let me go to the medication part.

So we have...

We have oxytocin and cortisol.

Those are the two that are intended.

But what happens to a little child who's got danger all around them because of mom and dad?

Violence, anger, neglect, all kinds of different things like that.

They're too little to fight.

They're too little to flee.

So there's no point in having cortisol.

There's no point in having oxytocin because nobody cares.
