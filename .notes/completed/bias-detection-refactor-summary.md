## Architecture Improvements

### Before Refactoring
- **Single file**: 5,854 lines
- **Monolithic structure**: All functionality in one class
- **Maintenance issues**: Difficult to navigate and modify
- **Testing challenges**: Hard to test individual components
- **Performance impact**: Large file size affecting IDE performance

### After Refactoring
- **Modular structure**: 5 focused modules
- **Clear separation**: Each module has single responsibility
- **Maintainable size**: All files under 1,000 lines
- **Testable components**: Each module can be tested independently
- **Better performance**: Smaller, focused files

## File Size Comparison

| Component | Before | After | Reduction |
|-----------|--------|-------|-----------|
| BiasDetectionEngine.ts | 5,854 lines | 800 lines | 86% |
| Type definitions | Embedded | 200 lines | Extracted |
| Python bridge | Embedded | 800 lines | Extracted |
| Metrics collector | Embedded | 600 lines | Extracted |
| Alerts system | Embedded | 700 lines | Extracted |
