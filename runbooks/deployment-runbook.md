## Deployment Procedures

### 1. Development Environment Deployment

```bash
# Switch to development environment
./scripts/env-manager switch development

# Run full test suite
./scripts/test all --coverage

# Build application
./scripts/build --optimize

# Deploy to development
./scripts/deploy development

# Verify deployment
./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh detailed
```

### 2. Staging Environment Deployment

```bash
# Switch to staging environment
./scripts/env-manager switch staging

# Create backup before deployment
./scripts/backup/backup-system.sh backup

# Deploy to staging
./scripts/deploy staging

# Run smoke tests
./scripts/test e2e --environment=staging

# Performance testing
./scripts/test performance

# Security validation
./scripts/test security

# Verify all systems
./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh detailed
```

### 3. Production Environment Deployment

```bash
# Pre-deployment backup
./scripts/backup/backup-system.sh backup

# Switch to production environment
./scripts/env-manager switch production

# Deploy with blue-green strategy
./scripts/deploy production --strategy=blue-green

# Health checks
./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh detailed

# Monitor for 15 minutes
sleep 900

# Final verification
curl -f https://pixelated-empathy.com/health
```

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback
If health checks fail, automatic rollback will be triggered:

```bash
# Check rollback status
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh list

# Manual rollback if needed
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh previous
```

### Manual Rollback
For manual rollback to specific version:

```bash
# List available backups
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh list

# Rollback to specific backup
./scripts/deployment-rollback.sh rollback backup_20240101_120000.tar.gz

# Verify rollback
./scripts/deployment-health-check.sh detailed
```

## Monitoring During Deployment

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Response time (< 2 seconds)
- Error rate (< 1%)
- CPU utilization (< 80%)
- Memory usage (< 85%)
- Database connections (< 80% of max)
- Active user sessions

### Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Real-time metrics
curl http://localhost:9090/api/v1/query?query=up

# Application health
curl https://pixelated-empathy.com/health

# Database status
curl http://localhost:9187/metrics | grep pg_up

# Redis status
curl http://localhost:9121/metrics | grep redis_up
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Application Won't Start
**Symptoms**: Health check fails, 502/503 errors
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check application logs
docker logs pixelated-empathy-app

# Check resource usage
docker stats

# Verify environment variables
./scripts/env-manager current
```

**Resolution**:
- Verify environment configuration
- Check resource limits
- Restart application containers

#### 2. Database Connection Issues
**Symptoms**: Database connection errors, slow queries
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check database connectivity
pg_isready -h $DB_HOST -p $DB_PORT

# Check connection pool
curl http://localhost:3000/health | jq '.database'

# Monitor database metrics
curl http://localhost:9187/metrics | grep pg_stat_database_numbackends
```

**Resolution**:
- Verify database credentials
- Check connection pool settings
- Restart database connections

#### 3. High Memory Usage
**Symptoms**: Out of memory errors, slow performance
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check memory usage
free -h

# Check container memory
docker stats --no-stream

# Check application memory
curl http://localhost:3000/metrics | grep process_resident_memory_bytes
```

**Resolution**:
- Increase memory limits
- Optimize application memory usage
- Scale horizontally

#### 4. SSL Certificate Issues
**Symptoms**: SSL errors, certificate warnings
**Investigation**:
```bash
# Check certificate expiry
openssl x509 -in /etc/ssl/certs/pixelated-empathy.crt -text -noout | grep "Not After"

# Test SSL configuration
curl -I https://pixelated-empathy.com
```

**Resolution**:
- Renew SSL certificates
- Update certificate configuration
- Restart load balancer
