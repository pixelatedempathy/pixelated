what we do.

It's a bunch of messed up people that like to get together and learn about how messed up they are, not to feel sorry for themselves, but so that they can start to learn tools for becoming healthy.

And so we have people here from addiction, people here from childhood trauma, people here from just messed up relationships looking for help and for answers.

So we tend to do little series that focus on themes that follow this way of thinking.

We teach that addiction and a lot of the relationship issues aren't the real problems, they're symptoms of deeper problems.

So we like to understand what are the deeper problems that have resulted in me developing ways of coping with those problems that aren't healthy and are messing up my life today.

So the series that we're on now is called The Real Problems of Addiction.

And it's a series that we're on now that we're learning about where we're going to go from here.

And then it's the 3rd one that we're going to be talking about now is, this is our 3rd one is shame.

Shame is a word that's not understood well.

But I would say from my experience as a counselor in the field of trauma and addiction, shame is one of the biggest issues that people have to deal with.

And if they don't understand it, it can really mess them up, but to understand it is very painful.

So shame, just to summarize very briefly, is a core belief that a child develops when they're neglected or abused or abandoned or their needs aren't consistently met, where they think the reason those things are happening to me is because I'm not good enough.

Something is wrong with me.

And that core belief takes hold deep inside of them.

And without them realizing it, it begins to shape how they approach relationships.

It begins to shape how they think about themselves, how they treat themselves, how they cope in life.

And so they do things that make them feel better in the moment and let them survive in the moment.

But it messes up all the other things long term.

And so we've been trying to understand what shame is and how it affects us.

And I want to develop it a little bit further tonight.

What we are.

We began to look at last week was this.

Nobody likes to live with the core belief that something's wrong with me and I'm not valuable or lovable.

So at a subconscious level, the brain begins to look for a solution to that problem.

And it's going to be looking for ways to feel better about themselves, ways to get others to like them and respect them, because their belief, core belief is if people get to know the real me, they will abuse me, neglect me, abandon me like my parents did.

So I can't let people see the real me, but I still need people to like me and respect me.

So it begins to develop all kinds of competing priorities, which results in ways of trying to get those needs met.

Last week, we looked at how it affects our ability to connect in a healthy way to other people and how it creates a relationship with others.

And we're going to talk about that in a little bit.

So let's get started.

Let's get started.

So let's get started.

So let's get started.

So let's get started.

So let's get started.

So let's get started.

So let's get started.

Tonight, I want to get give you seven more things that happen as a result of shame in your life that you may not have realized, but I hope will help you realize how big of an issue it is and will help you begin to learn ways of coping that are healthy ways of healing.

So the first thing I want to talk about is one of the things the brain proposes as a solution to the problem of people's mental health.

So it's going to be looking for a solution to that problem.

to shame so shame walks around thinking I have no value from my internal self it inherently I have no value and that's why I'm not lovable that's why people don't respect me that's why people abandon me and abuse me okay so how do I find value I can't find it internally so I need to find my value in externals so I'm gonna give you a list of things that the brain devises as ways to find values so number one the brain says let's compare ourselves to others so let's take my greatest strength and I'll compare myself to everybody else so let's say you're a girl or a guy that is just particularly blessed with good looks and a really nice body so you are the hottest in your school and now you compare yourself to every girl in the school and you walk away saying I'm better than everybody because I'm hotter than everybody therefore I'm superior I've solved my shame so your value now is based on your body other people they don't have a body but they're smart and we now live in a culture where nerds are actually being respected as being wow I wish I was one of them they can make a lot of money so you go I'm smarter than everybody here like Sheldon on Big Bang and therefore I'm superior to everybody because I can outthink everybody so some go that route some go I'm not smart or good looking but I am good at football and so I'm better at sports than anybody else so I'll compare myself in that area either say I have more money and more things I have better tech toys than other people I've got a bigger house I've got a better job a greater position and we compare ourselves all the time now that seems to work until a prettier girl comes to your school and then all of a sudden you're insecure and all of a sudden there's a competition on and there's a cat fight happening and you got to prove you're smart you're prettier than her and you're better than her so that is the challenge is that this solution doesn't really work long term then the pretty person with the great body they hit a midlife crisis around 40 because gravity starts to have an effect then they need extra work done to become a cougar and so they can at 40 still attract the 25 year old hunk and they can walk around say I still got it and then at 50 they have another crisis and then they got to become a puma and you know how it goes you didn't know no I knew those street terms did you okay so that's the challenge when you try to get your value from the external there's always a danger that somebody with better will come along now some people they can't compete in those worlds so they say I will find a Christian world where there's lots of rules and I can be a better Christian than everybody and then I can walk around with my nose in the air saying God loves me better than you because I'm a better Christian and some of you have met people like that and they're not a lot of fun to be around are there say you know what I can't compete in any of those..?

of those arenas but I can be a bad boy and I can be the baddest of the bad boys so that will become my identity that will be what gets me respect that's where I'm going to gain my sense of value so if you think about it you can compete in any arena so let me just give you this in case you've never thought about it how many of you when you were doing lines thought at least they don't inject so I'm a better addict than you you have haven't you so even in addiction you develop ways of comparing so that you come out on top compared to other people so we have this built into us but it sets it up that I always have to prove I'm better than you and it always leads to insecurity so what I say to people is this if your value comes from inside you have nothing to prove and if you have nothing to prove you don't have to worry about losing your position or your value so nothing to prove equals nothing to lose and so that becomes an important thing for people let me give you another thing outside of comparison think of the first thing in your life as a child that you can remember where you were validated by other people where they laughed at you or they cheered you or they say wow about you some of you might have heard the first compliment you got was you are such a pretty girl others you might got you are so funny and guess what happens once that gets into your brain you go there's a lot of that's what is my greatest source of value so I got to be funny all the time now so often the very first thing you get validated for becomes the greatest thing that you place your value in and therefore one of the hardest things to change next one for many people is they gain their sense of value or dealing with their shame by always helping people who are messed up so if i help you that proves i'm healthier than you that proves that i'm better than you so you will get a lot of people in the helping industry for the wrong reasons and they're just trying to prove their value and fix their own internal shame thing another one is you become your career you become what you do you're not a human being you're a human doer so what happens for people that retire many of them fall apart because now they don't know who they are and they feel they have no value because their job is what gave them their sense of value and that is a very big one another one though that is even more common is many get their value from being a parent so what happens when a little baby comes into your world they are totally dependent on you they need you that gives you a sense of value then they respect you they put you on a pedestal you're superman in their mind you can do no wrong they love you they adore you they want to spend time with you and that gives you all the validation the love all the stuff that you think is solving your shame but that child is growing up and as they grow up they need you less and less and that creates a crisis within you because if i can't be a mom or a dad and my kids don't need me anymore then where does my value come from so what some parents sadly do is they try to keep their children dependent on them they try to keep their children needing them not because it's good for the child but because it keeps them feeling they have value and when their children finally leave home they have a empty nest crisis now what good am i who am I all of those things another one and you've probably met many people like this or you're one of them but you pursue validation I don't know if you've ever met somebody that they're kind of spotlight seekers so if somebody else in a group of people starts talking and the spotlight goes off of them all of a sudden they're over here oh but i got a story i got a story and they got the spotlight back on them they're spotlight seekers or you tell a story but you know what their stories are way better than your story it's always a one-up story or they went fishing and they caught a 12 inch fish but they tell you it's three feet and you don't know the truth anymore about their stories because they're always sensationalized why to impress you and if they impress you you will respect them more and what does respect mean you will give value to them and that they think will heal their shame or you get something that's not so good or something that's not so good but you know what they're talking about and that's what they're talking about and they're talking about and they're talking about and some people that every time they meet you, they got to tell you their latest accomplishment, looking for a pat on the back.

And it gets to after a while where you just want to avoid them when you see them coming, because you don't want to hear their latest bragging about what they've accomplished.

So all of those things are ways the brain is trying to solve shame.

So what I want you to understand is they seem to work initially, but over time they start giving negative consequences.

They don't satisfy, they don't fix the shame problem, because you're trying to solve it through respect from others, but you don't respect yourself.

And that is where it breaks down.

Okay, let me give you something about this.

Where does my value come from?

So it's...

There's one thing to say, I have shame and I feel I have no value.

The question is, is that true?

Do I have any value inherently, or does my value come only from my externals?

So there's four things, four types of value, four types of respect, okay?

Number one is inherent value.

Born into every human being is a sense of value.

So do you realize that babies are a total drain on our economy and our energy, and they take, take, take, take?

And we love them to death and value them.

Why?

They can't do a job.

They can't make money.

They don't help pay the bills.

They just create more bills.

They don't give you greater peace of mind.

They give you more anxiety.

They don't give you greater sleep.

They give you less sleep.

But why do we value a baby?

Because something is born in us that comes with the package of an infant that we say that child has value.

Even though they can do nothing, they still have value.

So we all have that.

And so what that means is, that's why we treat every person with respect.

They might be a total jerk, but they're still a human.

And so they have...

They do not and require a certain amount of respect.

There's an equality in all of us called humanity.

And that deserves respect.

If you think too of a person with severe Alzheimer's, they are a drain on our economy.

They're a drain on your energy and time and resources.

But we don't go and put them to death because we say they still have value.

And so that is the challenge that we have.

have.

So inherent value, you don't earn it.

It's there.

It comes with the package.

Second one is value that is due to good character.

So if you're with somebody who's honest and reliable, somebody who's there for you to support you and walk by you through tough, tough times, you go, you have earned my respect because of your character.

So that is the second type of respect.

Third type are people who make many sacrifices to help others.

And you watch what they give.

You watch the time and energy they put into people and serve people.

And you say, you have earned my respect.

So you can have a baby and give them respect, but then you can have somebody with great character and great servant heart.

And you go, wow, I look up to you.

You've earned that.

Okay.

Then there's a fourth type.

And that's the badge.

That's the position of authority.

So you could have a policeman who doesn't have any character.

He's corrupt.

He doesn't do anything good.

He's puts all the wrong people arrested, but you still respect them because he's wearing a badge.

And you go, if I don't respect the badge, I don't respect the person wearing the badge, but I got to respect the badge.

Okay.

Now let me take that and apply it to the person who's wearing the badge.

One of the most common things used in recovery by parents.

You got to do what I want because you're supposed to respect your parents.

What does that mean?

Is that respect one, two, three, or four?

Do you realize that all you owe your parents is number one and four.

If they haven't earned your respect out of character or the right kind of behaviors, they don't deserve that.

Kind of respect.

You're not required to give it to them, but you still want to give them the respect you would give any stranger that's inherent in all of us.

And you want to give them the respect of the badge of their position as parents.

But it sure doesn't mean that you don't have to have boundaries with them.

It sure doesn't mean you don't have to call them on their stuff.

It sure doesn't mean you have to say, you're out of my life for now.

You can still say that and have number one and four respect.

And that is an important piece to sort out in this whole respect thing.

So the part I want you to walk away from is this.

Shame is I don't respect myself.

Now I have to say, do I have value?

Yes, I have number one.

I have inherent value because I'm a human being.

So I need to respect myself at a bare minimum for number one.

Number two.

I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself.

I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself.

I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself.

I don't have to have a lot of respect for myself.

Number two and three, the more I have good character and the more I am a giving person and a loving person, I will actually grow in respect for myself.

But the first step of healing shame is I respect myself based on number one.

I have inherent value.

I don't have to do anything.

I can be a total jerk, but I still have some value.

Let's start there and then we can work on it.

I work on two and three as part of our recovery and our respect will grow.

Okay, let me just give you one thing more to think about.

Take respect.

If you were to go to a street level, respect is a huge word.

Loyalty is part of that.

And so what does respect and honor mean on a street level?

It is something that you respect me based on fear.

You don't.

Rat me out.

You don't hold me accountable for the bad things I do.

You affirm me for the good things and you support me for the bad.

You never stand up to me.

That's respect.

You see how it just took respect and twisted it.

So what you'll find is shame takes every good quality and it distorts it and it makes it something with the same worth.

You can't just say that.

It's not a word, but a totally different definition and something unhealthy.

And that you can think about.

We don't have time to develop.

Okay, next thing I want you to think about how does shame affect conflict in a relationship?

It does a lot.

What happened for you if you grew up in complex trauma is there was conflict, but you notice that when there was conflict, there was a winner and there was a loser.

Conflict didn't resolve stuff and reach solutions where everybody benefited and there wasn't a winner or loser.

Somebody won and somebody lost and pity the person who lost because if they lost, they didn't just get loser.

They got shamed.

They got punished.

They got made fun of.

So what happens is I never want to lose a conflict.

So what do people with shame do?

They either.

I'm not.

I'm not going to lose a conflict.

I'm going to avoid conflict at all costs because I got so much shame.

I'm pretty sure I'm going to lose and I'm not just going to lose.

My shame is going to get fed.

So avoid conflict at all costs or if a conflict starts and it starts to look like I might be the loser.

Get out of it.

Find some way to change the subject.

Some way to deflect the conversation.

To something else.

But don't let it continue because you're going to lose or number three.

Become a pro at twisting everything.

So it's always the other person's fault.

That's shame response.

So do you realize that a narcissist is never wrong in their mind?

And a narcissist will twist every conflict to make you wrong and it's never their fault.

That is deep, deep shame.

Hiding behind twisting reality.

And then the fourth one is I will never lose because if you're angry, I will always be angrier than you.

And I will trump your anger and you will always lose.

So shame.

What I want you to see is if you both people of shame, conflict will never get resolved in a healthy way.

It will always get avoided somehow.

And it will always be.

It will always be.

But if it's avoided somehow, somebody will always get hurt and issues will just pile up.

Not resolved.

So it does over time a tremendous amount of damage.

Next, how does shame affect your ability to set boundaries?

What does it feel like if you say no to somebody and you got lots of shame?

You panic and go, I bet you they're not going to like me now.

They're going to be mad.

Because I just said no to them.

And I just lost a friend.

So what does a deeply shamed person believe?

I can never say no to anybody because then they won't like me.

So I will say yes to everybody.

I will become a people pleaser.

And I will let people use me and take advantage of me because I never want anybody mad at me.

And how does that work for you?

It doesn't.

Because over time now you get mad at everybody.

But let me take that into today.

What you're trained with with all of that is if you set a boundary, you feel guilty.

You feel like you're being selfish.

You feel like you're doing something wrong.

You're being unloving and unkind.

So shame takes boundary setting and distorts it to be a bad thing.

And why you should never do it.

But if you don't, you'll never get healthy.

You will always be used and abused.

And people will just take advantage of you and wear you out and beat you into the ground.

Some people, if they're not afraid to say no, they'll let people use them and use them and use them.

And then one of two things will happen to try to get them out of the way.

Number one is they'll isolate.

So the only way they can set a boundary is move away from everybody.

That doesn't really work very well in the long run.

The second thing is they explode.

And that drives everybody away.

It's kind of a boundary setting thing.

The problem is once they do that, they feel so guilty, they apologize to everybody and let them take advantage of them again.

So it doesn't work.

And that's why you're not allowed to do it.

And that's why you're not allowed to do it.

And that's why you're not allowed to do it.

So it doesn't work.

So part of healing from shame is getting to the point where you say, I respect myself enough that I'm worth fighting for.

And I'm worth setting boundaries for.

Not to be selfish, but to be healthy.

Because that's what healthy is.

And so that is an important part of the learning process.

Number four.

Another thing that the brain sometimes does to try and know, Number four.

Another thing that the brain sometimes does to try and know, is to see power or feeling a sense of power as a solution to shame.

is to see power or feeling a sense of power as a solution to shame.

So let me give it to you this way.

Let's say you got a great big bodybuilder, muscular man, Let's say you got a great big bodybuilder, muscular man, who's a big fighter and everybody's afraid of him.

He has power.

He walks around and his presence is intimidating.

And everybody is just giving him respect.

And he likes that feeling of power.

He likes that feeling he can just say boo to somebody and they'll run.

That's power and it's addictive.

But it seems to make his shame go away.

But it doesn't.

Some women get this when they flirt with a guy for the first time.

And they realize these guys are weaklings right now.

They're putty in my hand.

I'm powerful over these guys.

They'll do whatever I want.

And they like that power.

They hate the attention they're getting.

But they like the power and it's addictive.

And so part of dealing with shame is stopping some of the power games.

And that is a scary place to go.

Okay, let me show you the next thing.

Okay, let me show you the next thing.

How does shame affect the way I treat myself?

Do you realize that shame causes me to treat myself negatively all the time, especially when I failed?

And most of it I do subconsciously.

So here's some of the things that can happen if you've got lots of shame.

If you're feeling really happy today, you feel guilty you're having such a good time.

That's shame saying you shouldn't be so happy.

Because you're a screw up.
