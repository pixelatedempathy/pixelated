Okay.  I am going to take you then, what does that do to a child?  What emotions does that then create when they are made to feel not valuable, not lovable, not good enough?  Well, you can imagine there's pain.  Lots of it.  There's fear.  Will anybody want me?  Will anybody respect me?  And so they have a lot of anxiety now.  As they make friends, a lot of insecurities are now there.  Many, with shame, become depressed because they do not like themselves.  Life sucks.  They hate themselves.  They are very hard on themselves.  Some begin self-harming behaviors because they hate themselves so much.  They find out there's a lot of anger in there.  They are jealous.  They are jealous of anybody that has more attention than them.  They are envious of what everybody else has.  They get very negative about themselves and everybody else.  And they are very discontent.  And for some, they get to a place where they feel hopeless.  I am a total screw-up.  I do not see any way out of this.  What's the point?  So what I want you to understand is shame does nothing but produce negative emotions and powerful negative emotions.  Not mild ones, but powerful ones.  And so the emotional world of a shame-based person is predominantly negative emotions.  And that is a difficult thing to live with because what happens with shame is you do not know how to fix it.  You find no way to resolve it, so there's no way to resolve the negative emotions.

But let me add one more piece here.  So what happens to a child is if I do something that's below the standard, okay?  So let's say I go to school with a big pimple.  I am going to be made to feel ugly, and that will feed my shame, but it will not stop there.  I am going to get teased.  I am going to get a new nickname.  I am going to get made fun of.  And so shame is not just a package all by itself.  Shame also has other emotions or other things that people do to you that hurt.  So pain does not just end, or shame does not just end with shame.  Shame leads to more pain.  Nothing good comes out of shame.  Okay, I am going to take you a little bit longer here, but I want you to understand how our brain tries to solve shame.  So in the middle is the real self, okay?  Now if you are told through the mirrors that your real self is no good, that you are less than, that you are not lovable, you develop the gray area outside of that, the other circle, which is the shame-based self, and that's the critic.  And the critic is now in your brain that's constantly saying, you are not good enough.  And it puts yourself down, and it's very negative towards yourself.  Okay, so that's there, but there's still a part of you that says, I want to be loved.

I want to be respected.  How do I do that?  So only solution is this.  I cannot show them my real self because they will reject me and abandon me like mom and dad.  I have to.  I have to do the third circle, a persona, and that's the mask that you start to wear.  If I act this way, maybe people will like me.  If I act this way, maybe people will respect me.  So now you have a third person.  You have got the real self, the critic self, and now the personas that you wear.

But then you got a fourth circle that says, if only I was like this.  The ideal self in your mind, that if you were like this, you would be perfectly happy.  Everybody would love you.  Everybody would respect you.  It's a fantasy, but it's in your thinking.  If only I was like this, all my problems would be solved.  Now here's the problem.  You got that critic person?  Guess what it's constantly doing?  It's comparing you to the ideal self, which is an unrealistic standard.  You are never going to attain it.  So it compares what you are doing day by day with this ideal self, and what's the conclusion it's drawing?  You are not good enough.  So what you just have in your brain is a system now that looks like it's solving your shame, but it's actually reinforcing your shame.  You think you are finding a way to feel better, but the critic says, oops, you did not meet the mark.  You failed.  Oops, you did not meet it.  You failed.  You are this terrible less than person.  And so shame starts to feed off itself.  So I want you to think of your parents up at the top, you underneath that, and your parents are being neglectful, critical, abusive, all the things that we just described.  So what is happening is you got the yellow square of the brain, okay?  So as you grow up with your parents, your parents are giving you these messages, and what are you doing?  You are filing them away in your brain.  As you get older, you do not even need your parents to say anything anymore when you do something.  Your brain just says, you loser, and they repeat all the things that your parent said.  So your parents once criticized you, but guess what happened as you grew up?  You took your parents and stuck them into your brain, so we call it an internal parent is now in your brain, and it's a critic.  So regardless of what you do, it will never be good enough to your brain.  So it's another way that shame sets up systems to prevent you from ever escaping shame because now you have your parents living in your head, judging everything you do with a shame message.  Another way to understand that is as you grow up as a child, your parents said you are too sensitive.  So you say, I hate that about myself.  And you say, I wish I could just find a way to cut that out of myself and throw it away.  So you say, I am just going to shut that part of me down and never be sensitive again.  I hate that about myself.  And then a little while longer, you are so angry nobody likes to be around you.  Oh, so now you, I hate my anger.  I wish I could just get rid of my anger.  And you shut that part of yourself down.  Over time, guess what's happening?  You are hating more and more of yourself.  You are wishing you could take those parts, shut them away in a closet, and never have to do it again.  You are going to have to deal with them again.  So you are taking your parents' messages and now you are shaming yourself.  You are keeping it going.  And that's the challenge with shame.  Final thing and then we will end.  What's the difference between shame and guilt?  Very important question.  Guilt is about what you do.  Shame is about who you are.  Guilt is about actions.  Shame is about identity.  Guilt is actually a wonderful system where we have this thing called a conscience that if we do something that violates love, we feel pain.  So if we tell a lie, if we cheat somebody, cheat on somebody, steal, something bugs us.  That's guilt.  It was designed to be a good system that was designed to be a good system to say, are you in enough pain yet to smarten up and change your behaviour?  To get back to telling the truth, to being honest.  So guilt's a wonderful system to correct unloving behaviour and make it loving again.  So guilt is resolvable.  Shame is not resolvable.  It is saying you are not good enough and there's nothing you can do about it.  You just have to live with that identity and all the emotions you feel around that identity.  So shame is the problem area because you cannot find a way to fix it.  Now I have got to add false guilt because in complex trauma families, your conscience was often misguided or miseducated.  So dad was saying, you are selfish for wanting to play baseball and you go, it's wrong to play baseball, bad me.  That's a misguided conscience but now you feel guilt every time you want something.  And so part of recovery is learning true guilt from false guilt.  Okay, final thing.  Once you have a lot of shame and then you do something wrong, you get guilt, right?

But what does guilt do now?  I did something bad, I am bad.  So guilt now feeds shame.  So if you have got lots of shame, I do not feel good enough, I am bad, I am not lovable, you steal from somebody, you feel guilt, but then you go, oh, that just proves how bad I am.  So those feed each other.  I knew going into shame was going to be a little bit of a pick me up because it is such a heavy topic.  So I thought I would tell you some stories from the Bible about screwed up people and how God viewed those people to just help you understand that just because you have shame does not mean God's going to put you on the shelf or that God does not see you as having value.  And that's the fear of a lot of people with shame.  And the fear of a lot of people with shame is that nobody else seems to value me.  Probably God does not value me.  Or yes, God loves me, blah, blah, blah, I get that.

But I do not think God passionately desires me or delights in me.  So I want to start with a story that you have probably read and maybe have thought that you kind of got it.

But I want to give you a bit of the cultural history and you are going to see this story come alive.  It's about when Jesus chose his disciples.  So you remember at the beginning of his ministry at 30 years of age, he picked 12 people to follow him, which became known as the 12 disciples and later the apostles.  So it says, One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Peter and Andrew, throwing a net into the water for they fished for a living.  Jesus called out to them, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people.  And they left their nets at once and followed him.  A little further up the shore, he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, repairing their nets, and he called them to come too.  So typically what we would visualize when we see that is how we would interpret Jesus saying, come follow me.  And we would simply think, okay, we are supposed to follow along behind him and see where he's going today.

But that term was a very technical term.  And when you understand it, you are going to see this begin to become alive.  So at that time in the Jewish culture, everybody went to school, and part of what they had to learn in school was they had to memorize the first five books of the Bible.  So that's Genesis to Deuteronomy.  And if you have ever read that, that would be a project to memorize.  Now if you are a really, really keen student, you would memorize the entire Old Testament, all 39 books.  That's just a massive accomplishment.  As a child was getting to the point of graduation, some things would happen.  First of all, the most respected rabbis, and rabbis were kind of the main religious teachers.  They would come to the schools looking for the brightest, most capable students.  And once they had interviewed students and talked to teachers, they would go up to what they considered to be the most brightest student, and they would say, follow me.  And what that meant was, this is now going to be your life.  From now on, you are going to spend time learning everything I know, and becoming like me in character, so that when I am gone, you can keep it going.  So follow me meant sign up the rest of your life to follow me, to learn and then teach what I am teaching.  It was a life commitment.  Now you can imagine that the top rabbis would not pick all the students.  They only pick the very select, brightest students.  So there's still a whole bunch of other students that were not picked.  So that takes to the second option available, is that the kids graduating, they could go to the other rabbis in their villages and around, and they would go to them and say, could I follow you?  In other words, would you consider taking me on as your disciple to train me so that I can eventually do what you are doing?  So they would go to all the other rabbis, and a number of them would get picked, but still not everybody was picked.  Only the brightest, and then the next brightest who the rabbis liked.  So what was the option for the people that were not picked?  They went back to their father's business and worked for their dad.  Did you notice when I read to you about Peter, Andrew, James, and John, who were they working for?  Their dad.  What does that say about Peter, Andrew, James, and John?  Nobody else wanted them.  They were the rejects.  They were the ones that were not good enough.  Is not it interesting that Jesus did not go to the top students and say, will you follow me?  He went to the ones nobody else wanted.  He picked from the reject pile.  So there's hope for all of us.

But we are not done.  He did not just pick those four fisherman guys.  He picked a guy named Matthew.  Now Matthew was a tax collector.  And if you are in Canada, you do not like kind of Revenue Canada bugging you when you do your income taxes.

But you do not lose a ton of sleep necessarily over a tax collector.

But in that culture, tax collectors were the most hated people in their culture.  Because what happened was, if you got the license to be a tax collector, you had to go to Rome, who was considered the enemy of Israel.  And basically you had to get in bed with Rome and pay Rome and give Rome some of your money and engage in Rome's domination of abusing Israel.  And if they gave you a license, you could set up your little office on the street corner.  So what you could do, let's say, you were going to be able to put a tax on the amount of fish that a person caught.

But here's what tax collectors did.  They were greedy and Rome really did not care how they abused their own people.  So they said, I am going to make a new thing to tax.  I am going to start taxing the number of wheels you have on your cart.  So you got two wheels.  Oh, you got four wheels.  You are going to get taxed even more.  And then they kept making taxes up so that the people of Israel were putting more and more of their profits into paying tax collectors and they were getting poorer and poorer.  And there was nothing they could do about it because Rome was supporting these tax collectors.  So they became the most hated men in Israel, but they were also considered the most dishonest people and the most evil thieves around.  Men with zero character, men who had no regard for human beings, total narcissists, total greedy people.  So they were not allowed to go to church.  They would have security people saying, not allowed.  And they were banned from church and religious activities.  They were considered so untrustworthy and so greedy and corrupt that they were not allowed to testify in court because they could be bought off and give false testimony very easily.  So they were not allowed there.  They were classified as the lowest in society.  In fact, they taught that God would never forgive a tax collector and that he was happy when tax collectors died.  Guess who Jesus picked?  A tax collector.  Somebody that God was not supposed to forgive, but Jesus forgave.  Somebody that God was supposed to get happy when they died, but Jesus wants them on his team.  Okay, next one.  Simon the Zealot.  In that culture, they had these daggers.  And these men, Simon the Zealot, was part of what was known as the group that carried daggers.  It was a gang.  So he was a gang member.  And what these guys did is they are saying, Rome is corrupt.  All of our people who are in politics are corrupt.  We are going to have to take the law in our own hands.  And we are going to have to do kind of vigilante justice here.  So they walked around with a dagger under their robe.  And if they saw a Roman soldier standing there with no other Roman soldiers, into the heart.  If they got a tax collector by himself, they killed him.  Guess who Jesus picked?  A gang member who was a murderer.

But did you notice?  Zealots killed tax collectors.  And Jesus said, Simon, Matthew, you are on the same team now.  Get along.  Two people that hated each other and feared each other.  And then he picked those two, James and John, the fishermen.

But they had a nickname.  When Jesus called them, they were known as the son of thunder.  Now in the language of that day, when you were called the son of something, what that meant, you were totally like it.  It was like that was your dad and you were the splitting image or the spitting image of that thing.  So what does it say?  James and John are the spitting image of thunder.  What do you think that's trying to say about James and John?  I think it's saying they had an anger problem.  They walked around like a storm cloud ready to rain on anybody's parade and make a whole lot of noise doing it.  So if you look at Jesus 12, there's only one person that was educated.  Judas Iscariot.  And he betrayed Jesus to death.  The other 11 were in the ranks of the losers of society.  Gang members, murderers, tax collectors, guys that had to work for their dad because nobody else wanted them.  And Jesus picks losers.  Is not that good news for us?  I always say to people in 1 Corinthians, Paul says that God put his glory in a crowd.  It is so open.  Well, when did you get here?  When was the first time you put your glory in the light?  Wow!  The light out and so what god is saying is i have all of this greatness i want to put on display to the world i got to pick me a vessel to display my greatness how am i going to do that well it's got to be a cracked pot that's when my light can shine out of crack pots and i get all the glory and the crack pots do not walk around saying look how great i am because i am shining this light now everybody's saying you are cracked you are a mess you are broken and god says that's the ones i love to use because then my light can shine through and nobody gets confused about who the source of that light is okay next thing jesus baptism so at jesus baptism here's what happens jesus went to the galilee to the jordan river to be baptized by john after his baptism as jesus came out of the water the heavens were open and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and setting on him and a voice from heaven said this is my dearly beloved son who brings me great joy now let me give you the context of that in that culture at age 12 a boy would have a bar mitzvah and i have actually been to bar mitzvah it's a celebration of a boy moving from childhood to manhood.  It was when a father presented his son to the world as a man.  And he would stand beside his son and he would say, this is my son.  I am very pleased with him.  He's dearly loved.  And he would put his son on display and they would celebrate it.  Now I want you to think about what happened in that culture.  If you were a bastard child, if you were born out of wedlock, if your mom had an affair and got pregnant, they would not throw a bar mitzvah for a bastard child.  What was Jesus considered to be?  A bastard child.  In John 8, the rumor, we are told the rumor going around is that Mary had an affair with a Roman soldier.  That's how she got pregnant because they knew it could not have been by Joseph because they knew his character, but she was pregnant.  So they had to explain it.  And they were not saying the Holy Spirit made her pregnant.  They are saying she had an affair.  That is a bastard child.  So it is very, very possible, very likely that Jesus grew up and never had a bar mitzvah where his father stood beside him and said, this is my son.  I love him dearly.  So what does God do?  He turns 30 years old.  He has his baptism and God from heaven says, this is my kid.  And I am proud of him.

Now, hang on to that thought because I am leading somewhere with that.  I want you to think of how that applies to us.  In Roman culture, they had a different term for a bar mitzvah and it was called an adoption ceremony.  So adoption in that culture was not necessarily bringing a child from another family who was not wanted into your family.  That's how we define it.  So it's a different term.  It's a different term.  It's a different term.  It's a different term for adoption.  It's a different term to what adoption ceremony is.  It's an adoption ceremony.  And for example, if you had an adoption, that was not what adoption ceremony was.  This was an adoption ceremony for your biological son where you announced that he had become a man and you were giving him all the rights of manhood.  It was a public declaration of how proud you were of your son, just like the bar mitzvah.  Okay?  God decided to adopt us into his family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ.  This is what he wanted to do and it gave him great pleasure.

So, with us, we have two types of adoption.

First, we are brought from a family into God's family.  We are adopted that way.  We understand that but then we are adopted like a bar mitzvah and God takes us unwanted, broken by other people, people that are cracked pots and messed up.  He brings us into his family but he does not just tolerate us.  He stands beside us and he says, this is my kid and I sure love them and I am proud of them so God does not just tolerate us.  He does not just treat us like, I will put up with you but you sure are a pain.  He says, man, if you knew how crazy I was about you, even though nobody else wanted you, even though you were without a family, even though you were super messed up, I already did it with my disciples.

Now, I am going to bring you into my family but I am going to show you how to show you off and I want you to know and everybody to know that you are passionately loved and that is the greatest healer of shame is to finally have a mirror in my life that is accurate and that sends the message that is true.  I value.  I am dearly loved.  I do not care what others say.  I just care what he says.  That's what I base my value on.
