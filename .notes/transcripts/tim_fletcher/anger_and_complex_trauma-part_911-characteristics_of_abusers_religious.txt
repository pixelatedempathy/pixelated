Will he stalk me?

Will he come after me?

Will he hurt me?

And that is a significant fear.

Secondly, there's a lot of guilt.

If I leave, they'll fall apart because all they have is me.

And I'm afraid if I leave, they're going to go into a huge relapse and they're going to mess up their life.

They need me.

And so there's a lot of guilt that a lot of people have.

And the abuser can often say to you, you're the only one I have.

You're the only one who gets me.

You're the only one that understands me.

I can't get sober without you.

That sounds great, but that's a lie.

They can get sober, and there are other resources that they need to tap into.

You cannot be their higher power.

That will not work.

A big practical thing for many people is the children.

How will this affect the kids?

Let me just say this.

If you stay together with an abuser, you hurt the kids.

If you separate from an abuser, you hurt the kids.

The kids are hurt both ways.

The question is, what hurts them the least?

And I would say what hurts your kids the most is you staying.

Because at some point in time, your kids are going to resent you that you stayed in that environment and didn't take them to a safer environment.

So you might think you're protecting the kids from going through a divorce and all the mess of that, but they can get over that a lot more than if you stayed in the problem.

But it is definitely a consideration.

A big one, money.

How will I live?

Do I need to get a job?

I don't know if I can afford to be on my own.

I don't have enough to get my own apartment, et cetera, et cetera.

So I'm going to come back to that because those are very practical, very practical things that need to be considered.

Okay, how do people rationalize staying?

It's the same question.

It's just a little different perspective.

So here's what I've heard over the years because I've had many people who come to me for counseling who have stayed.

And they say, but he has such a good heart.

I just, if they just get that loved enough, then that good heart will come out.

And I go, how's that working for you so far?

They might have a good heart, but the issue is there's things that trump that good heart.

And you're not able to help them deal with those things.

And so that good heart is not going to come out as long as they stay with you.

Next one, who will help them?

All they have is me.

We've talked about that.

Third one, I'm afraid they're going to go heavy into addiction.

And I just would feel so guilty.

Bottom line, you cannot keep them sober.

You might be able to delay their heading into deeper addiction, but they're headed that way now because they're not liking themselves as an abuser.

They're totally discontent, full of anger.

And so they're heading there.

You can't prevent that by staying with them.

All they're doing is dragging you with them.

And so what you have to realize often, is somebody else might be able to help them, but I'm not the person.

I'm not strong enough to do that.

And so I have to get myself strong enough first before I can help anybody else.

So that has to be my focus.

Another common one is this.

I'm planning to leave them, but I'm going to wait till after we have our vacation together.

Or I'm planning to leave them, but we've got to get through Christmas this year, then I'll leave them.

You know what I've seen with them is three years later, they're still saying, I'm going to leave them after this.

So that doesn't hold water after a while.

It becomes a way of procrastinating what you know you need to be doing.

If you wait for the perfect circumstances, you may never leave them.

So there's going to be times, there's going to be an element where you leave them, and it's not a perfect set of circumstances.

But to stay with them makes even worse circumstances.

Okay, now let me take you to some other reasons why people don't leave.

And I'm going to take it a bit deeper for you.

I want you to think again of our limbic brain versus our cortex brain.

Do you know that abusers and those abused both tend to live in a limbic brain, which is the emotional brain, the emotional brain.

So life is decided by how do I feel.

So I will do something if I feel like it.

So what happens in a limbic brain?

You go, you just beat me up, I hate you, I'm out of here.

Limbic brain just made a decision.

Two weeks later, oh, I miss them so much, I love them so much, I'm back.

If you let the limbic brain make decisions based on how you're feeling in the moment, it's going to be a yo-yo relationship.

And you will never leave them.

So the point is this.

The limbic brain doesn't look to the facts to make a decision.

It looks to how I feel to make a decision.

The cortex brain says, yes, I miss them.

Yes, there's a part of me that still loves them.

But the facts are they've got deeper issues that if they don't deal with them, they're never going to change.

That's the facts.

And I'm not the one to help them deal with it.

I've tried.

They've got to get outside help.

That's the facts.

So I'm not going to let my emotions cloud my decisions.

I know what the right thing to do is regardless of how I feel on any given day.

So the cortex has to come into play if you're going to leave an abuser.

If you stay in your limbic, you set yourself up, to never leave or to leave and keep coming back.

Next thing is the shame.

I want to give you a different angle on this.

What shame is, is others didn't respect me as a child, so now I don't respect myself.

So if somebody abuses me, I think I probably deserve it, or I think I can't do better than this, but I'm never going to stand up for myself.

So the point is this.

Until you respect yourself, you're not going to require anybody else to respect you.

If you don't respect yourself and you don't stand up for yourself, why should anybody else respect you?

They're just treating you how you feel about yourself.

And so you're only going to stand up and say no more to an abuser until you respect yourself.

Now let me go back to limbic and cortex.

Cortex brain says, I don't feel a lot of positive feelings for myself, but I know I have value, so I will stand up for myself even though I still feel unimportant.

I will treat myself with respect even though I don't feel it.

The limbic brain says, I don't feel respect for myself, so I don't respect myself.

So I never will respect myself because I never feel respect for myself.

So you've got to switch to the cortex and say, I don't feel respect for myself.

I don't feel respect for myself.

So you've got to switch to the cortex and say, I have value.

I'm worth fighting for.

I'm worth setting boundaries for.

I'm worth getting healthy.

And I'm going to start standing up for me.

Now that initially will feel selfish.

But that is not.

That is healthy.

That is finally giving yourself the respect that you deserve because of the value inherent in you.

The longer you stay in an abusive relationship, the worse your shame gets.

The lower your self-esteem gets.

Okay, a couple more things.

Practical guidelines.

What I say to clients all the time is this.

Don't leave an abusive relationship till you're ready to stay gone.

Until you're ready to enforce it.

Don't say, I'm out of here and two weeks later you're back.

So think through a very careful plan about what you need to do in order to stick to that I'm gone.

Think through your finances.

Think through your safety.

Think through the kid's situation.

All of those things come up with a well thought out plan so when you finally say it's done, you're going to enforce that and stick to it.

That is so essential because if you go back, what have you just trained the abuser?

You've just trained them that your no doesn't mean no.

You've trained them that if they say no, they can manipulate you over time to get you back and the next time they're going to try harder and it's going to be harder to enforce your boundary.

So think it through carefully.

Third thing, be prepared for backlash.

A narcissist doesn't like somebody saying no to them.

A narcissist doesn't like somebody saying, we're done, I don't want to be around you.

That makes them look bad.

So they can go on the attack.

Be prepared for that and that's got to be part of your plan.

I'm going to stick to my guns even though World War III erupts.

And then be prepared for a variety of emotions that you're going to go through once you end it.

Yes, you'll be angry for a while but then you're going to miss them.

And then you're going to feel love for them.

Then you're going to feel guilt.

Then you're going to be confused.

And then you'll go through a time of grief.

You're not just going to be angry constantly, you're going to have a whole roller coaster ride of different emotions.

Be prepared for that.

Two final things.

And these questions I get asked all the time.

So let's say you're in an abusive relationship and you say it's done.

But they say, okay, I'll go for help.

I'll go to REACT.

I'll get counseling.

Should I wait for them?

That is a very tricky question.

Here's what happens.

If they go to REACT knowing that you're going to wait for them and they go through REACT and they come back, how do you know they did it for the right reasons?

Did they do it for you or did they do it to get you back?

Or did they do it for themselves or did they do it just to get you back?

So you're not going to ever know that they're going to do it for themselves until you're out of the picture.

As long as you're still in the picture, you're always going to wonder are they truly sincere in their desire to change?

Or is this another smoke screen to make it look like they're trying to get help when they're really just trying to reel me back in?

The next one, if you end it, is it ever possible one day to get back together?

I would say in very, very rare occasions.

Usually, once you would try to get back together, it's too easy to go back to the old behaviors where you left off.

And you all know each other's baggage.

And so it just is such a difficult thing.

So what I say to clients is this, you might not feel that you can say it's done forever.

I get that.

But at least agree that it's done for a long period of time.

Give yourself a year at least.

Then maybe in a year your feelings will have changed and at that point you can say it's done forever.

You can't say that now, so let's do it in a two-step process.

And let's just get through a year of this is done and then see where you're at.

So if you're in a relationship with a person that's beginning to show those characteristics, I really hope that you can say, I'm worth fighting for and protecting.

I want to end this before it gets really nasty because I know where this can go.

And it's probably where it will go.

So I hope that gives you a little bit of practical stuff.

That's the end of part one.

We're going to have Melissa, Reagan and Bruno come on up.

And sing again.

Then we're going to go into the...

So I want to take the Christian part and this anger series in a little different direction tonight, which might surprise you, but I actually want to talk about prayer.

And what I have found over the years of working with people with complex trauma who come out of families that produce complex trauma is that often they see God as being kind of like their parents.

So if their parents were unavailable, neglectful, distant, they kind of picture God as being that way.

If their parents were angry and abusive, they kind of picture God as an angry God.

And so that has a profound effect on how they approach prayer.

Okay?

Second piece with this prayer is I would think is...

I've seen as people decide I want a relationship with God, one of the first things that they have questions about and are very confused about is prayer.

So they go, do I cross myself?

Do I have to pray a certain way?

Do I have to get on my knees?

Do I have to end in Jesus' name?

Do I got to make sure I go on a certain order?

And they get themselves all in a tizzy and a knot about how to pray.

And then they hear some wacko who says they got to do it a certain way then they feel all guilty and God must be disappointed in me.

And it just becomes a very difficult topic for them.

So I want to talk about prayer from those two vantage points.

And I hope that it just helps you get some insight and helps you in your own journey.

So I want to say in Matthew 6 is written, is where the Lord's Prayer is recorded.

And so a lot of 12-step groups still end by saying the Lord's Prayer together.

Many of you grew up in school saying it and it's one of the most well-known prayers in the world.

What people don't know is before he starts the Lord's Prayer, he talks about the abuses of prayer or the dangers people have when they start looking at prayer in their life.

And what you're going to see is that Jesus is going to address the very things that I've talked about right up front and it'll hopefully be refreshing.

So misuse number one is people use prayer as an image thing.

So you might have a person who gets all pious when they pray and they talk in a little different voice and they use different words and they act super spiritual and you go, whoo, that is some super Christian.

And it's all based on how they pray.

And then they can tell you, I pray for an hour every morning.

And you go, wow, I am impressed with this person.

And you know what?

They may be a total hypocrite.

And so the first thing Jesus says is this, when you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly, on street corners and in the synagogue where everybody can see them.

So the religious leaders of that day purposely went to the busiest street corner of town and prayed loud.

So everybody would stop and go, wow, look at that person.

It was all to feed their ego.

When you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you and pray to your Father in private.

And remember he's not saying you should literally go and get in a closet and make sure nobody sees you.

He's talking about your heart attitude.

That your heart attitude in prayer is this is not being done for spectators.

This is being done to communicate with God.

So that becomes the heart thing.

So that's abuse number one.

But the second one is the main one he talks about.

And it really brings in talking about tonight do you realize that Jesus grew up in a crop in a complex trauma world and it was a shame-based world so that the predominant belief in all the world religions at the time of Jesus was that that God was a distant angry being so therefore the purpose of prayer was to manipulate that God so that's an angry God who doesn't want to give you anything he just wants to punish you so how do you get him to give you good things and not punish you you use prayer to manipulate them so they developed all kinds of things about how to pray to get God to give you what you want doesn't that sound like today a little bit so a lot of churches sadly today prayer has become nothing more than how can you manipulate God to give you what you want and so I can get really worked up at times around this abusive prayer that I see in churches today because it is so prevalent so here's what Jesus says when you pray don't babble on and on as the pagans do they think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again again do you know what I hear sometimes today is keep asking God keep asking God badger God with the same request and then he'll give it to you that's what he's saying don't do and then he says don't be like them for your father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him so he is saying what's the point of prayer it shouldn't be just a shopping list where you say God give me this this to this and this he already knows what you need you don't need to report a shopping list but that is what he has become the focus in many churches around God so let me give you some of the things they use today to tell you how to manipulate God so they will put it in terms of how to have authority and prayer how to have power in prayer and it sounds great but for many people it's still seeing God as a a disinterested deity that you somehow have to cajole and they're giving you just these nice things but so I can take out all the Kubbr fans the support for you and kind ofines the you what you want so number one is they take john 14 14 that says jesus says you may ask for anything in my name and i will do it and so what they say is you have to pray in jesus name so if you listen to 99 of christians today when they pray they end their prayers by saying in jesus name amen do you realize that's not what jesus was saying here do you not know what it meant to pray in jesus name so it was the son praying in the son's name to the father so if i was a friend of the son and i wanted to make a request to the the friend's father the son's father i wouldn't go and say give me something that your son would never want but i'll pray in his name and that way you'll give it to me no it meant pray what my son would want line up your desires with his so you're praying as if it's him praying for things so that's what praying in jesus name means so if you ever listen to me pray i never answer my and my prayers in jesus name because in my mind it's time to get rid of that bad thinking that's not what that means it really is praying in line with what jesus would want but some people say if you claim it in jesus name and claim his name that'll give you power with god that is an abuse of that whole verse second thing they say matthew 21 if you believe you will receive whatever you ask so they say just have faith okay now what they would say like i got a guy that did this okay he went to a friend and he says i have faith god is going to give me a quarter of a million dollars so i am going to pray and trust god's going to give me a quarter million dollars and has him as a scribe and i knew he claimed all his money and so the first thing you should do is write got a give a quarter of a million and then you should give god a quarter of a million dollars whatever it is that you want to extend your prayer if god wants to in jesus name and i'm not saying i'm going to do this that's pretty difficult it's better to do it in your own way so let's focus on that so this is the first thing if you do this properly because as far as being pious as to what the mind thinks about in this page i'll give you a lot of information but i also what you've promised it is not saying i want this so i'm going to trust you as a way of manipulating you so it's another abuse of a biblical term but what i want you to see is they're all based on god is a remote disinterested deity who's often angry who doesn't really care about your needs so prayer is the way to manipulate him do you realize how opposite that is of god's true character so let me take you to then what is prayer about if you want to think of prayer change it out of a religious language and just say this prayer is communication between two friends so when i go home and talk with my wife you could go say i go home and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife and pray with my wife.

We just communicate, okay?

Now take that further.

When I go home and talk with my wife or I pray, I don't go and say, here's my shopping list.

Would you please do this?

Will you please do this?

I know you really don't like me, but would you mind giving me a hug today?

I don't go like that.

And I don't go and say, my dear great wife, I get on my knees and please bless me today.

I go and share my heart.

It is heart communication.

It is heart openness.

I can go for weeks without asking for anything.

I spend time telling her how I'm doing.

I ask not for something I want, but I ask how she's doing.

It is a way of connecting hearts and deepening intimacy and getting to know each other better.

That is what prayer is designed to be.

Now let me take that further.

In a relationship that's healthy, most of our communication is spontaneous.

I'll go home tonight and I'll just say, how are you feeling?

And we'll connect.

But it's not just spontaneous times of talking.

We also have a set time each week that we set aside just to make sure we talk at a deep level.

So prayer doesn't just have to be, I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock in the morning.

I'm going to do this at six o'clock every morning for 15 minutes.

Then I've done my prayer.

Do you realize that often I wake up and I realize I was praying as I came into consciousness?

And I pray subconsciously throughout the day.

Sometimes it comes to my conscious mind.

And then I have set times where I talk to God.

But most of the prayer is just spontaneous, instantaneous as things are going on in my day.

It is communication.

Now let me take that a step further because there's a very key thing.

When you look at the Lord's Prayer, Jesus is actually not focusing on pray these words.

He is saying pray with these attitudes.

Nowhere in the Bible does Jesus tell you when to pray, how long to pray, whether you should be on your knees, whether you should fold your hands.

He doesn't go into any externals about prayer.

He only tells you the attitudes you should have.

If you have the right attitude, the externals will take care of themselves.

And you might have times where you just fall on your knees and that is just it's in keeping with what you're feeling in your attitudes.

But you might have other times where you pray as you walk, as you drive and that still the attitude is right.

So the focus of prayer is attitudes, not externals.

The danger for a lot of new people coming into churches is that churches tend to get preoccupied with external things.

And you don't want to get with externals and so they come in and they get told you need to pray at this time so many times a day and go this body position and they get all wrapped up in externals and jesus says no internal attitudes is what it's all about and that is the whole focus so if i went home and i said with a closed heart to my wife here's my list how are you doing today i had a good day tell me what you're doing tomorrow we just communicated no we did not we talked but the attitude wasn't there if i go home with the right attitude it doesn't matter if i'm sitting on the couch if i'm standing looking at her if i'm lying in bed if the right attitude is there we will communicate and it will go beyond talking and so jesus is saying what is get the attitude right and what is it it's it's a longing to connect with god it is a longing for an intimate relationship it's a longing to have his heart in my life it's a longing for a life that is dependent and growing in a relationship with him that's the longing and prayer just put words to that so here's a quote i came across that i love true prayer is not first external words it is a longing to connect with god it is a heart attitude the external words have meaning only if they express the right heart attitude the concern of god is not that you say the right words but that you long for the right things it's your heart condition that's his concern now one of the things that i often do with addicts when they start talking about this is i say how many of you have had times in your life where there's been a groan in your heart that is so deep you can't find words for it it's just a groan and they all put up their hands because you've had that pain that depression and so i say that at times in my life is how i pray i'll go home and i say to kim it was a groan day and she knows what i mean she knows that there was a pain and a longing so deep i couldn't find words for so just a groan came out and here's what i have confidence in in romans 8 god says he hears our groans and he puts words to them for us so he interprets groans and knows what we're actually praying for sometimes i pray without saying words at all or even groaning i listen to music and i just feel my heart starting to warm and adore and open up to god that's prayer that's communicating all of those become good one of the reasons i love the psalms and we've been going through some of the psalms is the psalms was a a songbook we talked about that but it was also a poetic journal but it was also a prayer journal and what you find in the prayers of the psalms is raw honesty real authenticity real emotions and like i said last week when we talked about being angry at god god wants us to be real and authentic he wants us to process that but that's what prayer is expressing i am struggling today god i'm having a bad day i am really upset today with you because i'm not sure what you're doing i am really feeling a lot of anxiety and i don't know what to do with it you're just talking it out i got asked this week this question i'll end with this they said tim you're a very reserved person you don't express visibly a lot of emotions you're pretty level guy what do you do when you feel strong emotions so i said first you need to understand i feel strong emotions but in a leadership role you got to have a lot of filters to before you can express some of that so they said what do you do with those strong emotions if you can't express them i go that's one of the key parts of my relationship with god i can take whatever powerful emotion i have and the first place i go is up and i talk to him about it i express it and that helps me regulate and process a lot of those deep painful emotions so i hope that helps you on prayer don't get hung up on doing it a certain way or getting it right just get hung up on i want to get to know this god and have a relationship and let come out what comes out well i gotta add one more thing so if to time you're wanting to pray wear this il Мосkwik um as the time of time in this message prior to coming out of the church one of the other things that i'm getting criticized for but most of you appreciate is that i strongly believe the bible God and they would drop an F-bomb here and they're just letting it out and all the Christians are going oh they can't talk like that I says yeah God's good with that they're just being real in their prayer life they're just talking with the best adjectives they know and God loves that
