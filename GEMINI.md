## 🧠 Emotional Intelligence Engine

We utilize a sophisticated hybrid model to understand the human psyche:
- **Emotional Taxonomy**: Plutchik's Wheel (Basic & Advanced) + Big Five (OCEAN) traits.
- **Representation**: Normalized scores (0.0 to 1.0) for all intensities.
- **Conversational Dynamics**: Analyzing tone, flow, reciprocity, and the "power of silence."
- **Dual-Persona**: Adaptive intelligence that recognizes shifting roles (Mentor, Peer, Help-seeker).
