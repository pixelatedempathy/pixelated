Hi and welcome to this week's Wuwai Wisdom Life Lessons teaching. It's great to be back with you all. This week we are talking all about attention seeking behavior, how to spot it if this is you and how to unlock the root causes that are driving it so you never have to crave attention or validation from other people again. Okay David, I know this attention seeking and craving external validation is a big issue for a lot of your clients. Can you give me some examples of how it drives their behavior and affects their life? Well it would manifest in somebody that's always looking for that approval or validation external to them. So they want to be told that everything that they did is at the high standard or a word I often hear when I'm working with these clients is perfect. It has to be perfect. So they want to see that perhaps in their career that they're getting the top marks, their line manager values them, likes them, likes them above others, doesn't promote somebody or put somebody above them. But at home and a family it's more about wanting that approval and validation. So they want to see that. So they want to see that. So they want to see that. So they want to see that reassurance, that constant validation. If you think about that word validation, the giving of value, and then you start to get to the root of this issue that you need to address and why it's a spiritual issue. And David, before we move on to I guess the root causes, I guess the consequence of allowing our thought patterns, our choices, our actions to be very much focused and driven by seeking validation, seeking attention, seeking positive strokes from other people is I guess a constant sense of dissatisfaction, of wanting more, of never being happy with yourself, of being addicted to getting this positive feedback. Well, the important word you use in that question, Alex, was seeking. So seeking is your direction of travel. And if you're looking constantly externally to something or someone else to give you that worth and value, your path, your journey will never be satisfied because you're moving away from your innate spirituality and you're looking to gain that validation, that value and worth. And that's what I'm talking about. And that's what I'm looking to achieve. And so as we talk about how two li забaux inspire rapid growth, we can connect with inner spiritual worth. So end point three, someone comes in, grasping just to get that final approval or for somebody to tell you and then you can drop your shoulders and say there you are i am now okay but of course this never happens and so you're always seeking you're always on that journey and the problem with this journey is taking you away from who you really are in your core and i i suppose the attention seeking behavior as well manifests in some people quite overtly so in the the trappings of status and wealth and and their looks and how they dress in in terms of that being a really high priority for them to get positive validation and strokes and feedback from other people based on those things but it also can be the things we do quietly um which are not so um which are not so um which are not so overt in terms of being attention seeking overt in terms of being attention seeking overt in terms of being attention seeking so it could be working really really hard you know your work life balance being out of kilter because you believe you need to put more hours into work to get praise either from your boss or praise from your parents because you have you know you reach a certain achievement in your career and so it can be the quieter behind the scenes the quieter behind the scenes is it feels quite improved and so you know the difficulties that are really so very much weigh in on it which is authentic process mother we will have to let those goals in reflect as tired in the moment we might be before we go on to resume today's journey when this journey and this concern that we've all been dying for comes to us would not be possible without ending that journey in a positive and positive way to try and please them to get that kind of drug as you called it which is a good way of thinking about it that drug that they like you and if you please them they're going to like you more and then you're on the merry-go-round as well I think one of the greatest spiritual teachings about this is what other people think of you is none of your business really what is your business is what you think about you and this idea of searching for validation searching for approval attention seeking why do you need attention why do you need everybody to give you attention and then the strangest thing that I find when I'm working with clients if you get attention it's not the right attention you actually would scorn attention and I often say it's almost like you want to walk into a room and people to themselves all behind like saying oh my goodness look who's just come in it's that Alex isn't she great oh I really love her oh I watch her you want that kind of it's a really funny thing because if they came to you and said oh Alex I think you're wonderful I love you so much you wouldn't want that so it's a very subtle clever kind of thing that really the part of you that we call the inner child is searching for and so David this is where we start looking at the I guess the origins of this behaviour because this is not something that just we wake up one morning and we are fixated by seeking attention and approval from others this is like learned behaviour that has evolved from our childhood and would you say for most of the clients that you work with on this issue it has its roots in childhood I would say that Alex I don't never like to say a hundred percent because that can't be true but the majority of my clients this would be what we would call the inner child work and this forms this is nothing kind of mysterious when we're a child we believe that our value and our worth come from the authority figures around us parents teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers teachers номina's speech bekora Ir uneven things are automatical so we gotta try to reconstruct this wack problem we make mistakes mistakes mistakes routines we learn them later and realize if that is our game then obviously something like I don't care whether my child is or she is or maybe it started a little longer than I intended to imagine otherwise they cannot be engaged with us domestic racism an art of learning may be that we may accept things that are divorce everything but when Respect Folk is born when respect is born nowadays our generations we are made up of hopes we believe we all have the potential we feel that it is true that we have to do something that is better than what it is that is right now that we need to learn that that's one thing that's sure and enough we can come them in and we have three things in already so if you were going now we know we're trying to do more we're trying to please more to more and more disappointed, we get more and more disillusioned, and then becomes very important, what we call the vow. When you don't get that magic elixir, you then say, well, it must be me. There's something wrong with me. Because if I was perfect, good, wonderful, wouldn't everybody give it to me? Why can't I get it? Why am I not receiving it? I'm doing the best that I can, so it must be me. And then that starts the process. Many of my clients will build up the story. The story then becomes their identity. Then it becomes self-fulfilling. All the stuff we talk about in our videos, which is so vitally important, because every step you take, every step you take down this road, you're stepping away from who you really are. The spirituality, the amazingness, the awesomeness of who you really are. And you doubt yourself. And you're looking for others to kind of fulfill that hole that you're busily digging, and you want them to top it up. And the truth is, there is no hole, there is no void, there is no lack within you. And so, as you say, it's the emotional conditioning with most of us experiencing in our childhood, which are, I guess, our parents perceived as good parenting, a kind of a healthy way to parent. But the problem is then it puts us on this cycle of looking to others to know that we're a good person, to know that we're good enough. And not only, as you say, this emotional conditioning is inappropriate, because it doesn't teach us to value ourselves and look within. But if we compound that with childhood experiences where our needs are not met, so we look for approval, reassurance, the pat on the back, the kind words, and they're not forthcoming because our parents are busy, because our parents were arguing, because our parents were arguing, one of our parents left the family home, all sorts of reasons that we can perceive that we're doing something wrong as a child, and we don't get the needs met, then as a child, we don't say to ourselves, well, this system of conditioning and approval, this doesn't make sense. I'm going to ditch this and start self-referring. Instead, of course, we don't think that. We just work harder on the same system in order to try and get this done. So, I think that's a big part of it. And we look at those unmet needs met, and we carry that system right through into adulthood. And this is where, as the adult, we are still craving attention, validation, positive strokes, pats on the back. That's right, Alex. It's very powerful because it's like a big hole, as you quite rightly said, that you perceive. And lots of my clients will hold their chest and say there's something hollow in me, there's something missing in me. One of my clients said a few weeks ago, it's like a jigsaw puzzle, beautifully made, but there's a few pieces missing, as in the middle. And as Alex has just quite rightly explained, this comes back, and this is why I really value the idea of the inner child. It's a part of your mind that's kind of frozen or stuck in these childhood experiences. If you relate to this, please look at our archive, and you'll find a lot of archives on the inner child work, because this happened around the age of six to nine years old. And because like a child, when your needs are unmet, you then create emotions to get attention. That's why children create emotions. That's why they have temper tantrums, and why I like the word squealing piglets, because they want to get the attention. They like the attention they're getting, but at least it's attention. And for a child that they don't understand this, we can analyse this now, that attention relates to value and worth. So the attention is franking and confirming their absolute value and worth. And if they don't get it, then they blame themselves. And it can be so important, and I know that in my life, I was told to love myself and to care for myself was selfish. It's selfish. You should put other people in front of you. And so we get these very confusing teachings as a child. And if we don't do this work, what we call the golden thread, the self referring back to look at yourself, what you believe, what you believe, and if you believe in your beliefs, to see what you believe, how many times do I say this on these videos? What do you believe? Why do you believe it? If you believe that you have no value and worth, why do you believe that? Or do you believe that value and worth is innate? Every child has it. If you believe that, then why are you looking for validation? Why is it so? It's just a question of your inner child, and you are under the influence of the red light feelings. I just want to flag up a bit of a paradox here that I think most people, if they can identify that they have some part of them, their inner child, which is driving a need for external validation, they can identify that it comes from the emotional conditioning and unmet needs. On the flip side of that though, did have their needs met in childhood and they had everything done for them and they were praised to the skies and back and they were told they were wonderful they were wrapped in cotton wool there was never any upsets or inconvenience they were treated like a prince or a princess and in some ways that still fosters the attention seeking behavior in adulthood because those people expect more of the same they they want they love that feeling of that drug of adoration and that it almost always should come externally rather than it's my responsibility to make me feel good and to value myself they got so used in childhood to having the praise heaped on them that they want more of the same as adults that's right alex and what you're describing here is what we call in our model the emotional pendulum and so sometimes as alex has said this can be perplexing and paradoxical that yes you can have a dysfunctional childhood where your needs are not meant you're ignored and maybe somehow abused but you can be the other side of that pendulum and as alex says you can be wrapped in cotton wool and be treated like a princess or a prince and you're number one in every way you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and the problem with both ends of this pendulum is this is not reality this is not the reality that we live in real life if you prefer this is why the concept of wu-wei living in balance living in flow living in harmony because if you over indulge your child spoil your child give your child everything that they want where as when they want it you want to be the other way around and you can you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and you can be the other way around and you can not preparing them for real life so when they hit real life they have as much problems and issues as somebody who's been neglected because actually if they're not emotionally or mentally equipped for the reality of life and this is why many of my clients will be stuck in one extreme and the other but many will also swing from one side to the other to believe they're special but many will also swing from one side to the other to believe they're special to believe that people should treat them differently and to always be looking for others to be fulfilling that need and they'll get themselves so confused in this swinging pendulum effect and david in terms of solutions then we've talked about in a child recognizing that this inner child part of our psyche recognizing that this inner child part of our psyche is operating this on this poor is operating this on this poor emotional state of our font we see it as being a sort of a emotional state of our font we see it as being a sort of a conditioning still still craving not looking within so we know there's inner child work involved here but there's also perhaps a more important process of truly connecting to our intrinsic worth and value what you would call the sharing the spiritual self the authentic self do you want to talk a little bit more about that yes thanks Alex because I think that's really important and I think that's what distinguishes our models from other great models out there that you might be looking at because at the base of our model is the acceptance that we have intrinsic innate value and worth I call it Shen you can call it whatever you want but that's something that is not given to us or can be taken away from us and I often use the example when a baby is born or if you've given birth to a baby and you've given birth to a baby and you've given birth to a baby or for a man been in the delivery room and your child has been delivered the midwife doesn't hold the baby up and says quick can somebody give this baby some value and worth value and worth is inherent it is who we are we have a spiritual essence we don't have to look outside of ourselves and once you doubt that spirituality of who you really are you are now on the wrong road you are now moving away and this is very important do you believe that or do you believe that you missed out on your spirituality or do you believe like a lot of my clients that somehow your Shen can be diluted withdrawn from you that your Shen needs other people to top it up that baby needs to be taken away from you that baby needs to be taken away from you that baby needs to be taken away from you needs something else a baby isn't valuable as a spiritual being and I think that's the core of the teaching of Wu Wei wisdom do you believe that and then you start to build the model on that core belief without a doubt ask yourself when you finish watching this video without any doubt without even a fraction a grain of doubt do I believe I am innate I have worth I have value that cannot be diluted or tampered with doesn't matter what goes on in my physical life that innate worth and value is divine and that's what I say you are a divine person awesome there is no one in the universe like you never never doubt yourself and I think David I can put links in the show notes to not only our inner child and inner child reparenting video playlist but also our Shen and authentic self video playlist and there's lots and lots of teachings on there to help you with I guess this twofold approach to reparenting the inner child and explaining to our in a child that you know we don't need to look externally to know we are enough to know we are lovable to know we can cope and then also from the Shen playlist to understand more about what is good for you so that you can have a different life that you are not guilty of what is this beautiful thing, the Shen that we have within us, that is our true worth and true value and how we can connect to that. It's very important, Alex, and for many of my clients, they've spent a lifetime on doubting their Shen, on moving away, of looking, of being guided by their emotions without realising that they create their emotions. Again, this is a really fundamental part of this model that you're looking at with us now. Do you 100% believe that you are the creator of your emotions? I'm not saying you shouldn't create emotions. I'm not saying emotions are wrong. I'm saying emotions are wonderful, but you create them. Nobody else transports an emotion into your body. You are not a victim. Can I repeat? You are not a victim. You are a divine spiritual person. And when you put those doubts in, it doesn't go away, but it's like you've caught the train to another destination. You're moving away from who you really are. You're denying yourself. This is why these teachings are so valuable. Nobody can give you, you've already got it. Nobody can make it more. Nobody can take it away from you. It's yours. It's your birthright. And that's how you create your emotions. You should think about it without a grain of doubt. This is your birthright. So when we say I'm feeling needy, I'm feeling not enough and feeling dissatisfied, I'm feeling empty, craving, craving, craving this external validation, that acknowledgement that those feelings, those red light emotions that we're describing under different labels, but essentially they're uncomfortable, they're painful, they're not good, they're not good. And so we have to take responsibility for those emotions. When we own the fact that I, you know, I'm creating those emotions because what I'm thinking of believing here because of the emotional conditioning that I took on as a child, because I didn't know any better as a child, but I now have to take responsibility. Do I want to keep running this system and experiencing these red light emotions? That's right, Alex. I think a simple statement, I'm always trying to make it easy and simple. A lot of my clients, again, will want the world to change, reality to change. And the truth is, only you can change. And you have to understand these beliefs. You have to understand that your beliefs create your emotions, right or wrong, but that's what's happening. Then you have to look at that very simple question. What do I believe and why do I believe that? And we always recommend you try this Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. We call it the Shen test. If you find a belief, say, for instance, we're talking about value. If you find a belief, yes, I believe there is something missing in me. I believe my value is diminished. Would you say that to your physical child? And you would laugh and nod your head and say, never say that. Of course I wouldn't. It'd be cruel. Then why are you saying it to yourself? And we try and simplify it. We try and simplify these techniques. These are the subliminal messages that you're giving to yourself all the time. When you say there's something wrong with me, I'm not good enough. I can't cope. I'm unlovable. I'm unworthy. There's something missing as a whole in me. You would never say that to your child, but you are saying it to your inner child and you're constantly saying it and confirming it. Give them your time and use them as you did from the outside, now that you've said that. You just don't stop youravia. So I wanted to call a few things away is. Confront yourself. Very often us, the два, I realize that I'm enjoying and loving what we're trying to do. Sometimes whether it's that level of freedom that you have in and of yourself, or not in the comic industry, and you're trying to overcome ourselves, it turns out that it doesn't really do you з Only real thinking. You're just not in it for yourself. You do this with your heart. You know, you don't know what you're doing, anyway. It's all about science. but to yourself. You are lying to yourself. But more importantly, we've tried to demonstrate, you've caught the train, you've paid the ticket, and you're on the track way away from who you really are. The essence of your divinity, your divine nature, your awesomeness. Whether you like it or not, you are awesome. Because we all are. We are unique. There is no one in the universe like you. And it's now you should be on your path to reach your true potential. Whatever that is, that is your responsibility to be on your correct spiritual path. Thank you, David. Wonderful.
